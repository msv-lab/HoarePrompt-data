Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly solves the problem as described. The function `func_1` returns the sublist from the input list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` effectively compares the sublists based on their sums and returns the one with the maximum sum.

The output hints provide additional details that align with the code's behavior. For instance, if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them, which is a valid interpretation of the problem description. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the original list of lists and handles the case where the input list is empty by raising a ValueError, which is consistent with how Python's built-in `max` function behaves when given an empty iterable. The code correctly handles empty sublists, considering them to have a sum of 0, and it works with both integers and floats.

Given the assumptions that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list of lists containing numbers), the code does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs like non-list inputs, non-numeric values in sublists, or negative numbers if the problem description specifies that all numbers are positive. Therefore, based on the problem description and the behavior described in the output hints, the code is correct for all potential valid cases.
