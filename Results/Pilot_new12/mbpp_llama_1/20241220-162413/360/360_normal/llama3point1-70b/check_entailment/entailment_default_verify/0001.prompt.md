You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it successfully implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as an input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. 

Here's why it works:

- The built-in `max` function is used to find the maximum item in an iterable (in this case, `lists`).
- The `key` parameter of the `max` function is a function that takes one argument and returns one value. It is used to determine the sort order.
- By setting `key=sum`, the `max` function compares the sums of the sublists when determining which sublist is the maximum.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return the first one it encounters, as it stops comparing as soon as it finds the first maximum.

There are no edge cases or potential cases that the code does not handle. For example, it correctly handles empty sublists (sum of an empty list is 0), sublists containing non-numeric values (this would raise a TypeError, which is the expected behavior since the problem description doesn't specify what to do in this case), and an empty list of lists (this would raise a ValueError, which is the expected behavior since the problem description doesn't specify what to do in this case). 

Even though there are some edge cases where the program raises an exception, like an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values, the program description does not specify the expected behavior in these cases. However, the program can be considered correct for the specified problem description, considering that the user will provide valid input. 

It is also worth noting that Python's built-in functions and data structures are usually well-tested and reliable, so unless there is a specific reason to believe otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that `max` and `sum` will work as expected. 

Finally, without any additional information about the expected behavior in edge cases, the program can be considered correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the original list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the input list contains empty sublists, they will be considered with a sum of 0. The function handles both integers and floats as valid numbers in the sublists. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
