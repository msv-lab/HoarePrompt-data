Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The provided Python function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's why it always works as expected:

1. The `max` function is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`. This means that `max` will return the sublist from `lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements.
2. The `sum` function calculates the sum of all elements in a sublist. This sum is used as the key for comparing sublists.
3. Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of lists containing numbers), the `func_1` function does not need to handle any potential errors.

In every possible case where the input is a valid list of lists containing numbers, `func_1` will return the sublist with the highest sum of its elements, which matches the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
