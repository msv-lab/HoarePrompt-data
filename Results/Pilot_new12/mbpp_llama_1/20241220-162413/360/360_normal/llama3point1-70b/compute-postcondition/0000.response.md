To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state describes `lists` as a list of lists, where each sublist contains only numbers (either integers or floats). The code snippet is `return max(lists, key=sum)`. This means the program will return the sublist from `lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements.

Given that `lists` is a list of lists of numbers, the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument will compare the sums of the sublists to find the maximum. The `sum` function adds up all the elements in a sublist, and `max` then returns the sublist with the greatest sum.

Therefore, the output of the program will be the sublist from `lists` that has the highest sum of its elements. This sublist contains numbers (either integers or floats), and its specific elements and their sum depend on the initial values in `lists`.

Output State: **The program returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements from the list of lists 'lists', where each sublist contains numbers (either integers or floats)**.
