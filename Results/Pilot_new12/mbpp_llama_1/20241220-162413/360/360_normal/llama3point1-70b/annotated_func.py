#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only numbers (either integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements from the list of lists 'lists', where each sublist contains numbers (either integers or floats)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the original list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the input list contains empty sublists, they will be considered with a sum of 0. The function handles both integers and floats as valid numbers in the sublists. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy.
