#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from the original `arr`, and if `arr` is not empty, `num` is the last integer in `arr`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks for duplicate integers in a given list `arr` and returns `True` if any duplicates are found, and `False` otherwise. The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. Upon execution, the function leaves the original list `arr` unchanged. It handles edge cases, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements, including those with and without duplicates. The function's return value indicates whether the input list contains any duplicate integers, providing a clear result for all possible input cases, including the edge cases of empty or single-element lists, where it correctly returns `False`.
