Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a correct implementation of the problem description. It checks for duplicate integers in a given list and returns `True` if any duplicates are found, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements, including those with and without duplicates. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the correctness of the function for various scenarios. The function uses a `set` to keep track of the elements it has seen so far, which allows it to check for duplicates in O(n) time complexity. The function also leaves the original list unchanged, as required.

Since the code handles all potential cases, including edge cases, and the provided unit tests confirm its correctness, we can conclude that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
