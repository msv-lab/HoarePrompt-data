Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I agree with the original assessment that the program is correct.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the state of the program at different points, but it does not reveal any discrepancies with the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the input list, checks for duplicates using a set, and returns a boolean value indicating whether any duplicates were found.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), and that it handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function leaves the original list unchanged and returns the correct result for all possible input cases, including edge cases.

Therefore, I see no reason to change the original assessment, and I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
