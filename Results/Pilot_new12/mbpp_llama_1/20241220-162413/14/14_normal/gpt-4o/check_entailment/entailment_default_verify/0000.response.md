Based on the provided code, problem description, original assessment, and output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. This assessment is supported by the provided code, which uses a set `seen` to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.

The output hints further validate the correctness of the function by stating that it:

* Checks for duplicate integers in a given list `arr`
* Returns `True` if any duplicates are found and `False` otherwise
* Accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value
* Leaves the original list `arr` unchanged
* Handles edge cases, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements, including those with and without duplicates

The code implementation aligns with these hints, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and based on the problem description, the program, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
