Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element, and the provided function `func_1` accomplishes this task.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the function is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty set `seen` to store the unique integers encountered so far.
2. It then iterates over each integer `num` in the input list `arr`.
3. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, it means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns `True`.
4. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the set and continues to the next iteration.
5. If the function completes the iteration over the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain any duplicate elements.

The function handles all possible cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function will return `False` for an empty list because it doesn't contain any elements to compare.
* Lists with a single element: The function will return `False` for a list with a single element because there are no other elements to compare with.
* Lists with multiple elements: The function will correctly identify duplicates and return `True` if any are found, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness by covering different scenarios, including lists with and without duplicates.

In conclusion, the program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all possible input cases.
