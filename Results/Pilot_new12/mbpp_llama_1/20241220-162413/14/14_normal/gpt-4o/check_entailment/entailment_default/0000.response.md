Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly checks for duplicate integers in a given list `arr` and returns `True` if any duplicates are found, and `False` otherwise. Here's why:

- It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of unique integers encountered so far.
- It iterates over each number `num` in the input list `arr`.
- For each `num`, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, that means `num` has been seen before, and thus, it's a duplicate, so the function immediately returns `True`.
- If `num` is not in `seen`, it adds `num` to `seen` to mark it as encountered.
- If it iterates through the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles the following cases:
- An empty list: Since there are no elements, there cannot be any duplicates, so it correctly returns `False`.
- A list with a single element: There are no duplicates since there's only one unique element, so it correctly returns `False`.
- Lists with multiple elements:
  - With duplicates: It correctly identifies duplicates and returns `True`.
  - Without duplicates: Since all elements are unique, it correctly returns `False`.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that it handles the edge cases correctly and provides the expected boolean return value for all possible input cases. 

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code works as expected for all described cases.
