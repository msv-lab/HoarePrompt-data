Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly identify whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the unique elements encountered so far. 

Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:

1. It initializes an empty set `seen`.
2. It iterates through each number `num` in the input array `arr`.
3. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set. If it is, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate element has been found.
4. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the `seen` set and continues to the next number in the array.
5. If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicate elements (i.e., without returning `True`), it returns `False`, indicating that no duplicate elements were found.

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly:

* If the input array contains duplicate elements, the function correctly returns `True`.
* If the input array does not contain any duplicate elements, the function correctly returns `False`.
* The function handles arrays of varying lengths and containing both positive and negative integers.
* The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, making it efficient for large inputs.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.
