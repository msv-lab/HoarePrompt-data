The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, which aligns with the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` successfully checks for duplicate integers in a given list and returns the expected boolean value. The output hints further reinforce this conclusion, highlighting the function's ability to handle various edge cases, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with multiple elements, both with and without duplicates.

The function's implementation, using a set to keep track of seen elements, ensures an efficient time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which is suitable for the task at hand. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in all possible cases.

The original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct is supported by the following reasons:

1. **Correct implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check for duplicate integers in a list.
2. **Efficient complexity**: The function's time and space complexity are suitable for the task.
3. **Edge case handling**: The function correctly handles various edge cases, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with multiple elements.
4. **Consistency with output hints**: The function's behavior is consistent with the output hints provided.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
