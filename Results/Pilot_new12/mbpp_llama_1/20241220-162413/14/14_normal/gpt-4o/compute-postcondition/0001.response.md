According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers and `seen` is an empty set. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one integer and `num` must be the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in the list**
