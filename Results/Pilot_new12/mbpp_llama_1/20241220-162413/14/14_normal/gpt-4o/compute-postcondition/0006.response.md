According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least two integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one integer, `seen` contains the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the first integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two integers, `seen` must contain the first integer in `arr`, and `num` must be the second integer in `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least two integers, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`**
