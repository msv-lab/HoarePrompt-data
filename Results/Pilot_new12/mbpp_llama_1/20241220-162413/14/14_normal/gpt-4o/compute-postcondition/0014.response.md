To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given code and the output states after executing a few times.

The loop iterates over each number `num` in the list `arr`. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is already in the set `seen`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found in `arr`. If `num` is not in `seen`, it is added to `seen`.

From the output states after executing the loop a few times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `arr` must have at least as many integers as the number of times the loop has executed.
2. `seen` contains all the unique integers encountered so far in `arr`.
3. `num` is the current integer being processed from `arr`.

However, the loop's execution can end in two ways:
- It completes iterating over all elements in `arr` without finding any duplicates.
- It finds a duplicate (i.e., `num` is already in `seen`) and returns `True`.

Considering these scenarios, let's determine the output state after all iterations have finished:

- If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, `seen` will contain all unique integers from `arr`, and `num` will be the last integer in `arr`.
- If the loop finds a duplicate and returns `True`, the function ends, and we don't consider the state after this point because the function has already terminated.

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations have finished (considering the loop completes without finding duplicates, as the function returns immediately if a duplicate is found) would be:

- `arr` is the original list of integers.
- `seen` contains all unique integers from `arr`.
- If the loop executed at least once, `num` would be the last integer in `arr`. However, since the loop might not execute at all if `arr` is empty, we must consider that case as well.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios, including the loop not executing (when `arr` is empty) and executing without finding duplicates, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from the original `arr`, and if `arr` is not empty, `num` is the last integer in `arr`.**
