To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least two integers.
- `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`.
- `num` is the second integer in `arr`.
- If `num` is in `seen`, the program returns True. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Given the code:
```python
seen.add(num)
```
This code adds `num` to the `seen` set.

The impact of this code on the program is that it modifies the `seen` set by adding `num` to it, regardless of whether `num` was already in `seen` or not. The states of `arr` and the condition regarding the return of True if `num` is in `seen` (before the addition) are not directly affected by this line of code. However, after adding `num` to `seen`, `num` will definitely be in `seen`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least two integers.
- `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr` and `num` (the second integer in `arr`).
- `num` is the second integer in `arr`.
- Since `num` is now in `seen`, if the program were to check the condition after this line, it would return True.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `seen` contains the first integer in `arr` and `num`, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and since `num` is in `seen`, the condition to return True is met.**
