Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks for duplicate integers in a given list `arr` and returns `True` if any duplicates are found, and `False` otherwise. The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. Upon execution, the function leaves the original list `arr` unchanged. It handles edge cases, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements, including those with and without duplicates. The function's return value indicates whether the input list contains any duplicate integers, providing a clear result for all possible input cases, including the edge cases of empty or single-element lists, where it correctly returns `False`.**
