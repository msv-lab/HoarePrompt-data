The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. The initial state is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least three integers, `seen` contains the first two integers in `arr`, and `num` is the third integer in `arr`. 

After the code is executed, `seen` will contain the first two integers in `arr` and `num` (the third integer in `arr`). The state of `arr` is not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three integers, `seen` contains the first three integers in `arr`, and `num` is the third integer in `arr`.**
