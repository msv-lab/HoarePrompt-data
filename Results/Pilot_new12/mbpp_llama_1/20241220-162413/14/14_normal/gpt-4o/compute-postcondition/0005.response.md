The value of `num` is added to the `seen` set. The `seen` set initially was empty, so now it contains the first integer in the list `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in the list `arr`, and `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the first integer in `arr`.**
