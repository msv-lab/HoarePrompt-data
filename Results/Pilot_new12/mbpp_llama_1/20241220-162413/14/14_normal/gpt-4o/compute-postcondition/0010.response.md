According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `num`. If `num` is not the last element in `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `seen` contains the first integer in `arr` and `num`, `num` is the second integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least three integers, `seen` must contain the first two integers in `arr`, and `num` must be the third integer in `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three integers, `seen` contains the first two integers in `arr`, and `num` is the third integer in `arr`**
