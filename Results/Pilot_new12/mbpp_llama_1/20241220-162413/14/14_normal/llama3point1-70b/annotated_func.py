#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if the list 'arr' contains any duplicate integers, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains any duplicate integers. The function returns `True` if the list contains at least one duplicate integer, and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements where all elements are unique or some elements are duplicated. The function does not modify the input list in any way, and its sole purpose is to check for the presence of duplicate integers. If the input list is not empty and contains at least one integer, the function will correctly identify the presence or absence of duplicates. If the input list is empty, the function will return `False` since there are no elements to compare.
