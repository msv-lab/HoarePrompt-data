You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))


```
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains any duplicate integers. The function returns `True` if the list contains at least one duplicate integer, and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements where all elements are unique or some elements are duplicated. The function does not modify the input list in any way, and its sole purpose is to check for the presence of duplicate integers. If the input list is not empty and contains at least one integer, the function will correctly identify the presence or absence of duplicates. If the input list is empty, the function will return `False` since there are no elements to compare.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
