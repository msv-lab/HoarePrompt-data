Correctness: **True**

The program checks if the length of the input array is equal to the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, if the array contains any duplicate elements, the length of the set will be less than the length of the array, and the function will return `True`, indicating that there are duplicates. If the array does not contain any duplicates, the lengths of the array and the set will be equal, and the function will return `False`.

This solution correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty list: The function will return `False`, which is correct since there are no elements to compare.
- A list with a single element: The function will return `False`, which is correct since there are no duplicates.
- A list with multiple elements where all elements are unique: The function will return `False`, which is correct since there are no duplicates.
- A list with multiple elements where some elements are duplicated: The function will return `True`, which is correct since there are duplicates.

The function does not modify the input list in any way, and its sole purpose is to check for the presence of duplicate integers, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality, and no edge cases are mentioned that the code does not handle correctly. Assuming the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the code accurately solves the problem as described.
