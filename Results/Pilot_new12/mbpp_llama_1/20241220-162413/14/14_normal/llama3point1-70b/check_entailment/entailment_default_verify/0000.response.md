Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(arr)` correctly checks for duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the original array to the length of a set created from the array. This approach handles all potential cases, including empty arrays, arrays with a single element, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with all unique elements.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, returning `True` if the list contains at least one duplicate integer, and `False` otherwise. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the input list in any way, which is consistent with the provided code.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements where all elements are unique or some elements are duplicated. The assessment also notes that the function works correctly for arrays containing negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

Given that the function handles these cases correctly, and the output hints confirm its behavior, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
