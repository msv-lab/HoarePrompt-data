Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks if an array of integers contains any duplicate element by comparing the length of the original array to the length of a set created from the array. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, so if there are any duplicate integers in the array, they will be removed in the set, resulting in a difference in length between the two. 

The output hints agree with the code and they also help confirm that the code is correct. The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements where all elements are unique or some elements are duplicated.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `False` because there are no duplicates. If the input array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `True` because there is a duplicate element `2`.

The code does not modify the input list in any way and its sole purpose is to check for the presence of duplicate integers, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
