Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it effectively checks for duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from the array. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in the array are automatically removed in the set. 

If the lengths of the array and the set are not equal, it means there were duplicate elements in the array, and the function returns True. If the lengths are equal, it means all elements in the array are unique, and the function returns False. 

This approach works for all potential cases, including empty arrays, arrays with a single element, arrays with all elements being the same, and arrays with a mix of unique and duplicate elements. It also handles negative numbers and zero correctly, as these are just treated as regular integers in the set. 

Therefore, without being able to find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
