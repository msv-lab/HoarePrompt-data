You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if the list 'arr' contains any duplicate integers, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains any duplicate integers. The function returns `True` if the list contains at least one duplicate integer, and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements where all elements are unique or some elements are duplicated. The function does not modify the input list in any way, and its sole purpose is to check for the presence of duplicate integers. If the input list is not empty and contains at least one integer, the function will correctly identify the presence or absence of duplicates. If the input list is empty, the function will return `False` since there are no elements to compare.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
