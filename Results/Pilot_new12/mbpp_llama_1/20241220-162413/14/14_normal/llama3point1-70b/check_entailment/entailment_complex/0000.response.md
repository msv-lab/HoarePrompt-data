Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains any duplicate integers.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The program converts the input list `arr` to a set using `set(arr)`. This automatically removes any duplicate integers because sets in Python only store unique elements.
2. The program then compares the length of the original list `arr` to the length of the set using `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))`. If the lengths are not equal, it means that there were duplicate integers in the original list.
3. The program returns `True` if the lengths are not equal (i.e., there are duplicates) and `False` otherwise.

This approach correctly handles all cases, including:

* An empty list: In this case, `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` will both be 0, so the function will return `False`, which is correct because an empty list does not contain any duplicate integers.
* A list with a single element: In this case, `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` will both be 1, so the function will return `False`, which is correct because a list with a single element does not contain any duplicate integers.
* A list with multiple elements where all elements are unique: In this case, `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` will be equal, so the function will return `False`, which is correct because there are no duplicate integers in this case.
* A list with multiple elements where some elements are duplicated: In this case, `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` will not be equal, so the function will return `True`, which is correct because there are duplicate integers in this case.

Overall, the program correctly identifies the presence or absence of duplicate integers in the input list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.
