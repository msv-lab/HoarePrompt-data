Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(arr)` checks for duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the original array to the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, if the array contains any duplicate elements, the length of the set will be less than the length of the array, and the function will correctly return `True`. If the array does not contain any duplicates, the lengths will be equal, and the function will correctly return `False`.

This approach handles all potential cases, including empty arrays, arrays with a single element, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with all unique elements. It also works correctly for arrays containing negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers, as well as for arrays with a mix of different data types, although the problem description specifically mentions integers.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False` because there are no duplicates.
* `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])` returns `True` because there is a duplicate.
* `func_1([])` returns `False` because an empty array does not contain any duplicates.
* `func_1([5])` returns `False` because a single-element array does not contain any duplicates.
* `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1])` returns `True` because all elements are duplicates.

Given that the function handles these and other potential cases correctly, it is considered correct according to the problem description.
