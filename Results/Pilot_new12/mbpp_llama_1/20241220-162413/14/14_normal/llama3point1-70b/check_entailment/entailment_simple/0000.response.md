Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description, which asks to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.

Here's why it's correct:

* The function takes an array (list in Python) `arr` as input and returns a boolean value.
* The expression `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` is the core of the function. It works as follows:
  * `set(arr)` converts the input list `arr` to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets in Python only store unique elements.
  * `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` calculate the number of elements in the original list and the set, respectively.
  * If there are any duplicates in the original list, the length of the set will be less than the length of the list, because duplicates are removed in the set. Therefore, `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` will be `True`.
  * If there are no duplicates, the lengths will be equal, and `len(arr)!= len(set(arr))` will be `False`.
* The function returns this boolean value, indicating whether the input list contains any duplicate integers.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to detect duplicates based on the difference in lengths between the original list and the set, it meets the problem description for all potential cases, assuming valid input is provided as per the problem statement.
