Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The function handles tuples of any length and strings of any length, including empty strings. If an empty string is encountered, the function will throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as there is no last character to access. For non-empty strings, the function will correctly return the last character. The function assumes that all elements in the tuple are strings, and it does not perform any error checking for non-string elements. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as the operation is not defined for non-string types. The function does not modify the input tuple and returns a new list object.**
