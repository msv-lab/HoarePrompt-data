Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` is used to achieve this. Here's how it works:

- `tup` is the input tuple containing strings.
- `s` is each string in the tuple.
- `s[-1]` is used to get the last character of each string. In Python, negative indices start from the end of the string, so `-1` refers to the last character.

The function then returns a list of these last characters, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']`, demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple and returns them in a list, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
