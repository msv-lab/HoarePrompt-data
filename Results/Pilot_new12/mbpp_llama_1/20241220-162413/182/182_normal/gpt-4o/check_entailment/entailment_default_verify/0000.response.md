The original assessment seems to be mostly accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program uses a list comprehension to extract the last character of each string in the given tuple, which is a correct and efficient approach. The output hints also support this assessment, as they state that the function correctly returns the last character of each string in the tuple.

However, the output hints do mention a few potential issues that the original assessment does not address. Specifically, they state that the function will throw an exception when trying to access the last character of an empty string, and that it does not perform any error checking for non-string elements in the tuple. 

Despite these potential issues, the problem description does not specify how the function should handle empty strings or non-string elements. It simply states that the function should extract the last character of each string in the tuple. 

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function can be considered correct. The function does not have any responsibility to handle invalid inputs or edge cases if they are not specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**. 

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the problem description and the output hints are consistent with the program's functionality. The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple, which is the required behavior. The potential issues mentioned in the output hints are not relevant given the assumption that the input will be valid.
