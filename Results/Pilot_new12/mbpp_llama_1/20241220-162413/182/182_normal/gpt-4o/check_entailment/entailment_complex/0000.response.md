Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. 

The line `return [s[-1] for s in tup]` is a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and extracts the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. This last character is then included in the resulting list.

Given the assumptions provided, such as valid input and no error handling required for non-string elements or empty strings, the function will always return the last character of each string in the tuple, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function's operation is also confirmed by the provided assertions, showing its correctness for different inputs. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the assumptions made about the input, the program is correct and always does what the problem description requires.
