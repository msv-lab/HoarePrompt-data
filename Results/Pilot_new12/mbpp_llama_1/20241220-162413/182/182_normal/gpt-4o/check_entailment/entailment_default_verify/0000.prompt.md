You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program uses a list comprehension to extract the last character of each string in the given tuple. The `s[-1]` expression is a Pythonic way to access the last element of a sequence (in this case, a string). This approach is concise and efficient.

The program works as expected for all possible inputs, including tuples containing strings of varying lengths. It also handles cases where the input tuple contains only one string, or where the strings are empty (although this is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions).

To see why this program is correct, consider the following:

- The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
- For each string, `s[-1]` returns the last character of the string.
- The resulting characters are collected into a list, which is then returned by the function.

Since the program uses a list comprehension and the `s[-1]` expression, it is both efficient and easy to read. There are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, and the provided assertions suggest that the program works as expected for a variety of inputs.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, it appears that the program is correct and will work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The function handles tuples of any length and strings of any length, including empty strings. If an empty string is encountered, the function will throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as there is no last character to access. For non-empty strings, the function will correctly return the last character. The function assumes that all elements in the tuple are strings, and it does not perform any error checking for non-string elements. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as the operation is not defined for non-string types. The function does not modify the input tuple and returns a new list object.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
