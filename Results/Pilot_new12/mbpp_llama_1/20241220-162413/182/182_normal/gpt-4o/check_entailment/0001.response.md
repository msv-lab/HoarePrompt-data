Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the rear index elements of each string. The rear index element is the last character of each string, which is accessed using the index `[-1]`.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the strings in the tuple and extract the last character of each string. The resulting list of characters is then returned by the function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program by checking its output for different inputs. For example, the first unit test checks that the function returns `['s', 'r', 's']` when given the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, which is the correct output.

The program correctly handles strings of any length and does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle. It also does not have any missing logic that would cause it to fail for certain inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple and returns it as a list of characters.
