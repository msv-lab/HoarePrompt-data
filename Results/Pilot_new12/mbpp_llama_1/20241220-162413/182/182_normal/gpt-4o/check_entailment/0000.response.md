Correctness: **True**

The provided program uses a list comprehension to extract the last character of each string in the given tuple. The `s[-1]` expression is a Pythonic way to access the last element of a sequence (in this case, a string). This approach is concise and efficient.

The program works as expected for all possible inputs, including tuples containing strings of varying lengths. It also handles cases where the input tuple contains only one string, or where the strings are empty (although this is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions).

To see why this program is correct, consider the following:

- The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
- For each string, `s[-1]` returns the last character of the string.
- The resulting characters are collected into a list, which is then returned by the function.

Since the program uses a list comprehension and the `s[-1]` expression, it is both efficient and easy to read. There are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, and the provided assertions suggest that the program works as expected for a variety of inputs.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, it appears that the program is correct and will work as expected for all possible inputs.
