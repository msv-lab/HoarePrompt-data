Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple and returns a list containing these characters. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` ensures that for each string `s` in the tuple `tup`, the last character is accessed and added to the list.

The code handles tuples of any length and strings of any length, including non-empty strings. The problem description does not explicitly mention handling empty strings or non-string elements in the tuple, and it is assumed that the input will be valid (i.e., the tuple will only contain non-empty strings). Under these assumptions, the code behaves as expected and correctly returns the last character of each string in the tuple.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs. The output hints also align with the code's behavior, indicating that the function will correctly return the last character of each string in the tuple, assuming all elements are non-empty strings.
