Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns the last character `s[-1]`. 

The function handles tuples of any length and strings of any length. Although the output hints mention that the function will throw an exception when trying to access the last character of an empty string, this does not affect the correctness of the function because we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']` checks that the function correctly returns the last characters of each string in the tuple. 

Overall, the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
