Based on the provided code, the problem description, and the annotated version, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The problem description requires a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The provided code implements a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the rear index elements of each string.

The original assessment claims that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code.

The annotated code provides additional insights into the program's behavior. The annotation before the function call states that `tup` is a tuple containing strings. This annotation is consistent with the problem description, which specifies that the input is a tuple of strings.

The annotation after the function call states that the program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple `tup`. This annotation is also consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

Given that the annotations support the original assessment, and considering that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., a non-empty tuple of non-empty strings), I conclude that the program is correct.

The original assessment is accurate because:

1. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the input tuple.
2. The function returns the extracted characters as a list, which meets the problem description.
3. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the original assessment, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
