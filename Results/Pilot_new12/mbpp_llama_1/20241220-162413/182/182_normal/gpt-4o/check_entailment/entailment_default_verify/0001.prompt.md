You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the rear index elements of each string. The rear index element is the last character of each string, which is accessed using the index `[-1]`.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the strings in the tuple and extract the last character of each string. The resulting list of characters is then returned by the function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program by checking its output for different inputs. For example, the first unit test checks that the function returns `['s', 'r', 's']` when given the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, which is the correct output.

The program correctly handles strings of any length and does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle. It also does not have any missing logic that would cause it to fail for certain inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple and returns it as a list of characters.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The function handles tuples of any length and strings of any length, including empty strings. If an empty string is encountered, the function will throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as there is no last character to access. For non-empty strings, the function will correctly return the last character. The function assumes that all elements in the tuple are strings, and it does not perform any error checking for non-string elements. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may throw an exception when trying to access the last character, as the operation is not defined for non-string types. The function does not modify the input tuple and returns a new list object.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
