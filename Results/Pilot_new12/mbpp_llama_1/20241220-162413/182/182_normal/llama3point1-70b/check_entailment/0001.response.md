Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters where each character is the last element of the corresponding string in the input tuple. This is achieved using a list comprehension with `s[-1]`, which is a Pythonic way to get the last element of a sequence.

This function correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. If the input is a tuple of strings, it will extract the rear index element (last character) of each string and return them in a list. It handles empty strings by raising an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, which might be considered correct behavior depending on the context, as the problem description doesn't explicitly mention how to handle empty strings. However, the function works as expected for all non-empty strings.

To ensure the code works for all potential cases, consider the following examples:
- When all strings in the tuple are non-empty, the function returns the last character of each string.
- When the tuple contains only one string, the function returns a list with the last character of that string.
- The function can handle strings of any length (including single-character strings) and returns the last character of each.

Given these examples and the nature of the code, it seems to correctly implement the described functionality without any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail, assuming that raising an exception for empty strings is acceptable or that the input will always be non-empty strings.
