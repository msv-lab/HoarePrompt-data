Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully align with the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the problem description mentions extracting only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, but it does not explicitly handle the case when one of the strings in the tuple is empty. The provided output hints, which agree with the code's behavior, indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. This exception is due to attempting to access the last character of an empty string using `s[-1]`. Thus, the code does not meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs, specifically when dealing with empty strings within the tuple. 

To align with the problem description and handle all potential cases correctly, the code should include a mechanism to handle empty strings, such as returning a specific value or skipping them without raising an exception, depending on the intended behavior defined in the problem description. For example, it could return a list of `None` or a special character for empty strings, or it could filter out empty strings from the result. Without such handling, the code does not meet the criteria for all possible cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect as per the given problem description and output hints.
