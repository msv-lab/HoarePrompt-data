Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` is a concise and efficient way to achieve this.

The `-1` index in Python refers to the last element of a sequence, so `s[-1]` correctly extracts the last character of each string `s`. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, in which case `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description asks for the "rear index element" of each string, it is assumed that the input strings are non-empty.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input, which means it assumes that the input will always be a tuple of non-empty strings. If the input is not a tuple, or if the tuple contains non-string elements, or if any of the strings are empty, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results. However, based on the problem description, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be valid.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for any valid input. It correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple and returns them as a list.
