Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

* The problem description asks to extract only the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the tuple.
* The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`.
* For each string `s`, it uses the indexing syntax `s[-1]` to extract the last character of the string.
* The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description and will produce the expected output for any valid input tuple of strings. 

Example: 

If the input tuple is `("hello", "world", "python")`, the function will return `['o', 'd', 'n']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
