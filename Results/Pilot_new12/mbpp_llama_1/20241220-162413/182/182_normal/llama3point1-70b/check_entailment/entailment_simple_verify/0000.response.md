Based on the provided problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The provided code, `func_1`, takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string using the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`. The `-1` index in Python refers to the last element of a sequence, so `s[-1]` correctly extracts the last character of each string `s`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function is working as intended. The state of the program right before the function call is that `strings` is a tuple of strings, and the program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `strings`. This matches the expected output according to the problem description.

The original assessment mentions that the function does not perform any error checking on the input, but since we assume that the input will always be valid, this is not a concern. The assessment also mentions that the function will raise an `IndexError` if any of the strings are empty, but again, we assume that the input will always be valid, so this is not a problem.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
