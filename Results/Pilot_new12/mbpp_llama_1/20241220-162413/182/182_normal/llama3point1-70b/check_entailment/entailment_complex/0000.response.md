Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and returns the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. This directly corresponds to the requirement of extracting the rear index element (last character) of each string in the tuple.

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input tuple might be empty or where the strings within the tuple might be empty, as these scenarios are explicitly mentioned as being handled in the comments, even though they might result in an exception or an empty list return, respectively.

Given valid input (a tuple of non-empty strings), the function will return a list of the last characters of each string, perfectly matching the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct as per the provided problem description and assumptions.
