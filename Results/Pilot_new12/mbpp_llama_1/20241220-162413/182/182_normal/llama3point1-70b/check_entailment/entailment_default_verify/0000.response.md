Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` does indeed extract the last character of each string in the input tuple and returns them as a list. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple.

The output hints also mention that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. However, as stated in the original assessment, it is assumed that the input strings are non-empty, since the problem description asks for the "rear index element" of each string. This assumption is also confirmed by the output hints, which state that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, given the assumptions about the input and the problem description, the original assessment remains accurate. The function is correct in the context of the problem description and the provided output hints.

Final: **True**
