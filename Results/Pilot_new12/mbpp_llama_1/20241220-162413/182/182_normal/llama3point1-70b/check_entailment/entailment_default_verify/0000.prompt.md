You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` is a concise and efficient way to achieve this.

The `-1` index in Python refers to the last element of a sequence, so `s[-1]` correctly extracts the last character of each string `s`. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, in which case `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description asks for the "rear index element" of each string, it is assumed that the input strings are non-empty.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input, which means it assumes that the input will always be a tuple of non-empty strings. If the input is not a tuple, or if the tuple contains non-string elements, or if any of the strings are empty, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results. However, based on the problem description, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be valid.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for any valid input. It correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple and returns them as a list.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, because it attempts to access the last character of the string using `s[-1]`. The function does not modify the input tuple or its contents in any way. The returned list will have the same number of elements as the input tuple, with each element being a single character.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
