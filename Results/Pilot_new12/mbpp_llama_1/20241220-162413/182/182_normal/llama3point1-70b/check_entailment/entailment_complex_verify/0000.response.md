Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string, which meets the problem description.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment, as it describes the state of the program before the function call and the expected return value. The annotation mentions that if the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list, and if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will always be valid, so we can disregard the case where the input tuple or any string in it is empty.

The original assessment notes that the function does not perform any error checking on the input, but since we assume the input will always be valid, this is not a concern. The function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple and returns them as a list, as described in the problem description.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and based on the annotated version and my reasoning, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
