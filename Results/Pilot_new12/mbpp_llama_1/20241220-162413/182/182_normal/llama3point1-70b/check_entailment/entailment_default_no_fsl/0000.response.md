Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when any string in the tuple is empty. In this case, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, because it attempts to access the last character of the string using `s[-1]`. The problem description does not state that the function should raise an exception in this case. 

However, it is worth noting that this issue could be considered valid if the problem description explicitly stated that the input strings are non-empty, as it is common to assume that input will be valid. But since such an assumption is not explicitly stated in the problem description, we consider this case as a potential issue with the code.

Also it should be noted that this code will work correctly assuming that all strings are not empty. The issue arises from the potential presence of empty strings in the tuple. If we knew for certain that there would never be any empty strings in the input, the code would work as expected and would return the last character of each string.
