#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple 'strings'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, because it attempts to access the last character of the string using `s[-1]`. The function does not modify the input tuple or its contents in any way. The returned list will have the same number of elements as the input tuple, with each element being a single character.
