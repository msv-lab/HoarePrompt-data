Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem asks to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string, which implies that the characters at even indices should be kept.

The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and include only the characters at even indices (0-based indexing). The expression `i % 2 == 0` is used to filter out the characters at odd indices. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string using the `join` method.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function works as expected. For example, when the input string is `'abcdef'`, the function returns `'ace'`, which are the characters at even indices (0, 2, and 4).

In general, the program will always return a string that consists of the characters from the input string that are at even indices, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the program is correct.
