Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the characters at odd index values from a given string. In Python, indexing starts at 0, which means the first character is at index 0 (even) and the second character is at index 1 (odd). The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only the characters where the index is even (`i % 2 == 0`).

This approach correctly filters out the characters at odd index values, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. For example, when the input is `'abcdef'`, the function returns `'ace'`, which are the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4). This logic is consistently applied across all the test cases, and there's no apparent edge case that the function does not handle correctly.

Given the nature of the task and the implementation, the function should work as expected for any input string, as the logic of selecting characters based on even index values is universally applicable. Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for the provided test cases and, based on its logic, should continue to do so for any string input, it is considered correct.
