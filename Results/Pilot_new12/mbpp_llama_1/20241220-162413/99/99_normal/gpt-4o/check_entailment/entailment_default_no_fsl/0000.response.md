Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a Python function `func_1` that removes characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string, selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and joining them into a new string. 

This implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. The code handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices. It assumes the input will always be a string, as specified in the problem description and output hints.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input strings, including 'abcdef', 'python', 'data', and 'lambs'. The output hints further clarify the function's behavior, stating that it filters out characters at odd indices and returns a new string.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and handles all specified cases, and there are no examples or edge cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is **True**.
