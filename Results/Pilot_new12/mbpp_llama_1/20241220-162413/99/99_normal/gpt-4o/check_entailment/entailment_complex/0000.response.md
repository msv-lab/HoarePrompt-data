Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to remove characters at odd index values from a given string, which is equivalent to keeping characters at even index values. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this by using list comprehension to select characters from the input string `s` where the index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). This results in a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing).

The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, correctly. For example, given the input string `'abcdef'`, the function returns `'ace'`, which are the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4). This matches the expected behavior described in the problem description.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'` and `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, further demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different input strings.

Since the problem description specifies that the input will always be a valid string, the function's assumption that the input will always be a string does not introduce any incorrectness. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the annotated program, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
