Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that removes characters at odd index values from a given string. The provided function `func_1(s)` does exactly this by using a generator expression to iterate over the characters at even indices of the string `s` and joining them into a new string.

The key line of code is `return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))`, which ensures that only characters at indices that are multiples of 2 (i.e., even indices) are included in the resulting string. This effectively filters out characters at odd indices, preserving the original order of characters at even indices.

Since the function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, by returning an empty string in such cases, and does not modify the original string `s`, it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
