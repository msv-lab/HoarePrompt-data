Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` appears to correctly implement the problem description, which is to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the string `s`, but only includes characters at even indices (i.e., `i` values that are multiples of 2) in the new string.

The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, correctly by returning an empty string in such cases. The original string `s` is not modified, and the function preserves the original order of characters at even indices.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and provide examples of the function's behavior. Since the function correctly implements the problem description for every potential case, and no edge cases are missed, the correctness of the program is True. 

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the function will return "ace", which is the expected output. If the input string is "abc", the function will return "ac", which is also correct. The function also correctly handles empty strings by returning an empty string, and it preserves the original order of characters at even indices. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, the program correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
