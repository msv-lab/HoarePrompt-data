The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints. The function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove characters with odd index values from a given string `s`, and it achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate over the string `s` and select characters at even indexes. The output hints support this functionality, stating that the function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices of `s`, without modifying the original string `s`.

The code correctly implements the required functionality, as indicated by the following points:
1. **Correct Indexing**: The function uses `range(0, len(s), 2)` to generate indices, which selects characters at even indices (0-based indexing).
2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))` effectively filters out characters at odd indices, preserving the original order of characters at even indices.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, by returning an empty string in such cases, as demonstrated by the output hints.

Given that the program aligns with the problem description and the output hints validate its behavior, the original assessment of correctness remains valid. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided information.

Final: **True**
