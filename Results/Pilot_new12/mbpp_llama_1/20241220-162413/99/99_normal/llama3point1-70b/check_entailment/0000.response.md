Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1(s)`, is designed to remove characters with odd index values from a given string `s`. In Python, indexing starts at 0, which means that even indexes are 0, 2, 4, etc., and odd indexes are 1, 3, 5, etc.

The function uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string `s` and select characters at even indexes. The expression `(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))` generates characters from `s` where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `s` in steps of 2, effectively selecting characters at even indexes (0, 2, 4,...).

For example, if `s = "abcdef"`, the function will return `"ace"`, which are the characters at even indexes (0: 'a', 2: 'c', 4: 'e').

This logic is correct for removing characters at odd indexes from any given string, regardless of the string's length or content. Therefore, the program works as described for every potential case.
