The problem description requires the function to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so even indices correspond to the characters at positions 0, 2, 4, and so on, while odd indices correspond to the characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and so on.

The provided function `func_1(s)` uses a generator expression within the `''.join()` method to iterate over the characters in the string `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to the length of the string `s`, stepping by 2 each time. This means it selects the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and joins them together into a new string.

Given this explanation, we can conclude that the function `func_1(s)` does exactly what the problem description asks for: it removes the characters at odd indices from the string `s` by only selecting and joining the characters at even indices.

Correctness: **True**
