Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. In Python, indexing starts at 0, which is considered an even index. The function uses a generator expression within the `join()` method to iterate over the string `s`, but it only includes characters where the index `i` is even (i.e., `range(0, len(s), 2)`).

Here's a breakdown of why the function works as expected:

- It iterates over the indices of `s` starting from 0 and stepping by 2, effectively selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4,...).
- The expression `s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)` generates a sequence of characters from `s` where each character's index in `s` is even.
- `''.join(...)` concatenates these characters into a single string, effectively creating a new string that includes only the characters from `s` that have even index values.

Given the problem description's requirement to remove characters at odd index values (leaving only characters at even indices), the function correctly implements this logic. It does not include any characters where the index would be odd (1, 3, 5,...), thus effectively "removing" them from the resulting string.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, and no examples of incorrect behavior can be found.
