The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices of `s`. It does not modify the original string `s` and handles strings of any length, including empty strings, by returning an empty string in such cases. The function effectively filters out characters at odd indices, preserving the original order of characters at even indices.
