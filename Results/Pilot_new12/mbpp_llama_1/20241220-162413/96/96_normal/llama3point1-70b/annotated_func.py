#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in tuple 'tup' are of the same type, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if all elements within a given tuple are of the same data type. It accepts a tuple as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the types of all elements in the tuple are uniform (True) or diverse (False). This includes handling edge cases such as an empty tuple, where the function will return True, as there are no elements of differing types. The function covers all potential cases, including tuples containing elements of any data type, and provides a clear boolean outcome based on the type uniformity of the tuple's elements.
