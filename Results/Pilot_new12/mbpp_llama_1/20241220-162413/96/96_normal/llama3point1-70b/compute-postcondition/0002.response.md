Functionality: **The function determines if all elements within a given tuple are of the same data type. It accepts a tuple as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the types of all elements in the tuple are uniform (True) or diverse (False). This includes handling edge cases such as an empty tuple, where the function will return True, as there are no elements of differing types. The function covers all potential cases, including tuples containing elements of any data type, and provides a clear boolean outcome based on the type uniformity of the tuple's elements.**
