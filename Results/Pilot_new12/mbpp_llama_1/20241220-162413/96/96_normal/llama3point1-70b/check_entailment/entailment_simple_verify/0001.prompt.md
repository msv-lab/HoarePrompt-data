You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function uses a set to store the types of all elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one type, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `(type(x) for x in tup)`: This is a generator expression that iterates over each element `x` in the tuple `tup` and returns its type.
2. `set(...)`: This converts the generator expression into a set, which automatically removes any duplicates.
3. `len(...) == 1`: This checks if the set contains only one element. If it does, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`, which may seem counterintuitive. However, according to the problem description, the function should check if all elements have the same type, and in an empty tuple, there are no elements, so there are no different types.
* If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.
* If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.

I have not found any potential case that the program does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in tuple 'tup' are of the same type, False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
