The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe this assessment remains accurate.

The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same type by using a set to store the types of all elements. The function returns `True` if all elements have the same type (i.e., the set contains only one type) and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

The annotated version also mentions edge cases, such as an empty tuple, where the function will return `True`. This is consistent with the original assessment, which notes that an empty tuple should return `True` because there are no elements of differing types.

The function covers all potential cases, including tuples containing elements of any data type, and provides a clear boolean outcome based on the type uniformity of the tuple's elements. The annotated version reinforces this conclusion and does not introduce any new information that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
