Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function uses a set to store the types of all elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one type, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `(type(x) for x in tup)`: This is a generator expression that iterates over each element `x` in the tuple `tup` and returns its type.
2. `set(...)`: This converts the generator expression into a set, which automatically removes any duplicates.
3. `len(...) == 1`: This checks if the set contains only one element. If it does, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`, which may seem counterintuitive. However, according to the problem description, the function should check if all elements have the same type, and in an empty tuple, there are no elements, so there are no different types.
* If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.
* If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.

I have not found any potential case that the program does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
