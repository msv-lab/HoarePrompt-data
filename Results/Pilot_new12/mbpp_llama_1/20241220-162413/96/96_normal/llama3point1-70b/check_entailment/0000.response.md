Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(tup)` correctly checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

- It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple.
- These types are then added to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning that if there are multiple occurrences of the same type, they will only appear once in the set.
- The function then checks if the length of this set is 1, i.e., `len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1`. If the length is 1, it means all elements have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any size and with elements of any data type. It correctly identifies when all elements have the same type and when they do not.

For example, `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `True` because all elements are integers, and `func_1((1, '2', 3))` returns `False` because the elements have different types (integer and string).

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases (tuples with elements of the same type, tuples with elements of different types, tuples of any size), the correctness of the function is True.
