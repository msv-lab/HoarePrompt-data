The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup`. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. If all elements in `tup` are of the same type, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, and a tuple with multiple elements of different types. After executing the function, the state of the program will be one of two possible outcomes: the function will have returned `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, or it will have returned `False` if the tuple contains elements of different types. The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` in any way, it only checks its contents and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements are of the same type.
