Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by first checking if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns True. Then it checks the type of the first element and compares it with the type of each subsequent element in the tuple. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns False. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different type, it returns True.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty tuple: It returns True, as there are no elements with different types.
- A tuple with elements of the same type: It returns True, as all elements have the same type.
- A tuple with elements of different types: It returns False, as there are elements with different types.
- Tuples containing elements of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, etc.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` behaves as expected for all the test cases, returning True for tuples with elements of the same type and False for tuples with elements of different types.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
