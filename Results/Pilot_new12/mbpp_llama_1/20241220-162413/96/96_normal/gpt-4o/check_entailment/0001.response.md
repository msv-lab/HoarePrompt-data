Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the problem description. It checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` works by first checking if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True` because there are no elements to compare. Then, it determines the data type of the first element and checks each subsequent element to ensure they all match the same data type. If it finds an element with a different data type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different data type, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly handles all potential cases:

- An empty tuple is considered to have all elements of the same type (vacuously true), and the function returns `True`.
- A tuple with all elements of the same type returns `True`.
- A tuple with elements of different types returns `False`.

The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they cover various scenarios and the function behaves as expected. Without being able to find a counterexample where the function does not work as described, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential inputs and edge cases.
