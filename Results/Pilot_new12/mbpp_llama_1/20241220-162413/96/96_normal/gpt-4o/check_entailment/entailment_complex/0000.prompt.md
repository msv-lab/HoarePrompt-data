You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: tup is a tuple, and tup is not empty
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, and either the function has returned `False` (indicating a type mismatch) or all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type` and `element` is the last element of `tup`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`, where `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]` and `tup` is a non-empty tuple
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup`. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. If all elements in `tup` are of the same type, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, and a tuple with multiple elements of different types. After executing the function, the state of the program will be one of two possible outcomes: the function will have returned `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, or it will have returned `False` if the tuple contains elements of different types. The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` in any way, it only checks its contents and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements are of the same type.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
