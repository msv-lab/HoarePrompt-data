Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks if all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup`. It handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, and a tuple with multiple elements of different types. 

The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the tuple and checks its type against the type of the first element. If it encounters an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements with different types, it returns `True`. 

In the case where the tuple is empty, the function returns `True` as there are no elements to compare.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various cases. For example, `assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True` checks the case where all elements are of the same type, `assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False` checks the case where elements are of different types, and `assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True` checks another case where all elements are of the same type.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly handles all potential cases and returns the expected results.
