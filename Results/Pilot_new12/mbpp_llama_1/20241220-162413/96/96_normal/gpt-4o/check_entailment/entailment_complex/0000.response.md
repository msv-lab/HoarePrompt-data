Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same data type as the first element in `tup`. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. **Empty tuple handling:** If `tup` is empty, the function returns `True`, which aligns with the problem description. An empty tuple by definition has no elements, so it's correct to consider all elements (none in this case) as having the same data type.

2. **Single element tuple handling:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the function correctly handles tuples with a single element by returning `True`, since a single element tuple has all its elements (i.e., one) of the same type.

3. **Multiple elements tuple handling:** The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in `tup`. If it finds an element with a type that differs from the type of the first element (`first_type`), it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all elements are of the same data type.

4. **No type mismatches:** If the function completes the for loop without finding any type mismatches, it returns `True`, correctly indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same data type.

The provided assertions (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios, further supporting the correctness of the program. 

Overall, the function correctly implements the logic to check if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type, aligning with the problem description and making it correct for all potential valid inputs.
