Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same type. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, and a tuple with multiple elements of different types. 

The function first checks if the tuple `tup` is empty, in which case it immediately returns `True`, as there are no elements to compare. 

Then it gets the type of the first element in the tuple and compares it with the type of each subsequent element. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. 

If it checks all elements and finds that they all have the same type as the first element, it returns `True`. 

The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` in any way, it only checks its contents and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements are of the same type.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function, as they cover different cases such as tuples with elements of the same type, tuples with elements of different types, and an empty tuple.

The output hints also agree with the code, they describe the function's behavior correctly, and they do not reveal any potential edge cases that the code does not handle. 

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description, and there are no potential cases where it would not work as expected.
