Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not.

Here's why it works:

1. **Handling empty tuple**: The function first checks if the input tuple `tup` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements (none, in this case) have the same data type, which is a valid interpretation.

2. **Checking data types**: If the tuple is not empty, it stores the data type of the first element in `first_type`. Then, it iterates over each element in the tuple, checking if the data type of the current element matches `first_type`. If a mismatch is found, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all elements have the same data type.

3. **Reporting uniform data type**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same data type as the first element (`first_type`).

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function:

- `assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`: All elements are integers, so it returns `True`.
- `assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`: The tuple contains integers and a string, so it returns `False`.
- `assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`: All elements are integers, so it returns `True`.

Overall, the function correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, making it correct for all potential input cases, given the assumption of valid input.
