The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on the elements in `tup`. Specifically, it checks if all elements in `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup`. If `tup` is a non-empty tuple and all elements are of the same type as the first element, it returns `True`. For all other cases, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return `True` if all elements in `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup` and `tup` is not empty, otherwise it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup`, returns `True` if all elements in `tup` are of the same type as the first element in `tup` and `tup` is not empty, otherwise it returns `False`.**
