According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 2 elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the second element of `tup`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `tup` must have at least 3 elements and `element` is the third element of `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least three elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the third element of `tup`**
