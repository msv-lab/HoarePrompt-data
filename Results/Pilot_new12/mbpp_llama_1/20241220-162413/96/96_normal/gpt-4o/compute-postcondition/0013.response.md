Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least three elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the third element of `tup`. If the type of `element` is not equal to `first_type`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made, maintaining the original state.***
