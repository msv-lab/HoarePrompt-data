The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and based on the problem description and the provided code, this assessment makes sense. The function `func_1(s)` indeed checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and comparing its length to 1. This approach correctly handles various cases, including empty strings, strings with a single character, strings with multiple different characters, and strings with all characters being the same.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by describing the state of the program before the function call and the return value of the function. The annotation indicates that the function returns `True` if the string contains only the same characters and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description.

Given that the original assessment is based on a thorough analysis of the function's behavior and the annotated version provides additional confirmation, there is no reason to change the original assessment. The function works as expected and meets the problem description.

Final: **True**
