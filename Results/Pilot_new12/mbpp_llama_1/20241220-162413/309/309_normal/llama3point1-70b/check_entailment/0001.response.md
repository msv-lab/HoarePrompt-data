Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate characters, and if all characters are the same, the length of the set will be 1.

Here's why this function works correctly:

1. **Handling strings with same characters**: If all characters in the string are the same (e.g., "aaa"), the `set` function will return a set containing only one unique character, and the length of the set will be 1, correctly returning `True`.

2. **Handling strings with different characters**: If the string contains different characters (e.g., "abc"), the `set` function will return a set containing multiple unique characters, and the length of the set will be greater than 1, correctly returning `False`.

3. **Handling empty strings**: If an empty string is passed to the function (e.g., ""), the `set` function will return an empty set, and the length of the set will be 0, correctly returning `False` in the context that "all characters are the same" implies there are characters to compare.

4. **Handling strings with a single character**: If a string with a single character is passed to the function (e.g., "a"), the `set` function will return a set containing that one character, and the length of the set will be 1, correctly returning `True` because, by definition, all characters in a string of length 1 are the same.

Since the function behaves correctly for all these potential cases and there's no apparent edge case it fails to handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct based on the provided problem description.
