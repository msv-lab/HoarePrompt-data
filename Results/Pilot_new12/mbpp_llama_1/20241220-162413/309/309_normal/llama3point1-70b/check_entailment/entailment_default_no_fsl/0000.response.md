Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is equal to 1. This approach works because a set in Python only contains unique elements. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one element, thus having a length of 1.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

1. **Empty strings**: An empty string will be converted into an empty set, which has a length of 0, so the function will return `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same (which is technically correct since there are no characters).

2. **Strings with a single character**: A string with one character will be converted into a set with one character, so the function will return `True`, indicating that all characters are the same.

3. **Strings with multiple identical characters**: A string with multiple characters that are all the same will be converted into a set with one character, so the function will return `True`.

4. **Strings with different characters**: A string with multiple different characters will be converted into a set with more than one character, so the function will return `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case, assuming that the input will always be a valid string.
