Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. If the length of the set is 1, it means that all characters in the string are the same, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution works for all potential cases, including:

* Empty strings: The set of an empty string will be an empty set, and the length of an empty set is 0, so the function will correctly return `False`.
* Strings with a single character: The set of a string with a single character will contain only that character, and the length of the set will be 1, so the function will correctly return `True`.
* Strings with multiple characters: If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only that character, and the length of the set will be 1, so the function will correctly return `True`. If the string contains different characters, the set will contain more than one character, and the length of the set will be greater than 1, so the function will correctly return `False`.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct.
