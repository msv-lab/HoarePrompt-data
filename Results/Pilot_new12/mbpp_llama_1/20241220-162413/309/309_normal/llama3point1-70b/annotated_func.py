#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if string 's' contains only the same characters, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether all characters in `s` are the same. It returns `True` if the string contains only identical characters, and `False` otherwise, covering all potential cases including empty strings and strings with a single character.
