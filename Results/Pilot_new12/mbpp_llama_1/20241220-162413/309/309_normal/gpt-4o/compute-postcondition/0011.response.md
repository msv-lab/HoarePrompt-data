According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `char` must be the third character of `s`. The value of `first_char` remains the same as it is the first character of `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`**
