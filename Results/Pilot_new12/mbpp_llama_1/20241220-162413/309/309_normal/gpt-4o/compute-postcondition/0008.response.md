According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` (which is `first_char`). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters and `char` must be the second character of `s`.
State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
