According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `s` is already stated to be not empty, this condition is already met. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`, starting from the first character. 

So, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `char` should be the first character of `s`, which is the same as `first_char`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` (which is `first_char`)**
