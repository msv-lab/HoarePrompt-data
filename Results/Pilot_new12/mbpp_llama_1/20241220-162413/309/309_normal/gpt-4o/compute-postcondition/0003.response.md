The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. The previous value of `s` is a non-empty string. 

The value of `first_char` is the first character of `s`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, and `s` is not empty; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and `s` is not empty; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
