The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and checks if all characters in the string are the same. It returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters match the first character of the string, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters, including cases where all characters are the same or different. The input string `s` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. After the function concludes, the program state is updated with the return value, which indicates whether the string's characters are uniform or not.
