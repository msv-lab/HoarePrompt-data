#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns a boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where either all characters are the same as `first_char`, or the function returned `False` due to finding a different character, `first_char` remains the first character of the original string `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all characters in string `s` are the same as `first_char`, which is the first character of the original string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and checks if all characters in the string are the same. It returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters match the first character of the string, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters, including cases where all characters are the same or different. The input string `s` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. After the function concludes, the program state is updated with the return value, which indicates whether the string's characters are uniform or not.
