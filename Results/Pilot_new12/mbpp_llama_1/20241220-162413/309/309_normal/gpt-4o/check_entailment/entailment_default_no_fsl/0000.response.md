Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. Here's why:

1. **Handling Empty String**: The code correctly handles the case when the input string is empty. The line `if not s: return True` returns `True` for an empty string, which aligns with the problem description since an empty string can be considered as having all characters the same (a vacuous truth).

2. **Single Character String**: The code also correctly handles strings with a single character. Since the loop `for char in s:` only iterates once and will always find that the single character matches the first character of the string (which is itself), it will correctly return `True`.

3. **Multiple Character Strings**: For strings with multiple characters, the code iterates over each character and checks if it matches the first character. If all characters match the first character, it returns `True`. If it encounters any character that does not match the first character, it immediately returns `False`.

4. **Example Cases**: The provided assertion tests (`assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, `assert func_1('data') == False`) cover various cases and show that the function behaves as expected under these conditions.

Given that the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem and that the provided hints and examples do not reveal any contradictions to the code's functionality, it can be concluded that the code works correctly for all potential input cases within the described constraints.
