Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function handles the edge case where the input string is empty. In this case, it returns `True`, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. The function then checks each character in the string against the first character. If it finds a character that is different, it immediately returns `False`. This is correct because if there is at least one character that is different from the first character, then not all characters are the same.

3. If the function checks all characters in the string and does not find any that are different from the first character, it returns `True`. This is correct because if every character in the string is the same as the first character, then all characters in the string are the same.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function. For example, `assert func_1('python') == False` checks that the function correctly identifies a string where not all characters are the same, and `assert func_1('aaa') == True` checks that the function correctly identifies a string where all characters are the same.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
