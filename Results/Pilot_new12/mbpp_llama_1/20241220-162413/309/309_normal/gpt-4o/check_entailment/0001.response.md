Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. The function handles several cases correctly:

1. **Empty string**: If the string is empty (`if not s`), it returns `True`, which aligns with the problem description. Although it could be argued that an empty string does not have "same" characters, the provided unit test `assert func_1('') == True` supports this implementation choice.

2. **All characters are the same**: The function correctly identifies strings where all characters are identical. For example, `func_1('aaa')` returns `True`.

3. **Not all characters are the same**: The function correctly identifies strings where not all characters are the same. For instance, `func_1('python')` and `func_1('data')` both return `False`.

4. **Single character string**: The function implicitly handles the case of a single-character string (`s = 'a'`) correctly, returning `True`, because the loop only runs once and compares the character with itself, which is always `True`.

The provided unit tests cover various scenarios, and the function's logic seems sound for all potential cases. The function checks every character in the string, ensuring that if any character differs from the first, it immediately returns `False`. If it gets through the entire string without finding any differences, it returns `True`, indicating all characters are the same. Without a specific counterexample where the function fails to meet the problem description, it appears to be correct for all potential inputs.
