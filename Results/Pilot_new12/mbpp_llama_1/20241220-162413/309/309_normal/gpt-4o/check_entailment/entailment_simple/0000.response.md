Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same (since there are no characters to compare).
2. If the string is not empty, it stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.
3. It then iterates over each character in the string using a `for` loop. If it finds a character that is not equal to `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters in the string are the same.
4. If the loop completes without finding any characters that are not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The program handles all possible cases:

* If the input string is empty, it returns `True`.
* If the input string contains only one character, it returns `True`.
* If the input string contains multiple characters that are all the same, it returns `True`.
* If the input string contains multiple characters that are not all the same, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the program behaves correctly for different input scenarios.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
