Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. The function works by comparing each character in the string with the first character. If it finds any character that is different from the first character, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire string without finding any different characters, it returns `True`.

The function also correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, in which case it returns `True` as per the assertion `assert func_1('') == True` (although this assertion is not explicitly provided, it can be inferred from the condition `if not s: return True` in the function).

The provided unit tests `assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, and `assert func_1('data') == False` also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

In general, for any string `s`, the function will return `True` if all characters in `s` are the same, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
