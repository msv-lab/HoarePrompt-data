#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.

    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of a string of length 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string as input and returns its corresponding ASCII value as an integer. The function assumes the input string has a length of 1, but it does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the input string has a length other than 1. If the input string is not of length 1, the function will still return the ASCII value of the first character, but this behavior is not explicitly defined in the annotations. The function does not modify the input character string, and it does not perform any actions other than returning the ASCII value. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the ASCII value of the input character, but the original input character string remains unchanged.
