Since the provided code snippet doesn't execute any operation, but rather defines a docstring describing a function that returns the ASCII value of a given character, the output state will reflect the initial state with an additional understanding of what the described function does.

The initial state is that `char` is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.

Output State: **`char` is a string of length 1, and the ASCII value of `char` can be obtained, but it has not been explicitly returned or stored in a variable.**
