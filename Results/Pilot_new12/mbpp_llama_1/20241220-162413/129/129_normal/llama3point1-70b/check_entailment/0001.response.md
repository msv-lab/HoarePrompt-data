Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

1. Single characters: The function correctly returns the ASCII value of any single character, such as letters, digits, and special characters.
2. Unicode characters: The `ord` function also works with Unicode characters, so the function can handle characters outside the ASCII range.
3. Input validation: Although the function does not explicitly perform input validation, it will raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a string, which is a reasonable behavior for a function that expects a single character. If the input string has a length greater than 1, the function will still return the ASCII value of the first character, which might not be the expected behavior. However, this is not explicitly stated as an incorrect behavior in the problem description.

Overall, based on the provided problem description, the program correctly fulfills its requirements, and no edge cases were found where the program does not work as expected.
