You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of a string of length 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string as input and returns its corresponding ASCII value as an integer. The function assumes the input string has a length of 1, but it does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the input string has a length other than 1. If the input string is not of length 1, the function will still return the ASCII value of the first character, but this behavior is not explicitly defined in the annotations. The function does not modify the input character string, and it does not perform any actions other than returning the ASCII value. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the ASCII value of the input character, but the original input character string remains unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
