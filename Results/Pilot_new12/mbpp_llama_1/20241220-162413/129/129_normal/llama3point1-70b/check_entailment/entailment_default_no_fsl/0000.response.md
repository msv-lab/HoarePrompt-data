Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input string has a length other than 1. According to the problem description, the function should find the ASCII value of a character, but it does not specify what should happen if the input is not a single character. However, the code still returns the ASCII value of the first character when the input string has a length other than 1, which might not be the expected behavior. 

For example, if the input is "abc", the function will return the ASCII value of "a", but it's not clear if this is the correct behavior according to the problem description. The function does not include any error checking or handling for this case, which means it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

To fix this issue, the code could include a check to ensure the input string has a length of 1, and raise an error or return a specific value if it's not. For instance:

```python
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the input string is not a single character.
    """
    if len(char)!= 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a single character")
    return ord(char)
```
