You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(char: str) -> int` is designed to return the ASCII value of a given character. It uses Python's built-in `ord()` function to achieve this. The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, the `ord()` function works perfectly for finding ASCII values.

This function is correct for every potential case because:

1. It handles single characters correctly: The function takes a string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using `ord(char)`.
2. It raises an error when the input is not a single character: If the input string contains more than one character, the function will still work but it will return the ASCII value of the first character in the string. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be a single character, and the function's documentation also clearly states this. If the input is not a string at all (for example, an integer or None), the function will raise a TypeError, which is the expected behavior.
3. It works for all possible ASCII values: The `ord()` function in Python can handle all possible ASCII values (0-127) and even Unicode characters beyond the ASCII range.

Overall, the function is correctly implemented and follows the problem description. It does not contain any obvious errors and handles the specified input as expected. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of a string of length 1


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
