The original assessment states that the program is correct, with a correctness of **True**. Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment.

The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided code defines a function `func_1(char: str) -> int` that uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. It states that the input `char` is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character, which aligns with the problem description. The annotation also confirms that the function returns the ASCII value of the input character.

The original assessment highlights three key aspects of the program's correctness:

1. It handles single characters correctly.
2. It raises an error when the input is not a single character.
3. It works for all possible ASCII values.

The annotated version of the code supports the first aspect, as it confirms that the function returns the ASCII value of the input character. However, it does not explicitly address the second aspect, as it assumes that the input string has a length of 1. Nevertheless, the original assessment notes that if the input string contains more than one character, the function will still work but return the ASCII value of the first character, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem description.

The third aspect is also supported by the annotated version of the code, as it mentions that the function returns the ASCII value of the input character without any modifications or additional actions.

Given the information available, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description, and the annotated version of the code provides additional evidence to support the correctness of the program.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and my refined assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
