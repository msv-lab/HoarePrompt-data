Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function takes a string of length 1 as input, which is a single character.
2. The function uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of the character, which is the expected output.
3. The function returns an integer, which is the correct data type for the ASCII value.

Since the program does what the problem description says and meets all the requirements, it is correct. The `ord` function in Python is a built-in function that returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters (with Unicode code points in the range 0-127) corresponds to their ASCII value. Therefore, for the specified input of a single ASCII character, the program will always return the correct ASCII value.
