Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(char: str) -> int` is designed to return the ASCII value of a given character. It uses Python's built-in `ord()` function to achieve this. The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, the `ord()` function works perfectly for finding ASCII values.

This function is correct for every potential case because:

1. It handles single characters correctly: The function takes a string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using `ord(char)`.
2. It raises an error when the input is not a single character: If the input string contains more than one character, the function will still work but it will return the ASCII value of the first character in the string. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be a single character, and the function's documentation also clearly states this. If the input is not a string at all (for example, an integer or None), the function will raise a TypeError, which is the expected behavior.
3. It works for all possible ASCII values: The `ord()` function in Python can handle all possible ASCII values (0-127) and even Unicode characters beyond the ASCII range.

Overall, the function is correctly implemented and follows the problem description. It does not contain any obvious errors and handles the specified input as expected. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
