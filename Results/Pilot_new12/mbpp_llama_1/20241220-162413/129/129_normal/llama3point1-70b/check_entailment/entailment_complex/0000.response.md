Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that finds the ASCII value of a character. The provided function, `func_1`, takes a single character as input and returns its corresponding ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function.

The function's documentation clearly states that it returns the ASCII value of a given character, which aligns with the problem description. The function does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the input string has a length other than 1, but according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

In this case, since we assume the input will always be a single character, the function will always return the ASCII value of the input character, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct. 

The key point here is that the problem description does not require the function to handle invalid inputs, so the function's behavior for such inputs is not relevant to its correctness with respect to the given problem description.
