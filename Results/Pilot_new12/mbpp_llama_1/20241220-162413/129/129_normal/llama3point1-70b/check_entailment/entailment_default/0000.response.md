Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` assumes the input string has a length of 1, but it does not include any error checking or handling for cases where the input string has a length other than 1. If the input string is not of length 1, the function will still return the ASCII value of the first character, which may not be the expected behavior. According to the problem description, the function should find the ASCII value of a character, implying a single character. However, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, the function will only return the ASCII value of the first character, not of all the characters in the string. For example, if the input is "ab", the function will return the ASCII value of "a", not of "ab". This behavior may not align with the user's expectations. The code should either be modified to handle strings of length greater than 1 or include error checking to ensure the input string has a length of 1.
