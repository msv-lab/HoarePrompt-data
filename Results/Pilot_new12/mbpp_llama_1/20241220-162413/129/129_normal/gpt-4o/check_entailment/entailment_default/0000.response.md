Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it uses the built-in `ord()` function in Python to return the Unicode code point of the input character, which is equivalent to its ASCII value for characters in the ASCII range. The `ord()` function takes a single character as input and returns its Unicode code point, which is an integer. 

The function `func_1` does not have any explicit error checking, but based on the problem description, we assume that the input will be a single character. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves correctly for this type of input.

The output hints mention that the function may not handle cases where the input is not a single character, but since we assume that the input will always be a single character, this is not a concern. 

Overall, the code is simple and straightforward, and it correctly implements the function to find the ASCII value of a character, as long as the input is a single character.
