Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program's correctness can be evaluated as follows:

The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The original code defines a function `func_1` that takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. The `ord` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value.

The annotations provided confirm that the function takes a single character as input (`char is a single character`) and returns the Unicode point of the single character (`The program returns the Unicode point of the single character 'char'.`).

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct (`Correctness: **True**`) because the function works correctly for all possible input characters, and its behavior is consistent with the problem description. The assessment also notes that the `ord` function is a built-in Python function that returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value.

After reviewing the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, taking a single character as input and returning its ASCII value. The use of the `ord` function is a simple yet effective solution to the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
