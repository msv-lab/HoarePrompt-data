You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program uses Python's built-in `ord` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character. This function works correctly for all single characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, special characters, and whitespace.

The provided assertion statements demonstrate the function's correctness for specific characters, and the same logic applies to all other characters. Since the `ord` function is a standard Python function, it is expected to work correctly in all cases, assuming the input is a single character.

For example, `func_1('a')` would return `97`, `func_1('0')` would return `48`, and `func_1('@')` would return `64`. The function will handle any single character input correctly and return its corresponding ASCII value.

The only potential edge case to consider is if the input is not a single character (e.g., a string of multiple characters, a non-string type). However, based on the problem description, which asks to find the ASCII value of a character, it can be assumed that the input is a single character. If the input is not a single character, the function may not work as expected or may raise an exception.

In the context of the problem description, which specifically mentions finding the ASCII value of a character, and assuming that the input is always a single character, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode point of the single character 'char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character as input and returns its corresponding Unicode code point. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, such as an empty string, a string of length greater than 1, or a non-string input, which may result in an error. The function's return value is an integer representing the Unicode point of the input character. If the input character is a valid Unicode character, the function will return its Unicode code point; otherwise, it may raise an exception or produce an undefined result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
