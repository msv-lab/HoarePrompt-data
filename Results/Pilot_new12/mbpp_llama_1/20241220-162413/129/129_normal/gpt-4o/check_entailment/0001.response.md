Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. The function is straightforward and works correctly for all possible input characters.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for uppercase letters ('A', 'R', 'S'). However, the function will also work correctly for lowercase letters, digits, and other special characters.

For example, `func_1('a')` will return `97`, `func_1('1')` will return `49`, and `func_1('@')` will return `64`. This function handles all possible input characters, and its behavior is consistent with the problem description.

Since we cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct. The `ord` function is a built-in Python function that returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value, making this function a simple yet effective solution to the problem.
