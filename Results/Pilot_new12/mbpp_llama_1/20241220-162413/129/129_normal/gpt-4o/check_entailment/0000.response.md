Correctness: **True**

The program uses Python's built-in `ord` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character. This function works correctly for all single characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, special characters, and whitespace.

The provided assertion statements demonstrate the function's correctness for specific characters, and the same logic applies to all other characters. Since the `ord` function is a standard Python function, it is expected to work correctly in all cases, assuming the input is a single character.

For example, `func_1('a')` would return `97`, `func_1('0')` would return `48`, and `func_1('@')` would return `64`. The function will handle any single character input correctly and return its corresponding ASCII value.

The only potential edge case to consider is if the input is not a single character (e.g., a string of multiple characters, a non-string type). However, based on the problem description, which asks to find the ASCII value of a character, it can be assumed that the input is a single character. If the input is not a single character, the function may not work as expected or may raise an exception.

In the context of the problem description, which specifically mentions finding the ASCII value of a character, and assuming that the input is always a single character, the program is correct.
