Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in Python function `ord`, which returns the Unicode point of a character. Since ASCII values are a subset of Unicode points, this function correctly returns the ASCII value of a character.

For example, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65, 'R' is 82, and 'S' is 83. The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for these cases.

The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character. For characters in the ASCII range (0-127), the Unicode point is equivalent to the ASCII value. Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a single character.

As we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a single character or is not a valid ASCII character. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
