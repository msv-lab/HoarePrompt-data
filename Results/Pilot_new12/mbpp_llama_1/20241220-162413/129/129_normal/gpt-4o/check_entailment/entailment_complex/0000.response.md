Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that by using the built-in Python function `ord()`, which returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, `ord()` effectively returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters.

The provided assertions and annotations also confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function takes a single character as input and returns its corresponding Unicode code point, which for ASCII characters, is equivalent to their ASCII value.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a single character), the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a single character. Therefore, under the constraints provided, the function correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description.
