Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, such as an empty string, a string of length greater than 1, or a non-string input. For example, if the input is an empty string (''), the function will raise a TypeError because the ord() function expects a single character and not an empty string. Similarly, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, the function will also raise a TypeError. 

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a string, such as an integer or a list. In these cases, the function will also raise a TypeError.

For instance, the following test cases will fail:

- func_1('') 
- func_1('abc')
- func_1(123)
- func_1([1, 2, 3])

These cases are not handled in the provided code and hence, the code is not correct for every potential case.
