You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode point of the single character 'char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character as input and returns its corresponding Unicode code point. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, such as an empty string, a string of length greater than 1, or a non-string input, which may result in an error. The function's return value is an integer representing the Unicode point of the input character. If the input character is a valid Unicode character, the function will return its Unicode code point; otherwise, it may raise an exception or produce an undefined result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
