The function accepts a single character as input and returns its corresponding Unicode code point. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, such as an empty string, a string of length greater than 1, or a non-string input, which may result in an error. The function's return value is an integer representing the Unicode point of the input character. If the input character is a valid Unicode character, the function will return its Unicode code point; otherwise, it may raise an exception or produce an undefined result.
