Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The use of the `zip` function ensures that the function works with tuples of the same length. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will return `(-3, -3, -3)` as expected.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error handling. If the input tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple due to the behavior of the `zip` function. If the problem description requires the function to handle tuples of different lengths, the function would be considered incorrect.

But based on the given problem description, which does not specify what to do with tuples of different lengths, the function is correct. 

To make the function more robust, you could add a check to ensure that the input tuples are of the same length, and raise an error if they are not. For example:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
