Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input, which is in line with the problem description.
2. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel, which ensures that corresponding elements from both tuples are processed together.
3. For each pair of corresponding elements `a` from `tup1` and `b` from `tup2`, the function calculates the difference `a - b`, which is exactly what the problem description requires.
4. The results of these subtractions are collected into a new tuple using a generator expression, which is then returned by the function.
5. The resulting tuple has the same length as the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, which is also in line with the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the required behavior for all potential cases, where the input tuples have the same length and contain numbers (either integers or floats), the correctness of the program is True.
