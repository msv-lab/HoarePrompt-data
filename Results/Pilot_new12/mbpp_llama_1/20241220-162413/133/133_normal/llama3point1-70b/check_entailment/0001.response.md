Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it properly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the elements of `tup1` by the elements of `tup2` with the same index. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function pairs corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2` together, which allows for the subtraction operation to be performed on elements at the same index.
- The `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` expression is a generator that performs the subtraction operation on each pair of elements.
- The `tuple(...)` function converts the generator into a tuple, which is the return value of the function.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including tuples of the same length with numeric elements. It will raise an error if the tuples are of different lengths or if the elements are not numeric, but this behavior is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what to do in these cases. 

For example, if you call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which is the expected result. 

If you call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`, the function will return `(-3, -3)`, which is also correct because `zip` stops at the end of the shorter tuple. 

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases.
