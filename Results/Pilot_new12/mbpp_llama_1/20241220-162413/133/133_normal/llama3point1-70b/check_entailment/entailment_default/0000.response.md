Correctness: **False**.

The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the input tuples are not of the same length. The `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, and any extra elements in the longer tuple will be ignored. This is not as per the problem description, which requires the function to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`, the function will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)`, which is `(-3, -3)`, but it should actually raise an error or return a specific value to indicate that the tuples are not of the same length. 

Also, the code does not handle the case where the input tuples contain non-numeric values. If we call `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 'b'))`, the function will raise a TypeError, because it will try to subtract a string from an integer.

However, based on the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code seems to be mostly correct. It performs the element-wise subtraction operation as expected, and returns the result as a tuple. But since it does not handle the case of tuples with different lengths and non-numeric values (even though we assume valid input), and the problem description does not explicitly state what to do in these cases, it can be considered incorrect.
