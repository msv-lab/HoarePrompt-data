Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases. According to the problem description, the function should take in two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. However, the code does not check if the input tuples are of the same length or if they contain only numbers. 

If the tuples are of different lengths, the zip function in the code will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which means some elements in the longer tuple will be ignored. For example, if `tup1` is `(1, 2, 3)` and `tup2` is `(4, 5)`, the function will return `(1-4, 2-5) = (-3, -3)`, instead of raising an error or returning an error message.

If the tuples contain non-numeric values, the subtraction operation will raise a TypeError. For example, if `tup1` is `(1, 'a', 3)` and `tup2` is `(4, 'b', 5)`, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to subtract 'a' and 'b'.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
