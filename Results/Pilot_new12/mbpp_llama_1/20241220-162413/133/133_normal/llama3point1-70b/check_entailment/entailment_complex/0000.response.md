Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: Although the program does not explicitly validate its inputs, the problem description assumes that the inputs will be valid. Therefore, we can assume that `tup1` and `tup2` will always be tuples of the same length, containing numbers (either integers or floats).

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The program uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel. For each pair of elements, it subtracts the element from `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1` using a generator expression. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Return Value**: The result of the element-wise subtraction operation is returned as a tuple, which has the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

4. **No Error Checking**: The problem description explicitly states that the program does not handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` are not tuples, are not of the same length, or do not contain only numbers. Since we assume that the inputs will be valid, this is not a concern.

In summary, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, assuming that the inputs will be valid. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
