#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numbers (either integers or floats).
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple of the same length as tup1 and tup2, containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2, where each difference is a number (either an integer or a float) resulting from subtracting an element from tup2 from the corresponding element in tup1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length, containing numbers (either integers or floats), and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. Each difference is a number (either an integer or a float) resulting from subtracting an element from `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. The function does not handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` are not tuples, are not of the same length, or do not contain only numbers. The function performs a simple element-wise subtraction operation and returns the result as a tuple, leaving the input tuples unchanged. The returned tuple will have the same length as the input tuples, and its elements will be the result of the subtraction operation, potentially resulting in a mix of integers and floats, depending on the input values. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for potential edge cases, such as division by zero (which is not applicable in this case since only subtraction is performed), non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths.
