The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numbers (either integers or floats). After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length, and return a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, which are tuples of the same length containing numbers, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2.**
