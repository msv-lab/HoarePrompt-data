Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior of subtracting the elements of the first tuple from the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function utilizes the built-in `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The result is then converted back to a tuple.

The use of `zip` ensures that the function stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, which is the expected behavior for this problem. However, it's worth noting that if the tuples are of different lengths and the user wants to handle the extra elements in the longer tuple (if any), additional logic would be needed. But based on the provided problem description and examples, this does not seem to be a requirement.

The function has been tested with several examples and the results match the expectations. Without additional requirements or examples that could potentially demonstrate incorrect behavior, it's reasonable to conclude that the function behaves as intended for the given problem description.
