Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from the input tuples. The function utilizes the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from the two tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction.

The code handles the case where the input tuples are of the same length and contain only numbers, as required by the problem description. The use of `zip` ensures that the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if the input tuples are not of the same length, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

The problem description does not specify what to do if the input tuples contain non-numeric values or are not of the same length, but based on the output hints, it is clear that the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to perform subtraction on non-numeric values and ignore any extra elements in the longer tuple.

Since the code behaves as expected according to the problem description and output hints for all valid inputs, the correctness of the code is **True**.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function works correctly for different input scenarios. For example:

* The test `assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)` checks that the function correctly subtracts corresponding elements from the input tuples.
* The test `assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)` checks that the function correctly handles cases where the results of the subtraction are negative.

Overall, the code accurately implements the described functionality, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
