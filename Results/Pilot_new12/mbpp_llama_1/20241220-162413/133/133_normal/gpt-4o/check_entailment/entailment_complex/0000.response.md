Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input, subtracts the elements of `tup2` from the elements of `tup1` at the same index, and returns the result as a tuple.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel. This ensures that the subtraction operation is performed element-wise, as required by the problem description.
2. The `tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))` expression performs the subtraction operation for each pair of elements and returns the result as a tuple.
3. The function returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, which meets the requirement specified in the problem description.
4. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and contain only numbers, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program will not encounter any errors due to invalid input. Therefore, the program will always produce the correct result, which is a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program behaves correctly for various input scenarios. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified by the provided unit tests.
