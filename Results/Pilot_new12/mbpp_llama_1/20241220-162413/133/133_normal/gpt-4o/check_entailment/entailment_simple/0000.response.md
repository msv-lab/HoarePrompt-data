Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. 

The `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel, and a generator expression is used to calculate the differences between corresponding elements. The `tuple` function is then used to convert the resulting generator expression into a tuple, which is returned by the function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, and the use of the `zip` function ensures that the function will work correctly even if the input tuples have different lengths (although it will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, due to the way `zip` works).

There are no obvious cases where the program would not follow the problem description, assuming that the input will always be valid (i.e., two tuples of the same length containing numbers). The program's logic is straightforward and directly implements the required behavior, making it correct according to the problem description.
