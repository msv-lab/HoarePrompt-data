You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior of subtracting the elements of the first tuple from the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function utilizes the built-in `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The result is then converted back to a tuple.

The use of `zip` ensures that the function stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, which is the expected behavior for this problem. However, it's worth noting that if the tuples are of different lengths and the user wants to handle the extra elements in the longer tuple (if any), additional logic would be needed. But based on the provided problem description and examples, this does not seem to be a requirement.

The function has been tested with several examples and the results match the expectations. Without additional requirements or examples that could potentially demonstrate incorrect behavior, it's reasonable to conclude that the function behaves as intended for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples of numbers, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The returned tuple has the same length as the input tuples. The function performs element-wise subtraction, where each element in `tup1` is subtracted by the corresponding element in `tup2`. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and contain only numbers. If the input tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. If the input tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to perform subtraction on these values. After the function concludes, the original input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` remain unchanged, and the returned tuple contains the calculated differences.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
