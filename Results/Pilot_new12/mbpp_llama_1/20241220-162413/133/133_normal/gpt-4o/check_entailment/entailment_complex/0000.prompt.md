You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numbers.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples of numbers, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The returned tuple has the same length as the input tuples. The function performs element-wise subtraction, where each element in `tup1` is subtracted by the corresponding element in `tup2`. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and contain only numbers. If the input tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. If the input tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to perform subtraction on these values. After the function concludes, the original input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` remain unchanged, and the returned tuple contains the calculated differences.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
