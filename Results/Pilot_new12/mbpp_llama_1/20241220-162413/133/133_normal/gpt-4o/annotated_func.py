#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numbers.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples of numbers, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The returned tuple has the same length as the input tuples. The function performs element-wise subtraction, where each element in `tup1` is subtracted by the corresponding element in `tup2`. The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and contain only numbers. If the input tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. If the input tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to perform subtraction on these values. After the function concludes, the original input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` remain unchanged, and the returned tuple contains the calculated differences.
