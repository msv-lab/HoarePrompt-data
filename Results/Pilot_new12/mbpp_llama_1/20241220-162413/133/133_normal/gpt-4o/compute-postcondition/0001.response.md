The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numbers. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples of numbers, returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from the input tuples.**
