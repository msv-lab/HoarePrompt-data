The program uses the zip function to iterate over two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, in parallel. For each pair of corresponding elements `a` and `b` from `tup1` and `tup2`, it calculates the difference `a - b`. The results of these subtractions are collected into a new tuple, which is then returned.

Since `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numbers, the returned tuple will also be of the same length, containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of the same length as `tup1` and `tup2`, containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
