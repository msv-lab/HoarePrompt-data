Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly convert a list to a tuple. The `tuple()` function in Python takes an iterable (like a list) and returns a tuple containing all the elements of the iterable. This function handles the conversion for lists of any size and containing any types of elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where this function does not work as expected according to the problem description. It should correctly handle:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- Lists with one element: `func_1([1])` returns `(1,)`
- Lists with multiple elements: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`
- Lists containing different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', True, 3.14])` returns `(1, 'a', True, 3.14)`

Given that it handles all these cases and more, the code provided appears to be correct for its intended purpose.
