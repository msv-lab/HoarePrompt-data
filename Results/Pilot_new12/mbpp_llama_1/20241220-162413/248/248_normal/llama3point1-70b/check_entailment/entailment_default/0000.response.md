Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple function that takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The function `func_1` directly uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple. This approach ensures that the order of elements is preserved, as tuples maintain the order of elements from the original iterable.

The output hints agree with the code, mentioning that the function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple, and preserves the order of elements. Although the hints mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, the problem description and the assumption of valid input mean that this aspect does not affect the correctness of the function. 

Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid list, the function `func_1` correctly converts any list into a tuple for every potential valid case, without any need for error handling for invalid inputs. The function directly and efficiently achieves the goal described in the problem statement.
