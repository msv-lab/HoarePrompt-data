Based on the provided problem description and annotated program, the correctness of the program can be evaluated as follows:

The problem description requires a function to convert a list to a tuple. The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to perform the conversion.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

* It accepts a list as input and returns a tuple.
* It preserves the order of elements from the input list in the output tuple.
* It handles edge cases where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list), the program's lack of error checking or handling for non-list inputs does not affect its correctness in this context.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.

Correctness: **True**
