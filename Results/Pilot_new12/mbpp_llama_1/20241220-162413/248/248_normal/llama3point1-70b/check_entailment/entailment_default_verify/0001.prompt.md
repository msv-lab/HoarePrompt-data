You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly convert a list to a tuple. The `tuple()` function in Python takes an iterable (like a list) and returns a tuple containing all the elements of the iterable. This function handles the conversion for lists of any size and containing any types of elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where this function does not work as expected according to the problem description. It should correctly handle:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- Lists with one element: `func_1([1])` returns `(1,)`
- Lists with multiple elements: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`
- Lists containing different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', True, 3.14])` returns `(1, 'a', True, 3.14)`

Given that it handles all these cases and more, the code provided appears to be correct for its intended purpose.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The input list remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple. It also preserves the order of elements from the input list in the output tuple. Additionally, the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, so it assumes that the input will always be a list. If the input is not a list, the function may raise an exception.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
