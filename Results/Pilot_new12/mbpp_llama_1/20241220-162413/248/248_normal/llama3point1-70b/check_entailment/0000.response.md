Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to convert a list to a tuple. It uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function, which does exactly that. This function should work correctly for all lists, including empty lists and lists containing any type of object, including strings, integers, floats, and even other lists.

There are no edge cases that the function does not handle. For example, if you pass an empty list to the function, it will return an empty tuple. If you pass a list containing nested lists or other complex structures, the function will still work correctly, because tuples can contain any type of object.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

```python
# Test case 1: A simple list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_1(my_list))  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Test case 2: An empty list
my_list = []
print(func_1(my_list))  # Output: ()

# Test case 3: A list containing strings
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(func_1(my_list))  # Output: ('a', 'b', 'c')

# Test case 4: A list containing nested lists
my_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]
print(func_1(my_list))  # Output: (1, [2, 3], 4)
```

All of these test cases work as expected, and there are no obvious edge cases where the function would not work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
