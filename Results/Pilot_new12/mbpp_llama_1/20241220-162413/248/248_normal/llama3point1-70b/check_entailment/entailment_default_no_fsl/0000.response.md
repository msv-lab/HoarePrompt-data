Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple, and preserves the order of elements from the input list in the output tuple. 

The program description asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple, which the provided code does correctly. The output hints agree with the code's functionality, and the code should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

It's worth noting that the function does not include error checking for non-list inputs. However, since we assume the input will always be valid, this does not affect the program's correctness in this context. The program will raise an exception if the input is not a list, but this is outside the scope of the problem description. 

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for every potential valid case.
