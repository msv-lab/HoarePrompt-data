Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to convert a list to a tuple as described in the problem description. 

Here's why:

- The function `func_1(input_list)` takes a list as input.
- Inside the function, `tuple(input_list)` is used to convert the input list into a tuple. This is the standard way to convert a list to a tuple in Python.
- The function then returns this tuple, which contains all elements from the input list.

Since the program does exactly what the problem description asks for, it is correct. The conversion from list to tuple is handled correctly, and the function will work as expected for any valid input list. 

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, the function will return `(1, 2, 3)`, which is the tuple equivalent of the input list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirement to convert a list to a tuple.
