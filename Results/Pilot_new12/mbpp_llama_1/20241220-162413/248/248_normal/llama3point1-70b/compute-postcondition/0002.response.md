Functionality: **The function accepts a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The input list remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple. It also preserves the order of elements from the input list in the output tuple. Additionally, the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, so it assumes that the input will always be a list. If the input is not a list, the function may raise an exception.**
