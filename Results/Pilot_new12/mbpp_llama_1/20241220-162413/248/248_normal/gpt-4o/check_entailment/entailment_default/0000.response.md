Correctness: **True**
The code provided, `func_1`, directly addresses the problem description by converting a given list into a tuple, preserving the order and content of the elements. The function, `func_1`, utilizes Python's built-in `tuple()` function to achieve this conversion, which is a straightforward and standard approach. The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that `func_1` accepts a list, converts it into a tuple, and returns the tuple without modifying the original list. The function's behavior is consistent across lists of varying lengths and contents, including the handling of empty lists, as it will return an empty tuple in such cases.

Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid list, the function does not require additional error checking or handling for non-list inputs. Since the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input lists, and considering the nature of the `tuple()` function, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for all potential valid list inputs. Therefore, the code accurately fulfills the problem's requirements as described.
