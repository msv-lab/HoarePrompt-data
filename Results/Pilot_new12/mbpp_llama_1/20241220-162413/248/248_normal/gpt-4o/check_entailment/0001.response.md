Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and returns a tuple. The function uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list to a tuple. 

This program is correct because it works for every potential case. It correctly handles lists of different lengths and with different types of elements (as long as the elements are hashable, which is a requirement for tuple elements in Python). 

For example, it will correctly convert an empty list `[]` to an empty tuple `()`, a list with a single element `[1]` to a tuple with a single element `(1,)`, and a list with multiple elements `[1, 2, 3]` to a tuple with multiple elements `(1, 2, 3)`.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific input cases. 

There are no edge cases or potential cases where this program would not work as expected, as long as the input is a list (or any other iterable). If the input is not a list but another type of iterable (like a set or a dictionary), the function would still work correctly and return a tuple of the elements in the iterable.
