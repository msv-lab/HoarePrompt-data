The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to convert a list into a tuple. The function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple that includes all elements from the list. 

Here's why the function is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The problem description requires the function to convert a list into a tuple. The function `func_1` does exactly this by using Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list `lst` into a tuple.

2. **Input and Output**: The function expects a list as input and returns a tuple as output, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handling of Elements**: The function includes all elements from the input list in the output tuple, without modifying or omitting any elements. This is demonstrated by the provided unit tests, which show that the function correctly converts lists of varying lengths and contents into tuples.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As per the problem statement, it's assumed that the input will always be a valid list. Therefore, the function does not need to include error checking or handling for cases where the input might not be a list.

Since the function `func_1` accurately performs the task described in the problem description and handles all potential cases given the assumption of valid input, it is considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
