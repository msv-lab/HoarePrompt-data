Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function, which takes an iterable (in this case, a list) as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the elements from the iterable, in the same order.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The provided unit tests confirm the correctness of the function for various lists. Additionally, the function should also handle edge cases such as:

- An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- A list with a single element: `func_1([5])` returns `(5,)`
- A list with duplicate elements: `func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7])` returns `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
- A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns `(-1, -2, -3)`
- A list with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])` returns `(1.1, 2.2, 3.3)`

In all cases, the function behaves as expected, converting the input list to a tuple without modifying the elements or their order. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
