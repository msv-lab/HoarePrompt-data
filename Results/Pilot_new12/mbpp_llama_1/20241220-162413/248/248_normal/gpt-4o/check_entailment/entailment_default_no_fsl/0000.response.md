Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements a function to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input, creates a tuple from it using the built-in `tuple()` function, and returns the resulting tuple. This solution meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input lists. Additionally, the output hints describe the function's behavior accurately, including the preservation of element order, handling of lists of any length, and the fact that the original list remains unchanged.

The assumption that the input will be a valid list is also taken into account, as per the problem description. The function does not include error checking for non-list inputs, but since we assume the user will always provide a valid list, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Overall, the code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases, making the correctness of the function **True**.
