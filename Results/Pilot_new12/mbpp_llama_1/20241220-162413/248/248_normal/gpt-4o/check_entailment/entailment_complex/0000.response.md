Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to convert a list to a tuple, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. It takes a list `lst` as input, creates a tuple containing all elements from `lst` using the `tuple()` function, and returns this tuple.

The function handles lists of any length and content as specified, including lists with elements of different data types, and it does not modify the original list. The function also works correctly when the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple as expected.

The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for several example cases, including lists with different lengths and contents.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking or handling for non-list inputs does not affect the correctness of the program in this context. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
