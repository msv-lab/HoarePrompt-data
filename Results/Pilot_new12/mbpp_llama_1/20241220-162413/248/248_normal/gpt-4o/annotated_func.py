#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple that contains all elements from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as a parameter, creates a tuple containing all elements from `lst`, and returns this tuple. This means the function effectively converts a given list into its tuple equivalent, preserving the order and content of the elements. The function handles lists of any length and content, including empty lists, and returns a tuple of corresponding length and content. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The state of the original list `lst` remains unchanged after the function call, as tuples are immutable in Python and the function does not modify the original list. The function does not include any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, so it assumes that the user will always provide a valid list.
