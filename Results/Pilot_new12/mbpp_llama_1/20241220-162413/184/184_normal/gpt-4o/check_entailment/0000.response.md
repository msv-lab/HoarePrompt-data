Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, the number is odd and is included in the resulting list.

This implementation correctly identifies odd numbers by utilizing the mathematical property that odd numbers always leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The function handles lists containing both odd and even numbers, as well as lists containing only odd or only even numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the function correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases. It correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.
