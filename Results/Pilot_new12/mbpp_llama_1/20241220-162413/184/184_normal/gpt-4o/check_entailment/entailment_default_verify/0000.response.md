The original assessment states that the program is correct, which aligns with the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a given list of integers, and the implementation correctly identifies odd numbers using the mathematical property that odd numbers always leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

The output hints provide additional context and edge cases, but they do not contradict the original assessment. The hints mention that the function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list or a list with no odd integers, which is expected behavior for a function that filters odd numbers. The hints also mention that the function does not perform error checking on the input type, but this is not a requirement for the problem description, which assumes that the input will be a valid list of integers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles expected edge cases.

Final: **True**
