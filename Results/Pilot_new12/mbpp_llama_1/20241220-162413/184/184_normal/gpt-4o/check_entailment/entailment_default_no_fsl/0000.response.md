Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a function `func_1` that filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd.

The function handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, as demonstrated by the fact that the list comprehension will simply return an empty list if the input list is empty. The function also handles the case where the input list contains no odd integers, again returning an empty list.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, but according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid, i.e., a non-empty list of integers.

All the provided unit tests pass, and the function behaves as expected for the given examples. There are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. 

Therefore, the code is correct for the given problem description.
