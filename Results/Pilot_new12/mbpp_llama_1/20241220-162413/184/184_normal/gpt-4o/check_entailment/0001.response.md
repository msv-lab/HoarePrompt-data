Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that are odd, i.e., `num % 2!= 0`.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to be correct and handles all potential cases. The function correctly identifies odd numbers by using the modulo operator (`%`), which returns the remainder of the division of the number by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the number is odd.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios, including:

* A list with both odd and even numbers
* A list with a mix of small and large numbers
* A list with odd numbers in the beginning, middle, and end

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty list: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected result.
* A list with only even numbers: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected result.
* A list with only odd numbers: The function will return the original list, which is the expected result.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases, and the provided unit tests support its correctness, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
