Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description's requirements. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out the even integers by checking if each number `num` in the list `nums` satisfies the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is true for odd numbers.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as an empty input list or a list with no odd integers, by returning an empty list. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, demonstrate that the function works as expected for various inputs.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking on the input type does not affect the correctness of the program. The function will correctly filter out odd numbers from a list of integers, as required by the problem description.
