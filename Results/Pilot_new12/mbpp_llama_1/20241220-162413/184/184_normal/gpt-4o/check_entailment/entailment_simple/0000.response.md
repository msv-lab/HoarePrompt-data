Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a given list of integers `nums` and return them in a new list.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `nums`.
2. For each number, it checks if the remainder of the division of `num` by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). This is the condition for a number to be odd.
3. If the number is odd, it is included in the new list being created.
4. The function returns the new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function by checking its output for different input scenarios. The function behaves as expected, returning the correct list of odd numbers for each test case.

In general, the function will work correctly for any list of integers, filtering out the odd numbers and returning them in a new list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.
