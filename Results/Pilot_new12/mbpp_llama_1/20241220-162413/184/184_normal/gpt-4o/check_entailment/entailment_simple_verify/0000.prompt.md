You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, the number is odd and is included in the resulting list.

This implementation correctly identifies odd numbers by utilizing the mathematical property that odd numbers always leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The function handles lists containing both odd and even numbers, as well as lists containing only odd or only even numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the function correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases. It correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
