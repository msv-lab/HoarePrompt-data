The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. However, based on the provided code, the function actually filters in odd numbers, not out. The condition `num % 2!= 0` checks if a number is odd, and if it is, the number is included in the resulting list.

The problem description states that the task is to "Write a function to filter odd numbers." This description is ambiguous, as it does not specify whether the function should filter out or filter in odd numbers. However, based on the provided unit tests, it appears that the intention is to filter in odd numbers.

The annotated version of the code confirms this interpretation, stating that "The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'". This annotation suggests that the function is intended to filter in odd numbers, not out.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is incorrect, but not because the function is incorrect. Rather, the original assessment misinterprets the function's behavior. The function is actually correct, but its behavior is the opposite of what the original assessment claims.

Since the function meets the problem description (in the sense that it filters in odd numbers), and the annotations support this interpretation, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
