Correctness: **True**

The code defines a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes only the numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if a number is odd.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list, leaving the input list unchanged. The hints also mention that the function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list or a list with no odd integers by returning an empty list.

The provided unit tests `assert` statements demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with a mix of even and odd numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code appears to be correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. The function correctly filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers, as expected.
