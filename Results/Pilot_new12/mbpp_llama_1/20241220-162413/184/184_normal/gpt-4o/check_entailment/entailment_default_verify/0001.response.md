The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list, leaving only odd numbers in the output list. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new list based on certain conditions.

The output hints also support the original assessment, as they describe the function's behavior in line with the provided code and problem description. The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out even integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The output hints also mention that the function does not perform error checking on the input type, but this is not a concern given the assumption that the input will be a valid list of integers.

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's ability to handle edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with no odd integers. The function will indeed return an empty list in these cases, which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
