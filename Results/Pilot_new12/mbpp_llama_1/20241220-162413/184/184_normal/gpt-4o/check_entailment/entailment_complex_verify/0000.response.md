The original assessment states that the program is correct, with a correctness of **True**. After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment.

The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers from a given list of integers. The provided code implements a function `func_1` that uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes a number in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`).

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, including the state of the program before the function call and the overall behavior of the function. The annotation confirms that the function accepts a list of integers as input, returns a new list containing only the odd integers, and does not modify the input list.

The original assessment correctly identifies the key points:

1. The function uses the mathematical property that odd numbers leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
2. The function handles lists containing both odd and even numbers, as well as lists containing only odd or only even numbers.
3. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function.

I maintain the original assessment because:

* The code correctly implements the required functionality.
* The annotations provide additional context and confirm the correctness of the function.
* The unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior and correctness.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
