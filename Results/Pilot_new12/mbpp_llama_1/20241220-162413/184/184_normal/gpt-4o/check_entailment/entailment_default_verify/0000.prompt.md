You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, the number is odd and is included in the resulting list.

This implementation correctly identifies odd numbers by utilizing the mathematical property that odd numbers always leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The function handles lists containing both odd and even numbers, as well as lists containing only odd or only even numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the function correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases. It correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list, effectively filtering out all even integers. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list (returning an empty list) or a list with no odd integers (returning an empty list). The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so if the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
