#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list, effectively filtering out all even integers. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list (returning an empty list) or a list with no odd integers (returning an empty list). The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so if the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results.
