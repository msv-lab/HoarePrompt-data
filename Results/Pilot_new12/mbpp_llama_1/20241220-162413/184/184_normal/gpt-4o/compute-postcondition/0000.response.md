The code snippet is a list comprehension that iterates over each number in the list `nums` and includes it in the output list if the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`). 

Given the initial state that `nums` is a list of integers, the code will filter out the even numbers and return a list of odd numbers from `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'**
