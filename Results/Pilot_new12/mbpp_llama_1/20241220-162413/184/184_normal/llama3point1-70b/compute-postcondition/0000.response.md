The given code snippet utilizes a list comprehension to filter the input list `nums` and return a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums`. 

Since `nums` is a list of integers, the list comprehension iterates over each integer `num` in `nums`. It checks if `num` is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is true for odd numbers because the remainder of an odd number divided by 2 is always 1 (which is not equal to 0). If the condition is true, `num` is included in the new list.

Therefore, the program returns a list of integers that are odd, and these integers are from the original list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`.**
