Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each number `num` in `nums` and includes it in the output list if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`), which is the definition of an odd number.

The function correctly handles various potential cases, including:

- Empty input list: If `nums` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list, which is the expected result since there are no numbers to filter.
- List with only even numbers: If `nums` contains only even numbers, the function will return an empty list, correctly filtering out all the even numbers.
- List with only odd numbers: If `nums` contains only odd numbers, the function will return the original list, since all numbers are odd and should be included.
- List with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function will return a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list, correctly filtering out the even numbers.
- List containing non-integer numbers: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle non-integer numbers, the function will still work correctly as per its mathematical definition. For floating-point numbers, the modulo operation (`%`) will return the remainder of the division, which for odd integer values (represented as floats) will still correctly identify them as odd. However, for non-integer floating-point numbers, their "oddness" or "evenness" is not typically considered in the usual mathematical sense, but the function will apply the modulo operation as defined for floats.

Given these considerations, the program appears to correctly implement a function to filter odd numbers from a list, according to the provided problem description, without any apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly.
