Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function, `func_1`, is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, effectively selecting all odd integers.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that it correctly filters out even integers, handles empty lists, lists without odd integers, and lists with duplicate integers by preserving the duplicates if they are odd. The hints also mention that the function does not perform error checking on the input type, assuming the input will always be a list of integers, which is in line with the problem's assumption of valid input.

Given the function's implementation and the output hints, there are no apparent cases where the program fails to work as described in the problem description, assuming valid input. The list comprehension approach ensures that all odd numbers are correctly identified and included in the output list, and the function behaves as expected for various edge cases such as empty lists, lists with no odd integers, and lists containing duplicate odd integers.
