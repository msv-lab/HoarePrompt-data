Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

- The function filters out even numbers and only returns odd numbers from the input list `nums`. This is achieved by the condition `num % 2!= 0` in the list comprehension, which checks if a number is odd.
- It handles empty lists by returning an empty list because the list comprehension will be empty if `nums` is empty.
- It preserves duplicate integers in the output list if they are odd because list comprehensions include every element from the input list that meets the condition, regardless of duplicates.
- The function returns a list of integers, which will be empty if the input list contains no odd integers, thus meeting the problem description's criteria.

The assumption that the input will always be a list of integers (and thus valid) is crucial here, as the function does not include error checking for non-integer values or non-list inputs. However, based on the provided problem description and the annotations, the function behaves as specified for valid inputs. It correctly filters odd numbers from the input list, handles edge cases like empty lists or lists without odd integers, and preserves duplicate odd integers. Therefore, the function is correct according to the given problem description and assumptions about input validity.
