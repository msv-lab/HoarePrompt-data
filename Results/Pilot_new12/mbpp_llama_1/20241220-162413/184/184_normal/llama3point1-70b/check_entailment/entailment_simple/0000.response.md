Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It filters odd numbers from the input list `nums` and returns them in a new list.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input**: The function expects a list of integers as input, which aligns with the problem description's assumption of a valid input.
2. **Filtering**: The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list. This is achieved by checking each number `num` in the input list to see if it leaves a remainder when divided by 2 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, the number is odd and is included in the output list.
3. **Output**: The function returns the new list of odd integers, which directly addresses the problem description's requirement to filter odd numbers.

Since the function correctly implements the filtering of odd numbers from the input list and returns the result in the expected format, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is verified as **True**.
