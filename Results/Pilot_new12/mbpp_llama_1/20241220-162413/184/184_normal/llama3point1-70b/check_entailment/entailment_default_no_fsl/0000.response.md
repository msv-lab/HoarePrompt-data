Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The function handles various cases as described in the output hints, including:

1.  **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly returns an empty list when the input list is empty, as there are no odd integers to filter.
2.  **Preserving duplicates**: If the input list contains duplicate integers, the function preserves these duplicates in the output list if they are odd.
3.  **Handling lists with no odd integers**: The function correctly returns an empty list when the input list contains no odd integers.

The problem description and the provided function align well, assuming that the input will always be a valid list of integers. The function's behavior is well-defined for all potential cases where the input list contains only integers. The output hints also align with the function's behavior, providing examples of how the function handles different input scenarios.

Since the problem description assumes valid input (a list of integers), and the function correctly filters odd numbers from such input, the code is correct for all potential cases within the problem's constraints.
