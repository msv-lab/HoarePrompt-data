Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function to filter odd numbers from a given list of integers. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes a number in the output list if it is odd, i.e., `num % 2!= 0`.

The original assessment states that the function is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases, including empty input lists, lists containing only even numbers, lists containing only odd numbers, lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers, and lists containing zero or negative numbers.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`, which aligns with the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code, annotations, and original assessment, we can see that:

1. The function correctly filters odd numbers using the condition `num % 2!= 0`.
2. The function handles various input cases, including empty lists, lists with only even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with a mix of even and odd numbers.
3. The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment, indicating that the function returns a list of odd integers as expected.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
