You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each number `num` in `nums` and includes it in the output list if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`), which is the definition of an odd number.

The function correctly handles various potential cases, including:

- Empty input list: If `nums` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list, which is the expected result since there are no numbers to filter.
- List with only even numbers: If `nums` contains only even numbers, the function will return an empty list, correctly filtering out all the even numbers.
- List with only odd numbers: If `nums` contains only odd numbers, the function will return the original list, since all numbers are odd and should be included.
- List with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function will return a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list, correctly filtering out the even numbers.
- List containing non-integer numbers: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle non-integer numbers, the function will still work correctly as per its mathematical definition. For floating-point numbers, the modulo operation (`%`) will return the remainder of the division, which for odd integer values (represented as floats) will still correctly identify them as odd. However, for non-integer floating-point numbers, their "oddness" or "evenness" is not typically considered in the usual mathematical sense, but the function will apply the modulo operation as defined for floats.

Given these considerations, the program appears to correctly implement a function to filter odd numbers from a list, according to the provided problem description, without any apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list, effectively filtering out all even integers. The input list `nums` remains unchanged. The function handles empty lists and lists with no odd integers by returning an empty list. It also handles lists with duplicate integers by preserving the duplicates in the output list if they are odd. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a list of integers. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function's behavior may be undefined. The function returns a list, which can be empty if the input list contains no odd integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
