The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, which is supported by the problem description and the provided code. The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly filters out even integers from a list of integers, returning a new list containing only the odd integers.

The output hints further confirm the correctness of the program by stating that it:

1. Accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers.
2. Leaves the input list unchanged.
3. Handles empty lists and lists with no odd integers by returning an empty list.
4. Preserves duplicates in the output list if they are odd.

These points align with the expected behavior of a function designed to filter odd numbers from a list.

The original assessment and the output hints both assume that the input will always be a list of integers, which is specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program's lack of error checking on the input type does not affect its correctness in this context.

Given the information available, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. The program meets the problem description, and the output hints support its correctness.

Final: **True**
