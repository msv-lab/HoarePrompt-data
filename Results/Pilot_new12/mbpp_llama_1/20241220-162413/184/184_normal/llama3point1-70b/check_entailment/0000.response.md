Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list, and the condition `num % 2!= 0` checks if the number is odd. If the number is odd, it is included in the output list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty input lists: The function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
- Lists containing only even numbers: The function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
- Lists containing only odd numbers: The function returns the original list, which is the expected result.
- Lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers: The function returns a list containing only the odd numbers, which is the expected result.
- Lists containing zero or negative numbers: The function correctly identifies these numbers as even or odd based on the parity of their absolute value.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible input cases, it is correct.
