#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list, effectively filtering out all even integers. The input list `nums` remains unchanged. The function handles empty lists and lists with no odd integers by returning an empty list. It also handles lists with duplicate integers by preserving the duplicates in the output list if they are odd. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a list of integers. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function's behavior may be undefined. The function returns a list, which can be empty if the input list contains no odd integers.
