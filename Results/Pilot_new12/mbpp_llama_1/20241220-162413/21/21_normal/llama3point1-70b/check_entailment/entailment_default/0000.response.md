Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a given list of numbers. The function description and output hints agree that it returns the smallest number in the list without modifying the input list and assumes the list is not empty. 

The code is correct as it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The `min()` function in Python is designed to find the smallest item in an iterable (like a list) and works correctly for any non-empty list of numbers. The function does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-numeric values, but according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid, i.e., a non-empty list of numbers.

Therefore, given the assumptions that the input list will always be valid (non-empty and containing only numbers), the function `func_1` will always return the smallest number in the list, correctly fulfilling the problem's requirements.
