Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the smallest number in a list, and the provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which directly meets the problem description.

The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the program by describing the state of the program before and after the function call. The annotation states that the input `nums` is a non-empty list of numbers and that the function returns the smallest number in the list without modifying the input list. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment.

One point to note is that the original assessment mentions that the function does not include error checking, which is true. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the program in this context.

The annotated version of the code also mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` exception if the input list is empty and a `TypeError` exception if the list contains non-numeric values. However, as we assume that the input will be valid, these potential errors do not impact the correctness of the program.

Overall, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
