Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which directly meets the problem description of finding the smallest number in a list. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list without modifying the input list. 

The original assessment notes that the function does not include error checking, which could lead to errors if the input is not a list or if the list is empty. However, since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the function with respect to the problem description.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness.

Final: **True**
