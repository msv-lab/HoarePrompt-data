Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. This function directly meets the problem description of finding the smallest number in a list.

The `min` function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Lists with positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate smallest numbers
- Lists with a single element
- Empty lists, although this will raise a `ValueError` as there is no smallest item to return

However, the function does not include error checking, so it will fail if the input is not a list, or if the list is empty. For example, if the input list is empty, `min([])` will raise a `ValueError`. To make the function fully robust, you might want to add error checking to handle such cases.

Despite these edge cases, since the question only asks whether the function meets the problem description for finding the smallest number in a list, and assuming the input is a non-empty list, the function works as expected.
