Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `nums` is a non-empty list of numbers), the program will always work as expected. The `min` function in Python automatically returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list), so it perfectly implements the functionality described in the problem description.

In other words, for any valid input, the program will always return the smallest number in the list, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Therefore, the program is correct.
