To verify the correctness of the given Python function `func_1` based on the provided problem description, we need to check if the function behaves as expected for its intended purpose, which is to find the smallest number in a list.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The annotated program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min()` function.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), let's examine the function's behavior in this context:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description and the annotated program assume the input list is non-empty and contains only numbers. Since we've established that the input will always be valid, this assumption holds.

2. **Finding the Smallest Number**: The function uses the `min()` function, which is a built-in Python function designed to return the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. This perfectly aligns with the problem's requirement to find the smallest number in the list.

3. **Handling of List Contents**: The annotated program mentions that the function will raise exceptions if the list contains non-numeric values or if the list is empty, but these are edge cases that our assumptions about valid input mitigate. For the purposes of this problem, we're focusing on the function's ability to return the smallest number from a list of numbers, which it does correctly.

4. **Modification of the Input List**: The problem description does not specify that the input list must remain unchanged, but the annotated program notes that the function does not modify the input list. This is because the `min()` function does not alter the input iterable; it simply returns the smallest element.

Given these considerations, the function `func_1` behaves exactly as the problem description requires for the assumed valid input scenarios. It finds the smallest number in a list without modifying the list, aligning with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description, assuming valid input is provided. It finds the smallest number in a list efficiently using the `min()` function and does not modify the original list, fulfilling its intended purpose.
