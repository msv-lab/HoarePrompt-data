Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- Lists with positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate numbers
- Lists with a single element
- Lists with zero

The `min` function raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function:

```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]))  # Output: -5
print(func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([0]))  # Output: 0
```

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric elements. If such cases are not considered valid inputs according to the problem description, the function is still correct. But if they are, the function would need to be modified to handle these cases. 

But assuming that the input will always be a non-empty list of numbers, the function works as expected.
