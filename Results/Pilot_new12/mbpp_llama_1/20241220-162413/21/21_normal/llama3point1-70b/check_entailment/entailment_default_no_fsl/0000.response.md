Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a non-empty list of numbers. 

The function utilizes the built-in `min()` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. This satisfies the requirement of the problem.

The output hints indicate potential cases where the function may raise exceptions, such as an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values. However, these cases do not affect the correctness of the function when given a valid input, as stated in the problem description.

Given a valid input, i.e., a non-empty list of numbers, the function will correctly return the smallest number in the list without modifying the original list. Therefore, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, assuming valid input.
