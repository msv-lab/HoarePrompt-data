The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list. It does not modify the input list and assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError exception, as the built-in min() function in Python requires a non-empty sequence. The function does not handle non-numeric values in the list; if the list contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError exception. After the function concludes, the original list remains unchanged, and the smallest number in the list is returned as the result.
