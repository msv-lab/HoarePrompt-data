You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Handling empty lists**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention what to do with an empty list, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is a reasonable behavior.
2. **Handling lists with duplicate minimum values**: The `min()` function will return one of the minimum values, even if there are multiple occurrences of the same minimum value in the list.
3. **Handling lists with negative numbers**: The `min()` function works correctly with negative numbers, as demonstrated by the example `assert func_1([10, 20, -1, 45, 99]) == -1` (not provided in the original examples, but it's a valid test case).
4. **Handling lists with zero**: The `min()` function works correctly with zero, as it is a valid number in the list.

Since we can't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the provided examples all seem to work correctly, the program is correct. The `min()` function is a built-in and well-tested function in Python, and its behavior is well-defined and consistent.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list. If the list contains duplicate minimum values, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the original list. It handles lists with positive, negative, and zero values, as well as lists with a single element. However, it does not handle empty lists, as this would raise a ValueError. The function's return value is the smallest number in the list, or a ValueError if the list is empty. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the original list remains unchanged, and the smallest number in the list is returned as the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
