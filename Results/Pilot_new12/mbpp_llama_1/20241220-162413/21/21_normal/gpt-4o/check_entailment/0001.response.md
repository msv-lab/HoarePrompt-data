Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it uses the built-in Python function `min()` to find the smallest number in the list. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including lists with negative numbers, lists with duplicate smallest numbers, and lists with a single element.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for some example cases. 

Additionally, the function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It will raise a ValueError if the input list is empty, which is the expected behavior. 

For example, if we pass an empty list to the function, it will raise an error: `func_1([])` will raise `ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence`. This behavior is correct according to the problem description, as the smallest number in an empty list is undefined.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
