Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function to find the smallest number in a list, and the given function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function utilizes Python's built-in `min()` function, which returns the smallest item in an iterable (in this case, the list `lst`). This approach ensures that for any non-empty list of numbers, the function will correctly identify and return the smallest number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness by covering various scenarios, including lists with different smallest numbers and lists of varying lengths. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of numbers), the function will consistently return the correct result.

In every potential case, as long as the input is a non-empty list of numbers, `func_1` will return the smallest number in that list, adhering to the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the specified criteria.
