Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Handling empty lists**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention what to do with an empty list, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is a reasonable behavior.
2. **Handling lists with duplicate minimum values**: The `min()` function will return one of the minimum values, even if there are multiple occurrences of the same minimum value in the list.
3. **Handling lists with negative numbers**: The `min()` function works correctly with negative numbers, as demonstrated by the example `assert func_1([10, 20, -1, 45, 99]) == -1` (not provided in the original examples, but it's a valid test case).
4. **Handling lists with zero**: The `min()` function works correctly with zero, as it is a valid number in the list.

Since we can't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the provided examples all seem to work correctly, the program is correct. The `min()` function is a built-in and well-tested function in Python, and its behavior is well-defined and consistent.
