Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return the smallest number in the list. 

The `min()` function in Python is used to find the smallest item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) or the smallest of two or more arguments. In this case, it finds the smallest number in the list `lst`.

The program handles lists with positive, negative, and zero values, as well as lists with a single element. The function does not modify the original list. It also correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate minimum values by returning one of them.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of numbers), the program will always return the smallest number in the list, which aligns with the problem description. The assertions provided also confirm the correctness of the function for various test cases. 

Therefore, since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description under the assumption of valid inputs, it is considered correct.
