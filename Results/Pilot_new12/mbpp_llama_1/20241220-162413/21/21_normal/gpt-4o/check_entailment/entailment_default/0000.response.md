Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the built-in `min()` function in Python to find the smallest number in a list. The function takes a list as input and returns the smallest element in the list. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's ability to handle lists with various minimum values, including lists with duplicate minimum values, lists with a single element, and lists with positive, negative, and zero values.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers, returns the smallest number in the list, and does not modify the original list. Although the hints mention that the function does not handle empty lists, which would raise a ValueError, this is consistent with the problem description, which assumes valid input.

Since the code correctly implements the `min()` function and the output hints align with the code's behavior, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The code handles various scenarios, including lists with multiple elements, single-element lists, and lists with different data types (e.g., positive, negative, and zero values).

Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the code does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or non-list inputs. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
