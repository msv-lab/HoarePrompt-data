Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function works correctly for lists containing positive, negative, and zero values, as well as lists with a single element. It also returns one of the duplicate minimum values if the list contains multiple minimum values.

The program does not handle empty lists, but this is not a requirement according to the problem description. The description and the output hints both explicitly state that the function accepts a non-empty list of numbers.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the program works correctly for all potential cases. The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different input scenarios.

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
