You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it uses the built-in Python function `min()` to find the smallest number in the list. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including lists with negative numbers, lists with duplicate smallest numbers, and lists with a single element.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for some example cases. 

Additionally, the function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It will raise a ValueError if the input list is empty, which is the expected behavior. 

For example, if we pass an empty list to the function, it will raise an error: `func_1([])` will raise `ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence`. This behavior is correct according to the problem description, as the smallest number in an empty list is undefined.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a non-empty list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest number in the list `lst`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
