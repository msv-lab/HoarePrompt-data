The original assessment states that the program is correct because it follows the problem description exactly. The problem requires writing a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list, which the provided function `func_1` does by combining the lists and sorting the combined list.

The output hints provided align with the original assessment and the problem description. They confirm that the function accepts three lists, returns a single sorted list, can handle lists of comparable elements, does not modify the original lists, and includes duplicate elements in the sorted output. The function's behavior regarding error handling, empty lists, and returning a new list object without modifying the originals is also consistent with the problem's requirements, given the assumption of valid input.

Upon review, the code and the original assessment align with the problem description, and the output hints support the correctness of the function's behavior as described. The function is implemented in a way that meets the specified requirements, including handling duplicates, not modifying the original lists, and returning a new sorted list.

Therefore, considering all provided information, the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate.

Final: **True**
