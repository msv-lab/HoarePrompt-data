You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110], [19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154], [24, 26, 54, 48]) == [4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]) == [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12]
assert func_1([18, 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1], [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 25, 58], [12, 74, 9, 50, 61, 41]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 12, 14, 14, 18, 22, 25, 25, 35, 41, 50, 58, 61, 65, 74, 75, 85]

def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list `combined_list`, and then sorts this combined list using the built-in `sorted` function. The resulting sorted list is then returned.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. For instance, the function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, lists with elements in different orders, and lists of varying lengths.

To verify the program's correctness, we can consider several potential edge cases:

1. **Empty lists**: If any of the input lists are empty, the function should still produce a sorted output. For example, `func_1([], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the case.

2. **Duplicate elements**: The function should correctly handle duplicate elements across the different input lists. As shown in the unit tests, the function correctly sorts lists with duplicate elements, such as `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 5, 7], [1, 4, 7])`.

3. **Negative numbers and zero**: The function should correctly handle lists containing negative numbers and zero. For example, `func_1([-1, 0, 1], [-3, -2, 2], [-4, 3, 4])` should return `[-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is the case.

4. **Floating-point numbers**: The function should correctly handle lists containing floating-point numbers. For example, `func_1([1.1, 2.2], [0.1, 3.3], [1.1, 4.4])` should return `[0.1, 1.1, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4]`, which is the case.

Given that the function passes these edge cases and the provided unit tests, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three lists, list1, list2, and list3, and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order. The function can handle lists of comparable elements, such as numbers or strings. It does not modify the original input lists. The function does not perform any error checking on the input lists, so it assumes that they are valid lists that can be concatenated and sorted. If the input lists contain non-comparable elements, the function will raise a TypeError. If the input lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the function will include all duplicates in the sorted output list. The function will return a new list object, leaving the original input lists unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
