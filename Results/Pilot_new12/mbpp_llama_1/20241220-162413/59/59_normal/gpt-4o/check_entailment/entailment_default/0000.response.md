Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges three input lists into a single sorted list. The function first combines the input lists into a single list using the `+` operator and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted` function.

The code aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to accept three lists and return a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order. The function also handles duplicate elements correctly by including all duplicates in the sorted output list.

The output hints provided agree with the code and describe its behavior accurately. The hints mention that the function can handle lists of comparable elements, such as numbers or strings, and that it does not modify the original input lists.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input lists, but this is acceptable since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different lengths. The function returns the expected sorted list for each test case, indicating that it works as expected.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
