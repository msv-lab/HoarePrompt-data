Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, merges them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list without modifying the original input lists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Merging the lists**: The program uses the `+` operator to concatenate the input lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list `combined_list`. This is a straightforward and efficient way to merge the lists.

2. **Sorting the combined list**: The program utilizes the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the `combined_list` in ascending order. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list unchanged.

3. **Returning the sorted list**: The sorted list is then returned by the function. As the `sorted()` function returns a new list, the original input lists remain unmodified.

4. **Handling duplicate elements**: The program includes all duplicates in the sorted output list, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Handling empty lists**: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, the program will correctly return an empty list if the input lists are empty, as the concatenation and sorting operations can handle empty lists.

6. **Assuming valid input**: As specified, we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., lists containing comparable elements). The program does not include error checking for non-comparable elements or non-list inputs, but this is acceptable given the problem constraints.

In summary, the program correctly implements the required functionality, merging three input lists into a single sorted list while leaving the original lists unmodified and handling duplicate elements and empty lists as specified. Therefore, the program's correctness is **True**.
