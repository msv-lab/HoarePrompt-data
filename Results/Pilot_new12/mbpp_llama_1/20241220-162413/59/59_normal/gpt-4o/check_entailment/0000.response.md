Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it follows the problem description exactly. The problem requires writing a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided function, `func_1`, performs this task by first combining the three lists into a single list, `combined_list`, using the `+` operator. Then, it sorts `combined_list` using the built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list.

This approach works for all potential cases, including:

- Lists of different lengths
- Lists containing duplicate elements
- Lists containing a mix of positive and negative numbers (or any other comparable data types)
- Lists that are already sorted or unsorted

The function does not make any assumptions about the input lists, such as their length or whether they are sorted, which makes it robust and correct for all potential cases.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function, showing that it works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, based on the code and the tests, I conclude that the program is correct.
