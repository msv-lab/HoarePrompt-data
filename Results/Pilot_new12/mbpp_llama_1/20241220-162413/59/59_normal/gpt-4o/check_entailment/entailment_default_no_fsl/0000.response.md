Correctness: **True**

The provided code for the function `func_1` correctly merges three input lists into a single sorted list. It achieves this by first concatenating the input lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list containing all elements from the input lists. Then, it sorts the combined list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function and returns the sorted list.

The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases, such as lists containing duplicate elements, empty lists, and lists with non-comparable elements (in which case it raises a `TypeError` as expected). The hints also mention that the function does not modify the original input lists and returns a new list object.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios. Since the function simply concatenates and sorts the input lists, it does not have any apparent edge cases that it fails to handle. As long as the input lists are valid lists of comparable elements, the function should produce the expected output.

Given that the problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list and the provided code accomplishes this task correctly for all potential cases (assuming valid input), the correctness of the code can be confirmed.
