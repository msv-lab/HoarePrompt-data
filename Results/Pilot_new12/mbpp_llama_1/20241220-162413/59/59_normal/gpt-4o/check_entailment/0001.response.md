Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list `combined_list`, and then sorts this combined list using the built-in `sorted` function. The resulting sorted list is then returned.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. For instance, the function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, lists with elements in different orders, and lists of varying lengths.

To verify the program's correctness, we can consider several potential edge cases:

1. **Empty lists**: If any of the input lists are empty, the function should still produce a sorted output. For example, `func_1([], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the case.

2. **Duplicate elements**: The function should correctly handle duplicate elements across the different input lists. As shown in the unit tests, the function correctly sorts lists with duplicate elements, such as `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 5, 7], [1, 4, 7])`.

3. **Negative numbers and zero**: The function should correctly handle lists containing negative numbers and zero. For example, `func_1([-1, 0, 1], [-3, -2, 2], [-4, 3, 4])` should return `[-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is the case.

4. **Floating-point numbers**: The function should correctly handle lists containing floating-point numbers. For example, `func_1([1.1, 2.2], [0.1, 3.3], [1.1, 4.4])` should return `[0.1, 1.1, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4]`, which is the case.

Given that the function passes these edge cases and the provided unit tests, we can conclude that the program is correct.
