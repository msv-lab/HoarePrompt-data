Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes three lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` as input.
2. It combines these three lists into a single list `combined_list` using the `+` operator.
3. The `sorted` function is then used to sort the `combined_list` in ascending order, and the result is stored in `sorted_list`.
4. The `sorted_list` is then returned by the function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios. The function handles lists containing duplicate elements, as well as lists with different lengths. The sorted output is always in ascending order, which meets the problem description's requirements.

In general, the program will work correctly for any valid input (i.e., lists of comparable elements) because it uses the built-in `sorted` function, which is a stable and efficient sorting algorithm in Python. Therefore, the program will always produce the expected output, which is a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.
