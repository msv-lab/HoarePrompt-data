To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given code does. The code sorts the `combined_list` in ascending order and assigns it to the variable `sorted_list`. 

Given that `combined_list` is a list equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`, and `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, the sorting operation will rearrange all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order.

The initial state is:
- `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared.
- `combined_list` is a list equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`.

After executing the code:
- `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code.
- `combined_list` remains equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`, as the code does not alter the original lists or their combination.
- A new variable `sorted_list` is introduced, which is equal to the sorted version of `combined_list`, thus equal to the sorted version of `list1 + list2 + list3`.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, `combined_list` is a list equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`, and `sorted_list` is a list equal to the sorted version of `list1 + list2 + list3`.**
