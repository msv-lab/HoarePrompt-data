The code `return sorted_list` implies that the program will return the `sorted_list` variable. From the initial state, we know that `sorted_list` is a list equal to the sorted version of `list1 + list2 + list3`. This means `sorted_list` contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, combined into one list and sorted.

Given that `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, the sorted version will arrange these elements in ascending order (or another specified order, but typically ascending by default).

Output State: **The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, in ascending order.**
