The code combines `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a new list called `combined_list`. The previous values of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are not affected, so they remain lists of elements that can be compared.

`combined_list` is assigned the value of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. This means `combined_list` will contain all elements from `list1`, followed by all elements from `list2`, and then all elements from `list3`.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, `combined_list` is a list equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`**
