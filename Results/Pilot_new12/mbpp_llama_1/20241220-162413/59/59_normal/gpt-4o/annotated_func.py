#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as numbers or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists, list1, list2, and list3, and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order. The function can handle lists of comparable elements, such as numbers or strings. It does not modify the original input lists. The function does not perform any error checking on the input lists, so it assumes that they are valid lists that can be concatenated and sorted. If the input lists contain non-comparable elements, the function will raise a TypeError. If the input lists are empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the function will include all duplicates in the sorted output list. The function will return a new list object, leaving the original input lists unchanged.
