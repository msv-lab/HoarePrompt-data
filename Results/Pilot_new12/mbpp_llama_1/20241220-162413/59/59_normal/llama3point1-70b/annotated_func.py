#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as numbers or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3, in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements, and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original input lists. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type, such as numbers or strings. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the resulting sorted list will also contain these duplicates. If the input lists are empty, the function returns an empty list. The original input lists remain unchanged throughout the execution of the function.
