You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function to achieve this. 

The function works as follows:
1. It concatenates the three input lists into one using the `+` operator.
2. It sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function.
3. It returns the sorted list.

This function works correctly for every potential case. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and lists containing duplicate elements. It also handles lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as integers and floats.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8])`, the function will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is the correct sorted list.

The function does not have any limitations or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as numbers or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3, in ascending order.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
