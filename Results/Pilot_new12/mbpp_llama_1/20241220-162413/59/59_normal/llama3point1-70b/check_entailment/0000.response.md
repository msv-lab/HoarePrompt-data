Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function to achieve this. 

The function works as follows:
1. It concatenates the three input lists into one using the `+` operator.
2. It sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function.
3. It returns the sorted list.

This function works correctly for every potential case. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and lists containing duplicate elements. It also handles lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as integers and floats.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8])`, the function will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is the correct sorted list.

The function does not have any limitations or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
