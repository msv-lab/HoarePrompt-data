Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. The function returns the sorted list without modifying the original input lists.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as expected. It accepts three lists of comparable elements, concatenates them, sorts the resulting list, and returns the sorted list in ascending order. The annotations also note that the function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function works correctly for every potential case, including lists with duplicate elements and empty lists. It also notes that the function does not have any limitations or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the original assessment, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
