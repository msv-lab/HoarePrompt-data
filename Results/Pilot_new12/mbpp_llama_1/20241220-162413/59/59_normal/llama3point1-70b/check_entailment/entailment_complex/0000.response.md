To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, combines them into one list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function. The sorted list is then returned as the result.

Here are the key aspects of the program's behavior as described in the annotations:

1. **Input handling**: The function accepts three parameters, which are lists of comparable elements (such as numbers or strings). It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type.

2. **Sorting and duplicates**: The function returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order. It does not remove duplicates, so if the input lists contain duplicate elements, the resulting sorted list will also contain these duplicates.

3. **Preservation of original lists**: The function does not modify the original input lists. It returns a new list that is a sorted combination of the input lists, leaving the original lists unchanged.

Given these aspects, we can assess the program's correctness based on the problem description.

**Why the program is correct**:
- The program merges three lists into a single list by using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists.
- It sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function, which arranges the elements in ascending order.
- It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type without needing explicit error handling for these cases, as per the assumption that the input will be valid.
- It preserves the original lists by creating and returning a new sorted list, rather than modifying the input lists in place.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the assumptions provided (valid input, no error handling required for invalid inputs like non-lists or non-comparable elements), the program always does what the problem description asks for.

Correctness: **True**
