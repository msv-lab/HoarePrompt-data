You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it merges three lists into a single sorted list as described in the problem. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

* The `+` operator concatenates the three input lists into a single list.
* The `sorted` function sorts the concatenated list in ascending order.
* The function returns the sorted list.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the `+` operator and `sorted` function will still work correctly.
* Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements in the input lists, the `sorted` function will preserve the duplicates in the sorted list.
* Negative numbers: If the input lists contain negative numbers, the `sorted` function will sort them correctly.
* Mixed data types: However, if the input lists contain mixed data types (e.g., strings and integers), the `sorted` function may raise a TypeError. But this is a limitation of the problem description, as it does not specify how to handle mixed data types.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements, and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original input lists. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type, such as numbers or strings. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the resulting sorted list will also contain these duplicates. If the input lists are empty, the function returns an empty list. The original input lists remain unchanged throughout the execution of the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
