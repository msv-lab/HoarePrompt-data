Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it merges three lists into a single sorted list as described in the problem. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

* The `+` operator concatenates the three input lists into a single list.
* The `sorted` function sorts the concatenated list in ascending order.
* The function returns the sorted list.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the `+` operator and `sorted` function will still work correctly.
* Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements in the input lists, the `sorted` function will preserve the duplicates in the sorted list.
* Negative numbers: If the input lists contain negative numbers, the `sorted` function will sort them correctly.
* Mixed data types: However, if the input lists contain mixed data types (e.g., strings and integers), the `sorted` function may raise a TypeError. But this is a limitation of the problem description, as it does not specify how to handle mixed data types.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
