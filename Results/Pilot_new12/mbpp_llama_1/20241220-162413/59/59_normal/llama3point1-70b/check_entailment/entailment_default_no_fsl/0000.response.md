Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) into a single sorted list. The function uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to achieve this. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling lists of any length**: The code can handle lists of any length because it uses the `+` operator to concatenate the lists and then sorts the resulting list. This operation is valid for lists of any length, including empty lists.

2. **Supporting elements of any comparable data type**: The `sorted` function in Python can sort lists containing elements of any comparable data type, such as numbers or strings. This is because these data types implement comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.), which are used by the `sorted` function to determine the order of elements.

3. **Preserving duplicates**: The code preserves duplicate elements from the input lists because the `sorted` function is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved.

4. **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly handles empty lists as input. When all input lists are empty, the function returns an empty list, as expected.

5. **Not modifying the original input lists**: The code does not modify the original input lists because it creates a new list by concatenating the input lists and then sorts this new list. The input lists remain unchanged throughout the execution of the function.

Overall, the provided code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
