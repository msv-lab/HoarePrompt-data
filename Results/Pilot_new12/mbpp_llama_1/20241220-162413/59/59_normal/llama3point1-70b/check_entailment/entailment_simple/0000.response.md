Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

1. The function takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input.
2. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate these lists into a single list.
3. The `sorted` function is then applied to this concatenated list, which sorts its elements in ascending order.
4. The sorted list is returned as the result.

This implementation meets the problem description's requirements:

* It merges the three input lists into a single list.
* The resulting list is sorted in ascending order.
* The function can handle lists containing elements that can be compared, such as numbers or strings.

Since the problem description assumes valid input, we don't need to consider cases where the input lists are empty or contain non-comparable elements. For all valid input cases, the function will correctly merge and sort the three lists. Therefore, the program is correct, and it always does what the problem description says.
