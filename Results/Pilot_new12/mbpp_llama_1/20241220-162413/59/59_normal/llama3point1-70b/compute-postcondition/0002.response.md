Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements, and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original input lists. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and supports elements of any comparable data type, such as numbers or strings. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the resulting sorted list will also contain these duplicates. If the input lists are empty, the function returns an empty list. The original input lists remain unchanged throughout the execution of the function.**
