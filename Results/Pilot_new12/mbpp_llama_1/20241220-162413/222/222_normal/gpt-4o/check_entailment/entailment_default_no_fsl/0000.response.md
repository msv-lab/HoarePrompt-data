Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. For example, if the input string is 'aBc', the function should return 'B' because 'a' and 'c' are lowercase characters that are part of a substring, but if the input string is 'Bac', the function should return 'B' as well. However, the function will return 'B' in both cases which seems correct but in the case of 'aBc' it should be 'B' and in the case 'abc' it should be an empty string. But let's consider another case where the input string is 'abcde', the function will return an empty string which seems correct, however, if the input string is 'Abcde', the function should return 'A', which it does, but in the case of 'abcdeB', it should return 'B', which it also does. However the issue is that the current implementation does not remove lowercase substrings, it just removes all lowercase characters.

A correct implementation should iterate through the string, identify substrings that consist only of lowercase letters, and remove those substrings. The current implementation does not meet this requirement. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly: 
If we have a string with two substrings of lowercase letters separated by an uppercase letter, the function should remove the two substrings of lowercase letters. For example, if the input string is 'aBa', the function should return 'B', because both 'a's are part of a substring of lowercase letters. However, the function will return 'B' which is correct but for a different reason, it simply removes all lowercase characters. 

Another example is the string 'PYTHon', the function will return 'PYTH' which is correct, because 'on' is a substring of lowercase letters, but if we consider the string 'PYthOn', the function will return 'PYOn' which is correct but the function does not preserve the order of uppercase letters if there were other uppercase letters after 'On', it simply removes all lowercase characters, which is different from removing substrings of lowercase characters. 

In conclusion, the function is not correct because it removes all lowercase characters instead of removing substrings of lowercase characters. It seems to work correctly in some cases, but that is because the removal of all lowercase characters happens to coincide with the removal of substrings of lowercase characters in those cases. However, this is not the same as actually removing substrings of lowercase characters. 

Here's an example of how the correct function could be implemented:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].isupper():
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            while i < len(s) and s[i].islower():
                i += 1
    return result
```
This function iterates through the string, adding uppercase characters to the result and skipping over substrings of lowercase characters. This implementation meets the problem description's requirements.
