Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters removed. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and it includes a character in the output string only if the character is uppercase (i.e., `char.isupper()` returns `True`).

The program correctly follows the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, it's worth noting that the problem description and the provided unit tests suggest that the intention is to remove individual lowercase characters, not substrings. In this interpretation, the program is correct.

The function works by iterating over the input string character by character, checking if each character is uppercase, and including it in the output string if it is. This approach ensures that all lowercase characters are removed from the output string, regardless of their position or the surrounding characters.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples, including strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters. Since the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description and the unit tests, and it correctly handles all potential cases, the program is correct.
