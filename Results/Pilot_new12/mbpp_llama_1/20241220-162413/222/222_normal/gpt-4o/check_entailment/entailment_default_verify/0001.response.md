Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it seems that the intention is to remove individual lowercase characters, not substrings. 

The provided code correctly implements this interpretation by iterating over the input string character by character and including only the uppercase characters in the output string. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the input string, preserving their original order.

The original assessment is accurate because it takes into account the provided unit tests, which demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples, including strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters. The output hints provide additional evidence that the function behaves as intended, handling various cases such as empty strings, strings with no uppercase characters, and strings with non-alphabet characters.

While the problem description could be interpreted as asking to remove sequences of lowercase characters, the provided code, unit tests, and output hints suggest that the intention is to remove individual lowercase characters. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the provided information.

Final: **True**
