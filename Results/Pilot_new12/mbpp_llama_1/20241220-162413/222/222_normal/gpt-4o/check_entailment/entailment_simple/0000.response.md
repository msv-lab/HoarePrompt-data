To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we must determine if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description: removing lowercase substrings from a given string.

The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`, effectively removing any lowercase characters (which could be considered as forming lowercase substrings when together).

The key line in the function is:
```python
return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```
This line uses a list comprehension to filter out characters from string `s` that are not uppercase (`char.isupper()` returns `True` if the character is uppercase, `False` otherwise). It then joins these uppercase characters back into a string.

Given the problem description, the goal is to remove lowercase substrings. The function `func_1` achieves this by removing all lowercase characters, which can be considered a valid interpretation of removing lowercase substrings since any sequence of lowercase characters (which could form a substring) is eliminated from the output.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, and `assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`, demonstrate the function's behavior in specific scenarios and match the expectation of removing lowercase characters.

**Correctness: True**

This conclusion is drawn because the function behaves as intended according to the problem description for the provided test cases and under the assumption of valid input (i.e., no handling is needed for potential errors such as `None` or non-string inputs). The function removes lowercase characters, which aligns with the goal of removing lowercase substrings when considering any sequence of lowercase characters as a substring.
