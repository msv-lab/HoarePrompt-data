Correctness: **False**

The given Python function `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. It simply removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. For example, if the input string is 'abABCc', the function will return 'ABC' instead of the expected 'ABCc' because 'ab' and 'c' are substrings that contain lowercase characters.

A correct implementation would need to identify and remove continuous sequences of lowercase characters, not individual characters. The current function does not handle this correctly, as it does not consider the context of the characters (i.e., whether they are part of a substring or not). Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
