Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program only removes individual lowercase characters. 

For example, if the input is 'aBCde', the program will return 'BC' which is correct, but if the input is 'abcBC', the program will also return 'BC', which is correct. However, if the input is 'aBcDEf', the program will return 'BDEF', which seems correct but does not prove that it does what the problem description says, which is to remove lowercase substrings.

The issue arises when considering the definition of "substring". A substring can be any sequence of characters within the string, not just individual characters. Therefore, the correct output for 'aBcDEf' should be 'BDEf', not 'BDEF', if we are considering 'c' as part of a substring 'BcDEf' where 'BcD' or 'cDE' are substrings.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description: if the input is 'abBC', the program will return 'BC', which is correct but does not demonstrate that the program removes lowercase substrings from the input string.

However, another case is if the input is 'aBCdE', the program will return 'BCE'. The problem description asks for removing lowercase substrings, which in this case would mean removing 'a' and 'd' if 'a' and 'd' are not part of any larger substring, or removing 'aBCd' if 'aBCd' is considered the substring.

To truly follow the problem description, the program should be able to identify and remove all sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual characters. 

The correct Python function to achieve this would be:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    temp = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            temp += char
        else:
            if temp:
                temp = ''
            result += char
    return result
```
This function goes through each character in the string. If it encounters a lowercase character, it adds it to a temporary string. If it encounters an uppercase character, it clears the temporary string and adds the uppercase character to the result string. This way, it effectively removes all sequences of lowercase characters from the string. 

Therefore, the provided program does not always do what the problem description says, making it incorrect.
