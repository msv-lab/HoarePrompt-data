You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters removed. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and it includes a character in the output string only if the character is uppercase (i.e., `char.isupper()` returns `True`).

The program correctly follows the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, it's worth noting that the problem description and the provided unit tests suggest that the intention is to remove individual lowercase characters, not substrings. In this interpretation, the program is correct.

The function works by iterating over the input string character by character, checking if each character is uppercase, and including it in the output string if it is. This approach ensures that all lowercase characters are removed from the output string, regardless of their position or the surrounding characters.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples, including strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters. Since the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description and the unit tests, and it correctly handles all potential cases, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the input string `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string. If the input string `s` contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, the function returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`, preserving their original order. The function does not modify the original string `s` and has no side effects. The function handles strings with non-alphabet characters, returning only the uppercase letters and ignoring any non-alphabet characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
