Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string `s`. If `char` is an uppercase character, then `result` is a string equal to the first character of `s`. Since there is no else part, if `char` is not an uppercase character, the state of `result` remains unchanged as an empty string.***
