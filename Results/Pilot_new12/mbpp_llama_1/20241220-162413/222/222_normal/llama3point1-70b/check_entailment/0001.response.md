Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The problem description asks for the removal of lowercase substrings, but the provided code only removes lowercase characters, not substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HW" because "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings that should be removed. However, the provided program will return "HW" which is correct in this case. But if the input string is "Hello world", the expected output should be "H W", but the provided program will return "H W" which is also correct in this case. 

However, the problem arises when we consider the program's behavior with a string that contains non-alphabetic characters. For instance, if the input string is "Hello, world!", the expected output should be "H,!", but the provided program will correctly return "H,!". But this program does not handle the case where the input string is "abAB" which is a string with lowercase and uppercase characters. In this case, the program will return "AB", which seems correct, but it does not correctly remove the lowercase substring "ab".

However, the case that really makes the code incorrect is when the input string is "abcABC", the expected output should be "ABC" because "abc" is a lowercase substring that should be removed. However, this code is actually designed to remove individual lowercase characters, not substrings, so in cases where a string contains a mix of lowercase characters and uppercase characters, it may not behave as expected.

But a clear example where this program fails is when the problem description says to remove "all lowercase characters from the string that are part of a lowercase substring" the program does not correctly implement it. It simply removes all lowercase characters. So the correct approach should be to identify all the lowercase substrings and then remove them from the string, not just remove the lowercase characters. 

For instance, in the string "aBc", "a" and "c" are part of a lowercase substring and an uppercase character "B", so they should be kept or removed based on the definition of a substring. But "abc" is a substring that should be removed completely as per the problem description if it is all lowercase characters. But "aBc" has both lowercase and uppercase characters so "B" should be kept according to the problem description that asks to remove lowercase substrings.

Therefore, this code does not correctly implement the problem description, because it simply removes all lowercase characters instead of identifying and removing all lowercase substrings. 

A correct approach would involve iterating over the string and checking for substrings that are entirely lowercase, then removing those. The current implementation does not do this and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

So the program does not meet the requirements for all the possible inputs according to the problem description and is therefore **False**.
