Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly implement the problem description to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The current implementation only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "aBcDe", the expected output should be "BDE", but the function will return "BDE", which is correct in this case, but this is not the case for other inputs. 

However, if the input string is "abcB", the function will correctly return "B". But if the input is "aBcdE", the expected output should be "BE", but the function will also return "BE", which is correct.

But the main issue here is the understanding of the term "substrings". A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The function does not remove the substrings, it just removes the lowercase characters.

To correctly implement the function, it should iterate over all substrings of the input string, check if they are lowercase, and if so, remove them from the string. However, this is not what the current implementation does.

A correct implementation would require a more complex approach, possibly using a loop to generate all substrings, checking each one, and then removing it if it's lowercase. 

In the current implementation, it just checks each character individually and removes it if it's lowercase, which does not fulfill the problem description of removing lowercase substrings. 

Therefore, the code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case.
