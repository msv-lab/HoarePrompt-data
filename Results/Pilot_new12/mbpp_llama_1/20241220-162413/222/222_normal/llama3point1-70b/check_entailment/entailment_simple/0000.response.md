Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, a more accurate interpretation of the problem description would be to remove all lowercase characters from the string, since substrings can be of any length and the problem does not specify how to handle substrings of length greater than 1.

The program iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is uppercase (checked using the `isupper()` method), it is added to the `result` string. This effectively removes all lowercase characters from the string, since only uppercase characters are included in the `result`.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which is the string with all lowercase characters removed. This matches the expected output based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the function to remove lowercase characters (or equivalently, lowercase substrings of length 1) from a given string, and it will produce the correct output for all valid input strings.
