Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The provided program accomplishes this by iterating over each character in the string and adding it to the result only if it is an uppercase character. This effectively removes all lowercase characters (regardless of whether they form substrings or are individual characters) from the string, leaving only the uppercase characters in their original order.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:
- If the input string is empty, it returns an empty string.
- If the input string contains no uppercase characters, it returns an empty string.
- If the input string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, it returns a string containing only the uppercase characters in their original order.
- If the input string contains only uppercase characters, it returns the original string.
- If the input string contains only lowercase characters, it returns an empty string.

The program does not explicitly check for or handle the case of substrings, but its functionality of filtering out individual lowercase characters inherently fulfills the requirement of removing lowercase substrings because any sequence of lowercase characters (which would constitute a lowercase substring) will be completely excluded from the result.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.
