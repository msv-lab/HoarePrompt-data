Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem description. The problem asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided function removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "aBCd". The function will return "BC", but it should return "BCd" because "d" is not part of a lowercase substring. 

The function does not correctly handle the removal of lowercase substrings. Instead, it removes all lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is "abcDEFgh", the function will return "DEF", but it should return "DEF" if we consider the whole string as a substring or "DEFgh" if we don't consider "gh" as a lowercase substring since the problem description is not clear about this case. 

However, in the general case a substring is a sequence of characters within a string, so in the case of the string "abcDEFgh", "abc" and "gh" are indeed substrings and the function should return "DEF" since it has to remove all the lowercase substrings.

So the correct program should identify sequences of one or more lowercase characters and remove them from the string. 

The provided function does not achieve this, it simply filters out all the lowercase characters. 

The correct implementation should be something like this:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            while i < len(s) and s[i].islower():
                i += 1
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```
