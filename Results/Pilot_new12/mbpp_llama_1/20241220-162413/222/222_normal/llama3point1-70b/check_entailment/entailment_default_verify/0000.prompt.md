You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. The program simply iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is uppercase. If it is, the character is added to the result string. This approach does not consider substrings as a whole, but rather individual characters.

For example, if the input string is "aBcDe", the program will return "BDE", which is correct. However, if the input string is "abcdef", the program will return an empty string, which is also correct. But, if the input string is "AbcDef", the program will return "AD", which is correct. 

However, the main issue with this function is that it doesn't handle the case where a substring is all lowercase and is followed by an uppercase character. In such cases, it correctly removes the lowercase substring.

But, the major flaw in this approach is that it is considering each character separately and not the entire substring. For, instance "abc" is a substring and it should be completely removed from the string if it is all lowercase. The function correctly does this.

However, the problem arises when we think about what the problem is actually asking. The function should remove "all lowercase substrings". The current implementation does this. But it does so by removing all lowercase characters which in turn removes all lowercase substrings because a lowercase substring must consist of only lowercase characters.

So one potential problem with this function is that it doesn't handle the case where a string has two separate lowercase substrings, each separated by one or more uppercase characters. But, the function actually does handle this case correctly.

One case where this function does work as expected is when the input string is "abcABCdef". In this case, the function returns "ABC", which is the correct result because "abc" and "def" are both all lowercase substrings and are therefore removed from the string.

However, a more convincing example where the function does work correctly is the string "abXYcd". Here, "ab" and "cd" are both all lowercase substrings. When we run this string through the function, we get "XY", which is the expected result because all lowercase substrings were removed.

But, after carefully considering all possible edge cases and examples, it turns out that this function actually is doing what the problem description says it should do, even though at first glance, it may seem like it is not. The function is supposed to remove "all lowercase substrings" which it does, albeit indirectly, by removing all lowercase characters, because a substring is all lowercase if and only if all of its characters are lowercase.

Actually, this function works perfectly fine and does exactly what the problem asks for: to remove all the characters that are part of a lowercase substring, which, in this implementation, is done by removing all lowercase characters because they, by definition, must be part of a lowercase substring if the string has one.

Upon closer inspection of the code and after carefully considering the definition of a "lowercase substring", it turns out that this code actually does what the problem asks it to. 

One convincing test is if we feed it a string like "AbCdefGhIjklMn". In this case, the function correctly returns "ACGM", which is all the uppercase characters, thus all the characters that are not part of a lowercase substring, which, according to the problem, should be the output of the function.

After exhaustively thinking about potential counterexamples and testing the function on various inputs, it turns out that this function works perfectly and meets the requirements specified by the problem description.

However, the initial assessment was that the function was **False** but after careful consideration of what a "lowercase substring" actually means and what the function does, we can actually conclude that the function actually does meet the requirements. Thus the assessment was changed from **False** to **True**.

Correctness: **True**. 

This function does meet the requirements because it removes all characters that are part of a lowercase substring, which, indirectly, means it removes all lowercase substrings because if a substring has all lowercase characters, it is, by definition, a lowercase substring. 

The reason why this function actually does work as expected and meets the problem requirements is because removing all lowercase characters indirectly removes all lowercase substrings because if a substring has all lowercase characters, then all its characters are lowercase and they are all removed by the function. Thus, the function works as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s` in their original order. It does not modify the original string `s`. If the input string `s` is empty, the function will return an empty string. If the input string `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. The function handles all possible edge cases, including strings with only lowercase characters, strings with only uppercase characters, strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, and empty strings, by returning a string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`, in their original order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
