Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately counts the occurrences of all elements from the list 'elements' in the tuple 'tup'. 

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input.
- It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. This is done by calling the `count` method on `tup` for each `element` in `elements`, effectively summing up all the counts.
- The `count` method of a tuple returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple, which directly addresses the problem's requirement.
- The use of `sum` then adds up these individual counts, providing the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.

Given that we assume valid input (i.e., `tup` is a tuple and `elements` is a list, and there are no concerns about duplicate elements within `elements` or handling of empty inputs since these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the problem description as being problematic), the function behaves as specified by the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints. 

The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) further validate this correctness by checking the function's output against expected results for different inputs, ensuring that it behaves correctly across various scenarios.
