Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's why:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list.
2. For each element, it uses the `count` method of the tuple to get the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
3. The `sum` function is then used to add up all these counts.

This approach ensures that every element in the list is counted correctly, regardless of its frequency in the tuple. The test cases provided also demonstrate the function's correctness.

The function handles various scenarios, including:

- Multiple occurrences of the same element in the tuple.
- Elements in the list that do not occur in the tuple (in which case their count would be 0, but since they're not explicitly counted, the sum simply doesn't include them, effectively ignoring them as intended).
- Empty lists or tuples, which would work as expected because the sum of an empty iterable is 0.

Without a specific case where the function fails to meet the problem description, and given the general correctness of its logic, the program is considered correct.
