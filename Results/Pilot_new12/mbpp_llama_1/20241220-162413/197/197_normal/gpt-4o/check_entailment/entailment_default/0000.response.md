Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples to count the occurrences of each element from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the total count of all elements.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- When the tuple `tup` and the list `elements` may contain duplicate elements.
- When the list `elements` may be empty or the tuple `tup` may not contain any elements from the list `elements`, in which case it returns a count of 0.
- When the tuple `tup` and the list `elements` contain different data types, such as strings and integers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

Overall, the function `func_1` accurately implements the described behavior, and it should work correctly for every potential case, assuming valid input is provided.
