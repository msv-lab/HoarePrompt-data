Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list `elements` and sums up the counts of each element in the tuple `tup` using the `count` method.

The function correctly handles cases where the tuple `tup` and the list `elements` may contain duplicate elements, and it counts each occurrence correctly. It also handles cases where the list `elements` may be empty or the tuple `tup` may not contain any elements from the list `elements`, in which case it returns a count of 0.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios. For example, in the first test case, the function correctly returns 3, which is the total count of occurrences of 'a' and 'b' in the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')`.

The problem description requires a Python function to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple, and the function `func_1` meets this requirement by correctly counting and returning the total occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`.

Overall, the function is correct and accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.
