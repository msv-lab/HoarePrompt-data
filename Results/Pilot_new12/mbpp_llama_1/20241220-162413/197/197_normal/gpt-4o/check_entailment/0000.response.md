Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple and then sums them up. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any input tuple and list of elements.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of each element in the list. This method returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

2. The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in elements)` generates a sequence of counts, one for each element in the list.

3. The `sum` function adds up these counts to give the total number of occurrences of all elements in the tuple.

The function is also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the tuple and m is the length of the list of elements. This is because the `count` method has to scan the entire tuple for each element in the list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the function is correct for all potential cases.
