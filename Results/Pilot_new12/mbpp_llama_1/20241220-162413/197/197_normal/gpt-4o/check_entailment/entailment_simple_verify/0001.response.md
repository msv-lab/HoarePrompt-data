The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's why:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list.
2. For each element, it uses the `count` method of the tuple to get the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
3. The `sum` function is then used to add up all these counts.

The annotated version of the code supports this reasoning. Before the function call, `tup` is a tuple and `elements` is a list, which matches the problem description. The function then calculates the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup` and returns this count.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function handles various scenarios, including multiple occurrences of the same element in the tuple, elements in the list that do not occur in the tuple, and empty lists or tuples.

The test cases provided also demonstrate the function's correctness. For example, in the first test case, the tuple is `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list is `['a', 'b']`. The function correctly counts the occurrences of 'a' (2) and 'b' (1) and returns a total count of 3.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
