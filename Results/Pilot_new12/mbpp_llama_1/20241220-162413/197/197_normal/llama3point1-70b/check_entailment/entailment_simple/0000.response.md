Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description because it only returns the total count of all elements from the list that are found in the tuple, not the occurrence of each individual element.

The problem description asks to "count the occurrence of all elements of list in a tuple", which implies that the function should return a count for each element in the list, not a single total count. 

For example, if the input is `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3, 4]`, the function should return something like `{2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 0}` or a similar data structure that shows the count of each element from the list in the tuple. 

The current function would return `5`, which is the total count of `2` and `3` in the tuple, but does not provide any information about the count of each individual element.

To correct this, the function could be modified to return a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list and the values are their respective counts in the tuple. 

Here is an example of how the corrected function could look:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```
