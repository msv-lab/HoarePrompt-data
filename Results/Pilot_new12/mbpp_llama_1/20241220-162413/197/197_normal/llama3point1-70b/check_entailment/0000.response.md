Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list.
- For each element in the list, it uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these counts to give the total occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:
- When the list is empty, the function correctly returns 0, because the generator expression doesn't generate any values to sum.
- When the tuple is empty, the function also correctly returns 0, because `tup.count(element)` will be 0 for all elements in the list.
- When there are duplicate elements in the list, the function correctly counts each element in the list separately, so duplicates in the list will not affect the count.
- When there are no elements in the list that are present in the tuple, the function correctly returns 0.

Overall, the function meets the requirements in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
