Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(tup, lst)` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input, and returns the total count of all elements of `lst` in `tup`.

Here's how it works:

- The `count` method of the tuple `tup` is used to count the occurrences of each element from `lst`.
- A generator expression is used to iterate over each element in `lst` and count its occurrences in `tup`.
- The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total count of all elements of `lst` in `tup`.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3]`, the function will return `5` because the element `2` occurs twice and the element `3` occurs three times in `tup`.

This program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- When `tup` and `lst` are empty.
- When `tup` and `lst` contain duplicate elements.
- When `tup` and `lst` contain different types of elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
