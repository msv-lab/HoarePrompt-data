Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input and returns the total count of elements from `lst` that are found in `tup`. 

The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst` and count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method. This approach correctly handles cases where `tup` and `lst` may be empty, or where elements in `lst` may not be found in `tup`.

As per the problem description, the function should count the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. The code achieves this by counting each element from `lst` as many times as it appears in `lst`, as long as it is present in `tup`.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the total count of elements from `lst` that are found in `tup` and handles various cases, including empty inputs and elements not found in `tup`. 

Since the function correctly implements the required behavior as per the problem description and the output hints, and assuming valid input is provided, the code is considered correct for every potential case.
