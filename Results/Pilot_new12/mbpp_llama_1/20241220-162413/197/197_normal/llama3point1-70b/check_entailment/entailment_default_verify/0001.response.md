Based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from `lst` in `tup`. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst`, count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method, and then sums up these counts to give the total count.

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior, including its handling of empty inputs, duplicate elements, and cases where elements in `lst` may not be found in `tup`. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the original inputs and does not handle potential edge cases such as non-hashable types in `tup` or `lst`.

However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's limitations mentioned in the output hints do not affect its correctness. The function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the provided examples demonstrate its correct behavior.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
