Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to "count the occurrence of all elements of list in a tuple." However, the provided function counts the total occurrences of all elements from the list that appear in the tuple. It does not return the occurrences of each element individually.

To illustrate the difference, consider a tuple `(1, 2, 2, 3)` and a list `[2, 3, 3]`. The function would return `4`, which is the total count of occurrences of elements from the list in the tuple (2 appears twice in the tuple and once in the list, and 3 appears once in the tuple and twice in the list). However, the correct output according to the problem description should be a count for each element in the list, not a total count.

For example, the correct output could be `{2: 2, 3: 1}`, indicating that the element `2` from the list appears twice in the tuple, and the element `3` from the list appears once in the tuple.

The given function does not provide this level of detail and thus does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here is a corrected version of the function in Python:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    result = {}
    for element in lst:
        result[element] = tup.count(element)
    return result
```

This version of the function returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list and the values are their respective counts in the tuple, thus meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
