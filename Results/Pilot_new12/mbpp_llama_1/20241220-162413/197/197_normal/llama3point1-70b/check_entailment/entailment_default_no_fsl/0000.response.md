Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters and returns the total count of elements from `lst` that are found in `tup`. The function does this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst`, counting its occurrences in `tup` with the `count` method.

The function handles cases where `tup` and `lst` may be empty, or where elements in `lst` may not be found in `tup`, because the `count` method returns 0 for elements not found in `tup`, and `sum` returns 0 when the iterable is empty.

For every potential case where the input is valid (i.e., `tup` is indeed a tuple and `lst` is a list, with no restrictions on their contents), this function will accurately count the occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`. The function is designed to work under the assumption that the inputs are of the expected types and does not handle potential edge cases such as non-hashable types or inputs not of the expected types, but as per the instructions, we assume the input will always be valid.

The function's behavior aligns with the problem description: it counts the occurrences of all elements in `lst` that are present in `tup`, handling repetitions in `lst` correctly by counting each occurrence individually as long as the element is present in `tup`. Since the task explicitly mentions assuming valid input, the function's lack of error handling for non-compliant inputs does not detract from its correctness in this context.
