#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of elements from list `lst` that are found in tuple `tup`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters and returns the total count of elements from `lst` that are found in `tup`. The function handles cases where `tup` and `lst` may be empty, or where elements in `lst` may not be found in `tup`. If an element appears multiple times in `lst` but is present in `tup`, it will be counted each time it appears in `lst` as long as it is present in `tup`. The function does not modify the original `tup` or `lst` and does not handle potential edge cases such as non-hashable types in `tup` or `lst`, or cases where `tup` or `lst` are not of the expected types. The function returns an integer representing the total count.
