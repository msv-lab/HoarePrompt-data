To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet: `return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)`. 

Here, `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list. The code counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup` and then sums up these counts.

Since `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list, and the code iterates over each element in `lst` to count its occurrences in `tup`, the return value will be the total count of elements from `lst` that are found in `tup`.

Output State: **The program returns the total count of elements from list `lst` that are found in tuple `tup`.**
