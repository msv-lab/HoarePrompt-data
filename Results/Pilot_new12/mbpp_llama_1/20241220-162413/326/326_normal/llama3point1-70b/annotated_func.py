#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `min_diff` is positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, and returns the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity. The integer `target` does not affect the function's behavior. The function's output is the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list, which can be used to determine the closest pair of consecutive numbers in the list. The function handles edge cases where the input list `arr` has less than 2 elements, in which case it returns positive infinity.
