To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `i` is 1.

The given code is:
```python
diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
```

When `i` is 1, `arr[i]` refers to the second element in the list `arr`, and `arr[i + 1]` refers to the third element in the list `arr`.

Since `arr` is a sorted list, the difference between any two adjacent elements will be a non-negative integer, because `abs` function returns the absolute value of the difference.

Given that `i` is 1, the code calculates the absolute difference between the second and the third elements of `arr` and assigns this difference to the variable `diff`.

The states of `arr`, `target`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the second and the third elements of `arr`, which can be expressed as `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`**
