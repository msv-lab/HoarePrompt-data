The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`arr` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is still an integer, `i` is still 1, and `diff` is still `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. 
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `min_diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`**
