To calculate the result, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- Initially, `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`.
- The current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`.

Given the code `min_diff = diff`, we understand that `min_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`, which is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `target` remains an integer.
- `min_diff` is now equal to `diff`, which is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`.
- `i` is still 0.
- `diff` remains the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, which is now equal to `min_diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` equals the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 0, `diff` equals the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`**
