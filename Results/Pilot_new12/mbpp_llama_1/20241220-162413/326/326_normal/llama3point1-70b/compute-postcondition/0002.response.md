According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is positive infinity. For the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is 0.
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
