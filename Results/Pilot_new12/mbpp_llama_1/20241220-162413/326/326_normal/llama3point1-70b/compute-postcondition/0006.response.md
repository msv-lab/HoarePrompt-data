Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` is less than the initial value of `min_diff`, then `min_diff` equals the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` and `diff` equals the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `min_diff` retaining its initial value of positive infinity and `diff` retaining its initial value of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`.***
