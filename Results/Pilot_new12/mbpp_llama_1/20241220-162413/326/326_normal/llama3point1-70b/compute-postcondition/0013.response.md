The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The initial state provides that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. 
After the code is executed, `min_diff` equals `diff` which equals `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, and `min_diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, and `min_diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.**
