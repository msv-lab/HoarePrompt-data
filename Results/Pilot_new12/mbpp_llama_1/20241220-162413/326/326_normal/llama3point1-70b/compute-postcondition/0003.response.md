To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.

The code calculates the difference between the first two elements of the `arr` list:
```python
diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
```
Given `i` is 0, this translates to:
```python
diff = abs(arr[0] - arr[1])
```
Since `arr` is a sorted list, the difference between consecutive elements will be the smallest possible difference between any two elements in the list that are next to each other. However, without knowing the exact values of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, we can only say that `diff` will be the absolute difference between these two elements.

The states of `arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Only a new variable `diff` is introduced.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, i.e., `|arr[0] - arr[1]|`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is `|arr[0] - arr[1]|`**
