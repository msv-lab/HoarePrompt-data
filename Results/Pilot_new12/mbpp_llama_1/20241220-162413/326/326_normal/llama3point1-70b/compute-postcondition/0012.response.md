To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions. The initial state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2. The code snippet is `diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`.

Given that `i` is 2, `arr[i]` refers to the third element in the list `arr` (since list indices start at 0), and `arr[i + 1]` refers to the fourth element in the list `arr`. 

The expression `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])` calculates the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list, the absolute difference between consecutive elements is a non-negative integer.

The variable `diff` is assigned this absolute difference. The states of `arr`, `target`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**
