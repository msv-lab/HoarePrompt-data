arr is a list of integers, and target is either an irrelevant parameter or the minimum difference is found between all pairs of elements in arr. Alternatively, if target is relevant, arr is a list of integers and target is an integer such that we are looking for two elements in arr that sum to or are closest to target, but based on the function name and general interpretation of similar problems, it seems more likely the target is irrelevant and we are simply finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
