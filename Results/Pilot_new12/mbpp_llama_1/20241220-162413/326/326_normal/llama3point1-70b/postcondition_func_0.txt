The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, and returns the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity. The integer `target` does not affect the function's behavior. The function's output is the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list, which can be used to determine the closest pair of consecutive numbers in the list. The function handles edge cases where the input list `arr` has less than 2 elements, in which case it returns positive infinity.
