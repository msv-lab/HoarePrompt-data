Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program starts by sorting the input array `arr`. This is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two elements because the smallest difference will always be between two adjacent elements in the sorted array.

2. **Initialization of Minimum Difference**: The variable `min_diff` is initialized to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This ensures that any difference found between elements in the array will be less than the initial value of `min_diff`, allowing the program to correctly identify the minimum difference.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**: The program then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference `diff` between each pair of consecutive elements (`arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`).

4. **Updating Minimum Difference**: If the current difference `diff` is less than the current minimum difference `min_diff`, the program updates `min_diff` with the value of `diff`. This process continues until all pairs of consecutive elements have been examined.

5. **Returning Minimum Difference**: After iterating through the entire array, the program returns the minimum difference found. If the array has at least two elements, this will be the smallest difference between any two elements in the array. If the array has less than two elements, `min_diff` will remain at its initial value of positive infinity, which is a reasonable result since there are not enough elements to calculate a difference.

The problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided program correctly implements this by sorting the array and then finding the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements, which, due to the sorting, represents the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The program handles cases where the array has at least two elements correctly and returns positive infinity for arrays with less than two elements, aligning with the problem's implicit expectations for such edge cases.

However, it's worth noting that the problem description and the program seem to ignore the `target` parameter passed to `func_1(arr, target)`. Since the problem description does not specify any role for `target` in calculating the minimum difference, and the program does not use `target`, this does not affect the correctness of the program with respect to the given problem description. But in a real-world scenario, unused parameters can be a sign of a design issue or a potential bug if the parameter was intended to be used.
