Correctness: **False**.

The given Python program does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case. The issue with this program is that it takes an additional argument `target` that is not used in the function. According to the problem description, the function should only take an array as an argument to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

For example, if we try to call the function with only one argument, it will raise an error because it expects two arguments:

```python
arr = [5, 2, 8, 12, 3]
print(func_1(arr))  # This will raise an error
```

Another potential issue with the function is that it does not handle the case where the input array has less than two elements. In this case, the function will not return an error, but it will return `inf` (infinity), which might not be the expected result.

However, if we modify the function to only take one argument (the array) and add error handling to check if the array has at least two elements, it will work correctly in every case. 

Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or raise an error
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
