Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the provided code only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This means that the code does not consider the differences between non-consecutive elements, which could potentially be smaller.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 10, 2]`, the code will first sort the array to get `[1, 2, 10]`. Then, it will calculate the differences between consecutive elements: `abs(1-2) = 1` and `abs(2-10) = 8`. The minimum difference will be `1`, which is correct in this case.

However, if the input array is `[1, 3, 2]`, the code will first sort the array to get `[1, 2, 3]`. Then, it will calculate the differences between consecutive elements: `abs(1-2) = 1` and `abs(2-3) = 1`. The minimum difference will be `1`, which is correct in this case.

But, if the input array is `[1, 10, 1.1]`, the code will first sort the array to get `[1, 1.1, 10]`. Then, it will calculate the differences between consecutive elements: `abs(1-1.1) = 0.1` and `abs(1.1-10) = 8.9`. The minimum difference will be `0.1`, which is correct in this case.

However, a case where the program does not work as expected is when the array has only one element, for example, `[5]`. In this case, the function should return `inf` (or a similar value indicating that there are no pairs of elements to calculate the difference), but the code will throw an error because it tries to access `arr[i + 1]` when `i` is the last index in the array.

Another issue is that the problem description does not mention anything about the `target` parameter, which is not used in the code. This could indicate that the code is not fully aligned with the problem description.

The code only considers the differences between consecutive elements, and it does not consider the case where the array has only one element. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
