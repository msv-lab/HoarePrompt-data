Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the provided program is named `func_1` and it takes two parameters `arr` and `target`. The `target` parameter is not used anywhere in the function, suggesting that the function is not properly designed for the problem at hand.

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains less than two elements. In such cases, the function will not return the expected result because it does not handle this edge case. For example, if the input array is `[5]`, the function will not raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input array is invalid for the problem.

Additionally, the function name `func_1` and the parameter `target` suggest that the function might be part of a larger program or is intended to solve a different problem. The function name and parameter names should be more descriptive and aligned with the problem description.

A corrected version of the program should handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element, and should have a more descriptive name and parameter names. 

Here's a possible corrected version:

```python
def min_difference(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Array must contain at least two elements")
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This corrected version raises an error if the input array contains less than two elements and has a more descriptive name and parameter names.
