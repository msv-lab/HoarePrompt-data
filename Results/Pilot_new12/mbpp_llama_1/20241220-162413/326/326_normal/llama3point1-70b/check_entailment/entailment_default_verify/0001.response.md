Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** seems to be inaccurate. 

The original assessment mentions that the function does not follow the problem description because it takes two parameters, `arr` and `target`, but the `target` parameter is not used anywhere in the function. However, the output hints confirm that the integer `target` does not affect the function's behavior, and the function's output is the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list.

The original assessment also points out that the function does not handle the edge case where the input array contains less than two elements. However, the output hints indicate that the function returns positive infinity when the input list `arr` has less than 2 elements, which is a reasonable way to handle this edge case.

Moreover, although the function name `func_1` and the parameter `target` are not descriptive, the function's behavior aligns with the problem description according to the output hints.

Therefore, considering the output hints and the problem description, the program seems to be correct in terms of its functionality, despite some naming issues and the unused `target` parameter.

Final: **True**
