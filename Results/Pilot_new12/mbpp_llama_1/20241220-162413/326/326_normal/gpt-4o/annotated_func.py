#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr) and n >= 2.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr) and n >= 2

    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 2`, `i` is `n-2`, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr`, or remains `float('inf')` if the loop did not execute (which, given the initial conditions, is not possible since `n >= 2`).
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and its length `n` as input, and returns either 0 if the length of the list is less than 2, or the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr` if the length of the list is 2 or more. The function first checks the length of the list, and if it's less than 2, it immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function guarantees a return value equal to the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list. The function handles edge cases where the list has less than 2 elements by returning 0, ensuring that it always returns a valid value.
