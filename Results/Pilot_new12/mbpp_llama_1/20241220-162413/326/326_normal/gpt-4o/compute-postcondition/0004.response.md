The code initializes a variable `min_diff` and assigns it the value of positive infinity. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` == `len(arr)` and `n` >= 2, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`**
