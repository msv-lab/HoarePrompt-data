To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`.
- `i` is 1.
- `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`.
- `min_diff` is either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]` if `arr[2] - arr[1]` is smaller.

The code provided is:
```python
min_diff = diff
```

Given that `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, this means `min_diff` will be assigned the value of `diff`, which is `arr[2] - arr[1]`. 

Therefore, the output state after executing the code will be:
- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `diff` remains `arr[2] - arr[1]`.
- `min_diff` is now definitely `arr[2] - arr[1]`, as it has been explicitly assigned this value.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
