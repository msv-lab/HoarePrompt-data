According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be at least 3.

Additionally, since `i` is now 1, `diff` should be updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]` to reflect the difference between the current element and the next element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is either the previous value or the new `diff` if it's smaller**
