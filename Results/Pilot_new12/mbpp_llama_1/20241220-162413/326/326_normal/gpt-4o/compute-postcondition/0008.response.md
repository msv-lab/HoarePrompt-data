The code updates the value of `min_diff` to be equal to the current value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is less than the initial value of `min_diff`, which was `float('inf')`. 

Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and `n` is the length of `arr`, the initial value of `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`, so `min_diff` will be updated to this smaller difference.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `arr` is still a sorted list of integers, `n` is still a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`, `i` is still 0, and `diff` is still less than the new value of `min_diff`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 2`, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is less than the new value of `min_diff` which is `min_diff` = `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
