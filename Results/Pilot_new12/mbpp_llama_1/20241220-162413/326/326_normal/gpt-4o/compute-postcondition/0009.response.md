Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 2`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff` is less than the original value of `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`, otherwise `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`.***
