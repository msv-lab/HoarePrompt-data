Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 2`, initially `min_diff` was `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, initially `diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`, the current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`**
