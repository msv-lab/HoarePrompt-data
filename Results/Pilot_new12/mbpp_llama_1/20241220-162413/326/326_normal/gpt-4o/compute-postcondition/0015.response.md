To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3` and `n > 2`. This implies that `arr` has at least 3 elements.
   - `i` is 2, which means we are considering the index starting from 0, so `i` points to the third element in `arr`.
   - `min_diff` is either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[2] - arr[1]` implies the difference between the third and second elements in `arr`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
   - Given `i` is 2, this means `diff = arr[3] - arr[2]`. So, `diff` is the difference between the fourth and third elements in `arr`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not modified by the code. Therefore, `arr` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` remains the length of `arr` which is at least 3, and `i` remains 2.
   - `min_diff`'s value is not directly affected by this line of code, so its value remains either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]`.
   - A new variable `diff` is introduced and assigned the value of the difference between the fourth and third elements in `arr`, which is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

**Output State**: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
