The value of `diff` is updated to be the difference between the elements at index `i + 1` and `i` in the array `arr`. Since `i` is 1, this means `diff` becomes `arr[2] - arr[1]`. However, given that `diff` was already defined as `arr[2] - arr[1]`, the value of `diff` doesn't change based on the initial conditions provided. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` remains either its previous value or `diff` if `diff` is smaller.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]` if `arr[2] - arr[1]` is smaller**
