Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, and if `diff` is less than the previous value of `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, otherwise `min_diff` retains its previous value or remains `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
