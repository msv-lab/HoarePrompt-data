According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since the loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, it requires `n` to be greater than 1 to execute at least once. Given that `n` is already stated to be a positive integer such that `n` == `len(arr)` and `n` >= 2, this condition is inherently met. For the loop to start executing, the index `i` should be initialized to 0, as that's the starting point of the range.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` == `len(arr)` and `n` >= 2, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0**
