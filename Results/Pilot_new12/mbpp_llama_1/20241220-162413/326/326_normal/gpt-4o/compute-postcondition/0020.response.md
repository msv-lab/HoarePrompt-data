The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer where `n` equals the length of `arr` and is greater than or equal to 2. After executing the function body, there are two possible return values: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and its length `n`, and return either 0 or the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`.
