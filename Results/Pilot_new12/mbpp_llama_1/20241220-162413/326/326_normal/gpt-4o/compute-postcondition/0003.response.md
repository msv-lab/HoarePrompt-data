The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is the length of the list `arr`, which does not change when the list is sorted. The sorted list `arr` is assigned back to the variable `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` == `len(arr)` and `n` >= 2**
