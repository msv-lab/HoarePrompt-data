Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1. If `diff` (which is `arr[2] - arr[1]`) is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, meaning `min_diff` will be `arr[2] - arr[1]`. Otherwise, `min_diff` retains its original value, which could be either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]` if `arr[2] - arr[1]` was smaller than the previous `min_diff`.***
