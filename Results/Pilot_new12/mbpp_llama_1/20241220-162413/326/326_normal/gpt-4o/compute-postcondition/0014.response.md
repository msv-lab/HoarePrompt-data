According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)` and `n >= 3` and `n > 2`, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is either its previous value or `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
