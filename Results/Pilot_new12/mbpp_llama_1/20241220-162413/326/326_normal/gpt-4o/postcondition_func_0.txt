The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and its length `n` as input, and returns either 0 if the length of the list is less than 2, or the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr` if the length of the list is 2 or more. The function first checks the length of the list, and if it's less than 2, it immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function guarantees a return value equal to the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list. The function handles edge cases where the list has less than 2 elements by returning 0, ensuring that it always returns a valid value.
