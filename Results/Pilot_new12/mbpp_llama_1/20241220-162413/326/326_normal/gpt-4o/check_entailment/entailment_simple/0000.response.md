Correctness: **True**

This program is correct because it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it's correct:

1. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If this condition is met, it returns 0. However, based on the problem description, it's stated that `n` will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, so this condition will never be met in a valid input scenario.

2. The function then sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order.

3. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum difference found between any two adjacent elements.

4. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.

5. If the calculated difference is less than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` with the new value.

6. After iterating over the entire array, `min_diff` will hold the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, because the array is sorted.

7. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description and will return the correct result for any valid input.
