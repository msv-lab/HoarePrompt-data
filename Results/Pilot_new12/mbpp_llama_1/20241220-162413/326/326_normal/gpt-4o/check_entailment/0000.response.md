Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0 because there are not enough elements to calculate a difference. Then, it sorts the array in ascending order and initializes `min_diff` with positive infinity. 

The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements and updating `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found. Finally, it returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases. The sorting step ensures that the function considers all possible pairs of elements, and the iteration through the sorted array guarantees that it finds the minimum difference. The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input array has only one or two elements.

For example, if the input array is `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)`, the function will first sort it to `(1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25)`, and then it will calculate the differences between adjacent elements: `2`, `2`, `13`, `1`, and `6`. The minimum difference is `1`, which is the correct result.

Another example is the input array `(4, 3, 2, 6)`, which will be sorted to `(2, 3, 4, 6)`. The differences between adjacent elements are `1`, `1`, and `2`, and the minimum difference is `1`, as expected.

Overall, the function is correct and should work as expected for all possible input arrays.
