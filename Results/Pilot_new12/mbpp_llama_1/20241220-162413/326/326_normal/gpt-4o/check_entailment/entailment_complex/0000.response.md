Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input. It first checks if the length of the array is less than 2. If it is, the function returns 0. This is a valid edge case handling, as the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, but the given assertions suggest that 0 is the expected output.
2. If the length of the array is 2 or more, the function sorts the array in ascending order. This is a necessary step to find the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements.
3. The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found so far, initialized to infinity.
4. After iterating through the entire array, the function returns the minimum difference found. This is the correct output, as it represents the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The assertions provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function. They show that the function returns the expected output for different input cases.

In summary, the program is correct because it correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, handles edge cases, and matches the expected output specified in the assertions.
