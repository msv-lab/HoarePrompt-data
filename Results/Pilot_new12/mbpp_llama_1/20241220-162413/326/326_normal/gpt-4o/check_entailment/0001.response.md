Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes an array and its size as input, sorts the array, and then iterates over the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Handling edge cases**: The program checks if the array size is less than 2 and returns 0 in such cases. This is correct because the problem description doesn't specify what to do in such cases, but returning 0 is a reasonable assumption.

2. **Sorting the array**: The program sorts the array, which is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

3. **Finding the minimum difference**: The program iterates over the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found so far, which is initialized to infinity.

4. **Returning the minimum difference**: The program returns the minimum difference found, which is the correct result according to the problem description.

The program works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it's hard to think of a case where it wouldn't work as expected. For example, if the input array is `[5, 5, 5]`, the program will correctly return `0`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
