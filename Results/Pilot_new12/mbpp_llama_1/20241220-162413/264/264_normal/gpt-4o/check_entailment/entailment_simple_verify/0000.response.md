The original assessment correctly concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(degrees)` accurately converts degrees to radians. This assessment is based on the standard conversion formula `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`, which is correctly implemented in the function. 

The function directly applies this conversion formula by multiplying the input `degrees` by `math.pi / 180`, ensuring that any angle given in degrees is correctly converted to its equivalent in radians. The unit tests provided demonstrate the function's correctness for various positive degree inputs, and the formula itself works for all real numbers, including negative numbers and zero.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by clarifying the states at different points in the program. It confirms that the input `degrees` can be a number (either an integer or a float) before the function call and that the program returns the radian equivalent of this input. 

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and will not cause errors, the function is indeed correct as it correctly implements the conversion formula for all potential valid cases.

Final: **True**
