You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(degrees)` is designed to convert degrees to radians. It uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula between these two units of measurement. 

The function `func_1(degrees)` is implemented correctly, as it directly applies this conversion formula by multiplying the input `degrees` by `math.pi / 180`, where `math.pi` is a constant representing π. This ensures that the function will correctly convert any angle given in degrees to its equivalent in radians.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`, `assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976`, and `assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953`, demonstrate the function's correctness for positive degree inputs. 

Since the formula works for all real numbers (including negative numbers and zero), and the function does not contain any conditional statements that might alter its behavior based on the sign of the input, it will correctly convert negative degree inputs and zero degrees to radians as well. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the function `func_1(degrees)` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians for all potential cases, and no example could be found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns its radian equivalent, calculated by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of math.pi to 180. The function handles both integer and float inputs, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs. The program's state after execution is that it has returned the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, without modifying the original input value. The function does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values that may exceed the limits of floating point precision, or non-numeric inputs that would raise a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
