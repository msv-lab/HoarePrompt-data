Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. 

Here's why it's correct:
- The function takes an input `degrees` which can be an integer or a float, representing the angle in degrees.
- The function returns the result of multiplying the input `degrees` by `(math.pi / 180)`, which is the conversion factor from degrees to radians. This is a standard mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians.
- The unit tests (assert statements) provided also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(90)` correctly returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is the radian equivalent of 90 degrees.

Since the function correctly implements the conversion formula and passes the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
