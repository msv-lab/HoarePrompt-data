Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians. The conversion is performed by multiplying the input degrees by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180, which is the standard formula for converting degrees to radians. 

The function handles both integer and float inputs correctly, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests (`assert` statements). These tests cover various degree values and verify that the function returns the expected radian values.

The output hints also agree with the code and provide additional insights into the function's behavior, such as its ability to handle non-numeric inputs and potential edge cases. However, as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the lack of error checking for non-numeric inputs does not affect the correctness of the function for valid inputs.

Given the provided code and output hints, the function appears to correctly implement the conversion of degrees to radians for all valid input cases.
