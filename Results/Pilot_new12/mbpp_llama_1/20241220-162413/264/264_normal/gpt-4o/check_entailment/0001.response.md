Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians. It uses the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians. The program includes assert statements that verify the function's correctness for specific inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees).

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It does not contain any conditional statements or edge cases that could cause it to behave incorrectly for certain inputs. The `math.pi / 180` factor is a constant, and multiplying it by the input degrees will always produce the correct result.

In Python, the multiplication operation will work correctly for both positive and negative numbers, as well as for fractional values. Therefore, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including:

* Positive integers (e.g., 90, 60)
* Negative integers (e.g., -90, -60)
* Fractional values (e.g., 45.5, -30.25)
* Zero (0)

Since the function uses a simple and well-established formula for converting degrees to radians, and there are no apparent edge cases or special conditions that could cause it to fail, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
