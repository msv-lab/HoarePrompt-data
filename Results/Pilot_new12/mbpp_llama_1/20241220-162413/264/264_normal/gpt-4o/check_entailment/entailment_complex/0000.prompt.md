You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a number, which can be an integer or a float.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the radian equivalent of the input 'degrees', where 'degrees' is a number that can be an integer or a float.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns its radian equivalent, calculated by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of math.pi to 180. The function handles both integer and float inputs, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs. The program's state after execution is that it has returned the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, without modifying the original input value. The function does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values that may exceed the limits of floating point precision, or non-numeric inputs that would raise a TypeError.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
