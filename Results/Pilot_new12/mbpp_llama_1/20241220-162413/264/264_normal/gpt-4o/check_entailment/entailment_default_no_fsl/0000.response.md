Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians. The conversion is performed by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180. 

The program description states that the task is to write a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code does exactly that. The function handles both integer and float inputs, as demonstrated by the provided assertions.

The output hints suggest that the function may not handle non-numeric inputs or extremely large/small input values. However, according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the code is correct within the scope of the problem description.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for specific input values (90, 60, and 120 degrees), and the conversion formula used in the function is mathematically correct. 

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and within the floating-point precision limits, the function will return the correct radian equivalent for any degree value. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
