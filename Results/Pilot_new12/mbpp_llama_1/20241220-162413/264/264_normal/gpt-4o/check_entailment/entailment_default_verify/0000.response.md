Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness still holds true. The function `func_1(degrees)` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the standard mathematical formula. The unit tests provided support the correctness of the function for various input values.

The output hints further clarify the functionality of the code, stating that it handles both integer and float inputs and does not perform error checking for non-numeric inputs. While it is true that the function does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values that may exceed the limits of floating point precision, or non-numeric inputs that would raise a TypeError, these are assumptions that are reasonable given the problem context. The problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, and in this context, the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, considering all the information provided, I find the original assessment to be accurate. The program correctly solves the problem as described, within the bounds of the assumptions made about the input.

Final: **True**
