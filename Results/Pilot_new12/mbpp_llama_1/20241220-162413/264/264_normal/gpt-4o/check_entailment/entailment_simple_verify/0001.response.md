The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and based on the provided code and annotations, this assessment appears to be accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses the standard conversion formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This formula is mathematically correct and is widely used for converting degrees to radians.

The annotations in the code confirm that the function takes a number (integer or float) as input, which is what the problem description expects. The function then returns the radian equivalent of the input, which is the desired output.

The original assessment also correctly notes that the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including positive and negative integers, fractional values, and zero. The annotations do not provide any information that contradicts this assessment.

Furthermore, the provided assert statements verify the correctness of the function for specific inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which provides additional evidence that the function is working as expected.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
