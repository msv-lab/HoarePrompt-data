Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent by multiplying the input by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180. This is a standard mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians.

The program handles both integer and float inputs, as specified in the problem description. Although it does not perform error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, the problem description does not require this, and we assume that the input will be valid.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`, demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. The function's implementation is straightforward and does not contain any errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is verified.
