Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(degrees)` is designed to convert degrees to radians. It uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula between these two units of measurement. 

The function `func_1(degrees)` is implemented correctly, as it directly applies this conversion formula by multiplying the input `degrees` by `math.pi / 180`, where `math.pi` is a constant representing π. This ensures that the function will correctly convert any angle given in degrees to its equivalent in radians.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`, `assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976`, and `assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953`, demonstrate the function's correctness for positive degree inputs. 

Since the formula works for all real numbers (including negative numbers and zero), and the function does not contain any conditional statements that might alter its behavior based on the sign of the input, it will correctly convert negative degree inputs and zero degrees to radians as well. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the function `func_1(degrees)` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians for all potential cases, and no example could be found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
