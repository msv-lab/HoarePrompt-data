You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians. It uses the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`, which is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians. The program includes assert statements that verify the function's correctness for specific inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees).

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It does not contain any conditional statements or edge cases that could cause it to behave incorrectly for certain inputs. The `math.pi / 180` factor is a constant, and multiplying it by the input degrees will always produce the correct result.

In Python, the multiplication operation will work correctly for both positive and negative numbers, as well as for fractional values. Therefore, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including:

* Positive integers (e.g., 90, 60)
* Negative integers (e.g., -90, -60)
* Fractional values (e.g., 45.5, -30.25)
* Zero (0)

Since the function uses a simple and well-established formula for converting degrees to radians, and there are no apparent edge cases or special conditions that could cause it to fail, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns its radian equivalent, calculated by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of math.pi to 180. The function handles both integer and float inputs, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs. The program's state after execution is that it has returned the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, without modifying the original input value. The function does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values that may exceed the limits of floating point precision, or non-numeric inputs that would raise a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
