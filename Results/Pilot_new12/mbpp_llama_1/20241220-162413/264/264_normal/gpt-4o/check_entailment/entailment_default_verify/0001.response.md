The original assessment states that the program is correct because it uses a standard conversion formula from degrees to radians and handles potential cases correctly. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`. The code includes assert statements to verify the function's correctness for specific inputs.

The output hints provided suggest that the function handles both integer and float inputs and returns the radian equivalent without modifying the original input value. However, they also mention that the function does not perform error checking for non-numeric inputs and does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values.

Despite the lack of error checking and handling for edge cases, the problem description and the provided code do not explicitly require these features. The problem description only asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the code fulfills this requirement using a standard conversion formula.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking does not affect the program's correctness in this context. The program's ability to handle both integer and float inputs and return the correct radian equivalent aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the output hints, and the problem description, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
