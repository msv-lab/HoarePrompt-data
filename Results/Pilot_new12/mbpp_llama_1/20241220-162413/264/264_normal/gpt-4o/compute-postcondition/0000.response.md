To calculate the output state, we consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state is that `degrees` is a number, which can be an integer or a float. The code snippet is `return degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. 

Given that `degrees` can be any number (integer or float) and `math.pi` is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, the expression `math.pi / 180` is a constant value. When `degrees` is multiplied by this constant, the result is the conversion of degrees to radians, since the formula to convert degrees to radians is indeed `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`.

Therefore, the program returns the result of this conversion, which is the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`.

Output State: **The program returns the radian equivalent of the input 'degrees', where 'degrees' is a number that can be an integer or a float.**
