Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns its radian equivalent, calculated by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of math.pi to 180. The function handles both integer and float inputs, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs. The program's state after execution is that it has returned the radian equivalent of the input `degrees`, without modifying the original input value. The function does not account for potential edge cases such as extremely large or small input values that may exceed the limits of floating point precision, or non-numeric inputs that would raise a TypeError.**
