Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Conversion Formula**: The program uses the correct conversion formula to convert degrees to radians, which is `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`. This formula is mathematically accurate and directly implements the conversion as required by the problem description.

2. **Input Type**: The problem description states that the input `deg` can be either an integer or a float, representing an angle in degrees. The program does not explicitly check the type of `deg`, but since Python is dynamically typed and the `math.pi / 180` factor applies to both integers and floats without modification, the function will work correctly for both types of input.

3. **Input Range**: The problem description mentions that the function should be able to handle all potential cases, including positive, negative, and zero degree inputs. The formula `deg * math.pi / 180` works for all these cases:
   - For positive degree inputs, it correctly converts them to positive radians.
   - For negative degree inputs, it correctly converts them to negative radians, as the negative sign is propagated through the multiplication.
   - For zero degree inputs, it correctly returns zero radians, since `0 * math.pi / 180 = 0`.

4. **Non-Integer Degree Inputs**: The function also correctly handles non-integer degree values. Since the input is multiplied by a floating-point number (`math.pi / 180`), the result will be a float, which allows for precise representation of non-integer degree conversions.

5. **No Modification of Input**: The function does not modify the input parameter `deg` but returns a new value, which aligns with the problem description's implication that the input should not be modified.

Overall, the program correctly implements the degree to radian conversion for all specified input cases and conditions without modifying the input or requiring additional error checking (given the assumption of valid inputs).
