The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula to convert degrees to radians, which is a standard and well-established method. The annotations provided also support this assessment, as they describe the state of the program and the function's behavior accurately.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a single parameter `deg`, which can be either an integer or a float, and returns the converted value without modifying the input parameter or performing any error checking. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles all possible cases correctly, including positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as non-integer degree values. The annotated version of the code also mentions that the function covers all potential cases without modifying the input parameter or performing any error checking.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct. The original assessment is accurate because it correctly evaluates the program's behavior and handling of different input cases.

Final: **True**
