Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly defines a function `func_1` that converts an input angle in degrees to its equivalent angle in radians. It uses the standard conversion formula `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`, which is universally applicable for all degrees to radians conversions, including positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as non-integer degree values.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and without any specified restrictions on the range of degrees that the function should handle, the function appears to be correctly implemented for all intended use cases. The function does not modify the input parameter `deg` and does not perform any error checking on the type or range of the input angle, which is in line with the assumptions provided.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that it correctly handles all potential cases, including the conversion of positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as non-integer degree values, without any issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the assumptions about the input, the code seems to work as expected and correctly converts degrees to radians for every potential case.
