Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment states that the program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * π / 180`. This assessment makes sense based on the provided code, as the function `func_1(deg)` accurately implements this formula.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, stating that the input `deg` is a number representing an angle in degrees and that the program returns the angle in radians. This annotation supports the original assessment, as it confirms that the function is designed to perform the correct conversion.

Furthermore, the annotated version of the code does not introduce any new information that would contradict the original assessment. The program still uses the `math.pi` constant to represent π, ensuring a precise conversion, and it does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially introduce errors or edge cases.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct. The original assessment accurately reflected the program's behavior, and the annotated version provides additional confirmation of its correctness.

Final: **True**
