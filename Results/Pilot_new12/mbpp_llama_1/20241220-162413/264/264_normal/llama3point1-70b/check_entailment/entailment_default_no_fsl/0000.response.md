Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(deg)` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent angle in radians. The function correctly implements the conversion formula `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`, which covers all potential cases, including positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as non-integer degree values.

The program does not perform any error checking on the type or range of the input angle, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the program for the assumed valid inputs.

The output hints also suggest that the function correctly converts input angles to radians for various cases, and there are no indications of any potential cases where the program might fail to produce the correct output.

Given that the program correctly implements the conversion formula and assumes valid inputs, it should work as expected for all potential cases, and therefore, the correctness is **True**.
