Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` correctly converts degrees to radians. The formula for converting degrees to radians is `radians = degrees * π / 180`, which is accurately implemented in the function. 

The function uses the `math.pi` constant to represent π, ensuring a precise conversion. It does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially introduce errors or edge cases. 

This function will work correctly for all possible inputs, including positive and negative degrees, as well as zero. For example, `func_1(90)` will correctly return `π/2`, and `func_1(-45)` will return `-π/4`. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
