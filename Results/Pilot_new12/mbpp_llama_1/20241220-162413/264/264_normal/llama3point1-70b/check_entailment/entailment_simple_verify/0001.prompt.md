You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The conversion is performed using the formula `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`, which is a standard and well-established method for converting degrees to radians.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Positive degrees: The function correctly converts positive angles in degrees to radians. For example, `func_1(90)` returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is the correct radian value for 90 degrees.
* Negative degrees: The function also correctly handles negative angles in degrees. For example, `func_1(-90)` returns `-1.5707963267948966`, which is the correct radian value for -90 degrees.
* Zero degrees: The function returns `0.0` for an input of `0`, which is the correct radian value for 0 degrees.
* Non-integer degrees: The function can handle non-integer degree values, such as `func_1(45.5)`, which returns `0.7947617672575708`, the correct radian value for 45.5 degrees.
* Large degree values: The function can handle large degree values, such as `func_1(360*1000)`, which returns `6283.185307179586`, the correct radian value for 360,000 degrees.

There are no edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. The function is well-defined and works as expected for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a number (either an integer or a float) representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the angle in radians, which is the result of converting 'deg' from degrees to radians using the conversion factor math.pi / 180, where 'deg' is the input angle in degrees.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
