The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and based on the annotated version of the code, this assessment remains accurate.

The problem description requires a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` correctly implements this conversion using the formula `radians = degrees * Ï€ / 180`. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes an input angle in degrees, converts it to radians using the specified formula, and returns the result.

The annotations also highlight that the function can handle various types of input, including positive and negative degrees, as well as non-integer degree values. This aligns with the original assessment, which stated that the function will work correctly for all possible inputs.

Furthermore, the assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program is reasonable, as it allows the focus to be on the correctness of the conversion algorithm rather than error handling. Since the function does not modify the input parameter or perform any unnecessary operations, it can be considered correct for its intended purpose.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program's correctness remains **True**.

Final: **True**
