To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it accurately converts degrees to radians as specified in the problem description.

The formula to convert degrees to radians is: `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`, where `π` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` implements this conversion as follows:
```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```
Here's a breakdown of why this program is correct:

1. **Correct Formula**: The function uses the correct formula for converting degrees to radians, which is `degrees * (π / 180)`. The use of `math.pi` for `π` ensures accuracy in the conversion.
2. **Input Handling**: Although the problem statement assumes valid input, the function inherently handles both integer and floating-point degree values because Python's numeric types support both, and the `math.pi` constant and `/` operator work correctly with both types.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated value in radians, which directly addresses the problem description's requirement to convert degrees to radians.

Since the function correctly implements the degree-to-radian conversion formula and handles the input types as described (assuming valid input as per the problem statement), and returns the result of the conversion, it meets all the criteria outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
