The initial state has 'deg' as a number, which can be an integer or a float, representing an angle in degrees. The code returns the result of the expression `deg * math.pi / 180`. This expression is a conversion formula from degrees to radians. 

Given that 'deg' is an angle in degrees and 'math.pi' is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi, approximately equal to 3.14159, the expression `deg * math.pi / 180` converts the angle from degrees to radians.

Output State: **The program returns the angle in radians, which is the result of converting 'deg' from degrees to radians using the conversion factor math.pi / 180, where 'deg' is the input angle in degrees.**
