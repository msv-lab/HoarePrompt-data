The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a number, which can be either an integer or a float, representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, the function returns the angle in radians, which is the result of converting `deg` from degrees to radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg, which is an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians.**
