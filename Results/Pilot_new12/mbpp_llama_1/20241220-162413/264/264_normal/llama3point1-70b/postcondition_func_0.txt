The function converts an input angle in degrees to its equivalent angle in radians, accepting a single parameter `deg` which can be either an integer or a float, and returns the converted value, covering all potential cases including positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as non-integer degree values, without modifying the input parameter or performing any error checking on the type or range of the input angle.
