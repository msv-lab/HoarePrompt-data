Correctness: **True**

The provided code calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function `func_1` uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the binomial coefficients and sums them up for even indices.

The code correctly handles the calculation of binomial coefficients for all even indices from 0 to `n`. The loop iterates over the range `n + 1`, and the `if` condition checks if the index `i` is even. If `i` is even, the binomial coefficient is added to the sum.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the expected behavior. The hints state that the function computes 1 if `n` is 0, or 2^(n-1) if `n` is greater than 0, which is consistent with the binomial coefficient formula.

Since the code correctly implements the calculation of the sum of even index binomial coefficients and handles all cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness is **True**. 

The code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a positive integer, as it is assumed that the input will be valid. Additionally, the code does not have any side effects and completes its execution without modifying the input `n`. 

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
