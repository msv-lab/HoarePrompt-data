Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The function `func_1(n)` does exactly this.

Here's why:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which is specified to be a positive integer according to the problem description.
2. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
4. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum` variable.
5. After the loop finishes, the function returns the `sum` variable, which contains the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices.

The program's behavior is consistent with the problem description for all positive integer inputs `n`. For example, when `n` is 0, the function returns 1, which is the sum of the binomial coefficient for the even index 0 (which is 1). When `n` is greater than 0, the function returns the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices, which is equal to 2^(n-1).

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
