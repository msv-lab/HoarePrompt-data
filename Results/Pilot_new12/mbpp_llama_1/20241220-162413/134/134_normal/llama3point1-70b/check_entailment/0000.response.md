Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
3. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
4. The `math.comb` function calculates the binomial coefficient `n` choose `i`, which is the coefficient of the `i`-th term in the binomial expansion of `(1 + x)^n`.
5. The program returns the sum of all even index binomial coefficients.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When `n` is 0, the sum is 1, because the only even index binomial coefficient is `math.comb(0, 0)`, which is 1.
* When `n` is 1, the sum is 2, because the even index binomial coefficients are `math.comb(1, 0)` and `math.comb(1, 1)` is not included because 1 is an odd index, so the sum is 1.
* When `n` is greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any logical errors, the correctness of the program is **True**.
