Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
- For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the running sum.
- The `math.comb(n, i)` function returns the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order, which is exactly what is needed for calculating binomial coefficients.
- Finally, the function returns the sum of all even index binomial coefficients.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Small values of `n`, such as `n = 1` or `n = 2`.
- Large values of `n`, as the `math.comb` function can handle large inputs.
- Edge cases, such as `n = 0`, which returns `1` (since there is only one way to choose 0 items from 0 items, and its index is even).

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
