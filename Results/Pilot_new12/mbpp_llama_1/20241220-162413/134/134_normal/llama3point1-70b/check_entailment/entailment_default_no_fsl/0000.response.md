Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct as it accurately calculates the sum of binomial coefficients with even indices. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the binomial coefficient `n choose i`.
2. The loop iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, the program checks if the current `i` is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
4. If `i` is even, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the `sum`.
5. The program returns the calculated `sum`, which represents the sum of binomial coefficients with even indices.

The provided output hints also agree with the program's behavior. For `n = 0`, the function returns 1, which is the expected result since the sum of binomial coefficients with even indices is just `n choose 0`, which is 1. For `n > 0`, the function correctly calculates the sum, which indeed equals 2^(n-1) due to the binomial theorem.

Since the program handles all non-negative integers `n` and correctly calculates the sum of binomial coefficients with even indices, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
