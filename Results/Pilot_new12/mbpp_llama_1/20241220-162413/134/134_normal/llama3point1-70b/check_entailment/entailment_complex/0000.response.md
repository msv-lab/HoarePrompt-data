Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description because it does not accurately handle the case when `n` is 0. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`. However, the program function `func_1` allows `n` to be 0, and in this case, it returns 1. The problem statement specifically asks for a function that takes a positive integer `n`, implying `n` should be greater than 0.

Moreover, for `n` values greater than 0, the claim that the function returns 2^(n-1) is not always correct for the sum of even binomial coefficients of `n`. This sum does not necessarily equal 2^(n-1) as the provided comments in the code suggest. The function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients by iterating over all possible combinations and summing those where the index `i` is even, but the explanation and return value comments are misleading or incorrect for the general case.

The correct approach to verify the sum of even index binomial coefficients should directly relate to the properties of binomial distributions and not necessarily equate to 2^(n-1) for all positive integers `n` greater than 0. This simplification might hold for specific values of `n` or under certain conditions but does not universally apply.

Therefore, the program is not correct in the context of strictly following the given problem description for all potential cases, primarily due to the inclusion of `n = 0` and the incorrect generalization of the sum of even index binomial coefficients as 2^(n-1) for `n > 0`.
