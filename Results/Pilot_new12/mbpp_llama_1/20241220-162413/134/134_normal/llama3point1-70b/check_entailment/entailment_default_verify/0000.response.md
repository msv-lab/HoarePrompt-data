The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. This assessment is accurate because the provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n.

Upon analyzing the problem description, the program, and the original assessment, it's clear that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checks if `i` is even, and adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum if `i` is even.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the program. They clarify that the function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer, and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for all even `i` values from 0 to `n`. The output hints also specify that the function returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 2^(n-1) if `n` is greater than 0, which is consistent with the program's behavior.

The program handles `n` as a non-negative integer and provides the sum as a result without modifying the input `n` or having any side effects. The output hints confirm that the state of the program after execution is determined solely by the return value, which represents the calculated sum.

Based on the problem description, the program, the output hints, and the original assessment, there is no evidence to suggest that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of **True** remains accurate.

Final: **True**
