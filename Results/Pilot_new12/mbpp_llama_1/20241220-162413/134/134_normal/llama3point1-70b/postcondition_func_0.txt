The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It calculates and returns the sum of binomial coefficients for all even `i` values from 0 to `n`, effectively computing 1 if `n` is 0, or 2^(n-1) if `n` is greater than 0. The function handles `n` as a non-negative integer and provides the sum as a result. The state of the program after execution is determined solely by the return value, which represents this calculated sum. The function completes its execution without modifying the input `n` or having any side effects, leaving the state of the program with the computed sum available for further use.
