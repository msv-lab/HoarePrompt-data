The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 1 if a condition is met or the sum of binomial coefficients for all even `i` values from 0 to `n`, which can be calculated as 2^(n-1) for `n` greater than 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 1 when n equals 0 or 2^(n-1) when n is greater than 0, representing the sum of binomial coefficients for all even i values from 0 to n.**
