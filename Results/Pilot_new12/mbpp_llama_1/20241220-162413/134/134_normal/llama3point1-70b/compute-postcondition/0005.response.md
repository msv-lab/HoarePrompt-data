According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The loop can execute again if `n + 1` is greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already a positive integer, this condition is already met. Additionally, since `i` is now 1 (an odd number), there is no change in the `sum` variable as per the given conditions.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is 1**
