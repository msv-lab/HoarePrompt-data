To calculate the new value of `sum`, we need to consider the initial values of `n`, `i`, and `sum`. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and `sum` is 1. We are adding `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`. 

`math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. This is equivalent to calculating the binomial coefficient "n choose i", which is `n! / (i! * (n-i)!)`.

Given that `i` is 1, `math.comb(n, i)` simplifies to `n! / (1! * (n-1)!)`, which further simplifies to `n` because `n! / (n-1)! = n` and `1! = 1`.

Therefore, `sum` becomes `1 + n`.

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is `1 + n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `sum` is `1 + n`**
