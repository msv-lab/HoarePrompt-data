To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(n + 1):`, which means the loop's execution depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` will also be a positive integer, ensuring the loop can execute at least once.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, the minimum value of `n` is 1, making `n + 1` at least 2. This means `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n`, inclusive, because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` should initially be 0 (the first value in the range), and `n` should be at least 1 to ensure the loop body executes.

Considering the initial state where `n` is a positive integer and `sum` is 0, and adjusting for the loop to start executing, we need to ensure `n` is indeed a positive integer (which it is by initial condition), and `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
