According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is 1**
