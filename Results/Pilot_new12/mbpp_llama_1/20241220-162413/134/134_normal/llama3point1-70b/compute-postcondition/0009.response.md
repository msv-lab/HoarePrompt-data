To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is 1.

Given the code:
```python
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

This code calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time using the `math.comb` function and adds this value to `sum`.

Since `i` is 2, the function `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without regard to order, which is equivalent to `n * (n-1) / 2`.

Therefore, `sum` becomes `1 + n * (n-1) / 2`.

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state, considering the changes to `sum` and keeping the information about `n` and `i` as it was before the operation, is:
 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is `1 + n * (n-1) / 2`**
