To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` increments the value of `sum` by the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is 0.
- `i` is an even number, currently 0.

The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `i` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order. When `i` is 0, `math.comb(n, i)` equals 1, because there is exactly one way to choose zero elements from any set (which is to choose no elements).

So, `sum += math.comb(n, 0)` becomes `sum += 1`, because `math.comb(n, 0)` is always 1 regardless of the value of `n`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `sum` becomes 1 (since it was 0 and `math.comb(n, 0)` equals 1).
- `i` remains an even number, currently 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0**
