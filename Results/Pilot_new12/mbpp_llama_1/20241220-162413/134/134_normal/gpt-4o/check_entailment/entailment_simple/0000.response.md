To determine the correctness of the given Python function `func_1`, let's first understand what the problem description asks for and then analyze the provided function.

**Problem Description:**
The function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

**Understanding Binomial Coefficients:**
The binomial coefficients can be found using Pascal's triangle or the formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the row number (starting from 0) and \( k \) is the position in the row (also starting from 0). The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) involves summing the coefficients at even positions in the \( n \)th row of Pascal's triangle.

**Analyzing the Provided Function `func_1`:**
The function `func_1(n)` returns \( 2^{n-1} \). This is based on the mathematical property that the sum of the binomial coefficients in the expansion of \( (1+1)^n \) is \( 2^n \), and due to symmetry, the sum of the coefficients at even indices equals the sum of the coefficients at odd indices. Thus, each sum is exactly half of \( 2^n \), which is \( 2^{n-1} \).

**Correctness Analysis:**
The function `func_1` indeed calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients correctly for any given positive integer `n`, based on the mathematical property mentioned above. It leverages the fact that the sum of all binomial coefficients for a given `n` is \( 2^n \), and by symmetry, the sum of coefficients at even indices is \( 2^{n-1} \).

**Conclusion:**
Given the problem description and the mathematical property that justifies the function's implementation, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer `n`.

Correctness: **True**
