Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

The mathematical insight behind this problem is that the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a row in Pascal's triangle is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This can be proven using the binomial theorem and properties of binomial coefficients.

The function `func_1(n)` directly returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is the formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

Since the function directly implements the mathematical formula, it works correctly for all positive integer inputs. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work as expected, and it correctly implements the mathematical formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
