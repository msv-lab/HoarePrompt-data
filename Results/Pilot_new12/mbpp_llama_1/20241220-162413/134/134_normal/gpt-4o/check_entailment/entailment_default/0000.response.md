Correctness: **True**

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates `2` raised to the power of `n-1`, which is equivalent to the sum of even index binomial coefficients. This can be proven using the Binomial Theorem and the properties of binomial coefficients.

The Binomial Theorem states that `(x + y)^n = ∑(n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k`, where `n choose k` is the binomial coefficient. By setting `x = 1` and `y = 1`, we get `2^n = ∑(n choose k)`. By setting `x = 1` and `y = -1`, we get `0 = ∑(-1)^k * (n choose k)`. Adding these two equations, we get `2^n = ∑(n choose k) + ∑(-1)^k * (n choose k) = 2 * ∑(n choose k)`, where the sum is taken over even `k`.

Therefore, the sum of even index binomial coefficients is equal to `2^(n-1)`, which is exactly what the provided code calculates.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function returns the correct result for positive integer inputs. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function.

Since the code correctly implements the formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients and the output hints and unit tests confirm its correctness, the code is correct for all potential cases.
