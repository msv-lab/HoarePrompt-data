The original assessment claims that the program is correct, and it provides a mathematical explanation for why the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The annotated version of the code also supports this explanation, as it confirms that the function returns `2` raised to the power of `n-1`, which is consistent with the mathematical property described in the original assessment.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Given the mathematical explanation, the annotated version of the code, and the provided unit tests, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients is equal to `2^(n-1)`, and it returns the expected results for the provided unit tests.

Therefore, based on the available information, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
