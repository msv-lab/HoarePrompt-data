The problem description requires a function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. The provided Python function `func_1(n)` uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of `n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. 

The original assessment claims that the function is correct based on this property and the provided unit tests. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `2` raised to the power of a non-negative integer, which is one less than `n`.

However, we must examine if the property used is indeed correct and applicable. The Binomial Theorem does provide a basis for the property, but let's consider it more closely. For a positive integer `n`, the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n` can help us derive the sum of even and odd binomial coefficients.

When expanding `(1 + 1)^n`, all binomial coefficients (both even and odd indexed) contribute to the sum, resulting in `2^n`. On the other hand, expanding `(1 - 1)^n` causes terms with even indices to have a positive sign, while those with odd indices have a negative sign, resulting in cancellations for odd `n` and a sum of `0` for even `n`. However, considering `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n` together can indeed lead us to the conclusion that the sum of even index coefficients equals the sum of odd index coefficients for a given `n`, but to arrive at `2^(n-1)` specifically requires a bit more nuanced understanding or leveraging of symmetric properties and the fact that the sum of all coefficients is `2^n`.

Considering `(1 + i)^n` and knowing that the sum of even terms minus the sum of odd terms in a binomial expansion can be related to complex numbers (where `i` is the imaginary unit), one can indeed use the properties of complex numbers to derive that the sum of even index binomial coefficients equals `2^(n-1)`. This derivation involves recognizing that the complex expansion of `(1 + i)^n` has real parts corresponding to even index coefficients and imaginary parts corresponding to odd index coefficients, and using properties of complex numbers to identify the pattern that leads to `2^(n-1)`.

Given this analysis and considering the mathematical derivations involved, the original assessment that the function is correct is indeed accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n` equals `2^(n-1)`, as supported by the mathematical background and the annotated version's indication that it computes this value.

Final: **True**
