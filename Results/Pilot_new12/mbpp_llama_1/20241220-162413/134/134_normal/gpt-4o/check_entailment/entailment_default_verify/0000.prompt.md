You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

The mathematical insight behind this problem is that the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a row in Pascal's triangle is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This can be proven using the binomial theorem and properties of binomial coefficients.

The function `func_1(n)` directly returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is the formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

Since the function directly implements the mathematical formula, it works correctly for all positive integer inputs. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the function does not work as expected, and it correctly implements the mathematical formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an integer value representing 2 raised to the power of `n-1`, where `n-1` is a non-negative integer. The function does not modify the input variable `n`, and it does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, implying it may raise an error or produce unexpected results for such inputs. The return value will always be a non-negative integer power of 2, as long as `n` is a positive integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
