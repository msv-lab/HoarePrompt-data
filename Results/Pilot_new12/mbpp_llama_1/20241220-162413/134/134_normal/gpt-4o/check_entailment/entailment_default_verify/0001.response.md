The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides a valid mathematical explanation for why the function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients correctly. The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function.

The output hints provided confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a positive integer `n` and returning an integer value representing 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The hints also note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but since the problem description explicitly states that the input will be a positive integer, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function correctly implements the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients is equal to `2^(n-1)`, and the provided unit tests confirm its correctness.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**.
