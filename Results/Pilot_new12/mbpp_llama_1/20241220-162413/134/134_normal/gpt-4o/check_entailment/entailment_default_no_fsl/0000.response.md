Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the calculation for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

The function uses the property of binomial coefficients that the sum of binomial coefficients of even index is equal to 2^(n-1), where n is the given positive integer. 

The code does not include any error checking for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input is always a valid positive integer.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(4)` returns `8`, which is equal to `2^3`, and `func_1(6)` returns `32`, which is equal to `2^5`. These results match the expected values based on the formula for sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Since the provided code correctly implements the calculation and passes the given unit tests, and we assume the input is always a valid positive integer, the code seems to be correct.
