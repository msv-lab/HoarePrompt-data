Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

In this case, we can use the property of binomial expansion to simplify the problem. The sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(x + y)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)` when `x` and `y` are both equal to 1. 

The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is equivalent to the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given `n`. The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8` and `assert func_1(6) == 32`, also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

Since the function always returns the correct result for any positive integer `n` and we assume that the input will be valid, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
