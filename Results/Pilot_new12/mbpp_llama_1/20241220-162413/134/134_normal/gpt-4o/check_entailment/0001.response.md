Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of `n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property can be proven using the Binomial Theorem.

The Binomial Theorem states that `(x + y)^n = Î£ (n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k`, where the sum is taken over `k` from `0` to `n`. When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the left-hand side becomes `2^n`. When `x = 1` and `y = -1`, the left-hand side becomes `0`. By using these two equations, we can derive the property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this property and returns `2^(n-1)` for a given `n`. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function.

Since the function correctly implements the mathematical property and passes all the provided unit tests, it is correct for all positive integer inputs.
