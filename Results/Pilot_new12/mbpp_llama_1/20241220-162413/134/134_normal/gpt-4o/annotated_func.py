#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of a non-negative integer, which is one less than a positive integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an integer value representing 2 raised to the power of `n-1`, where `n-1` is a non-negative integer. The function does not modify the input variable `n`, and it does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, implying it may raise an error or produce unexpected results for such inputs. The return value will always be a non-negative integer power of 2, as long as `n` is a positive integer.
