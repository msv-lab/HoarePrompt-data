The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns 2 raised to the power of a non-negative integer, which is one less than `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 2 raised to the power of `n-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of `n-1`.**
