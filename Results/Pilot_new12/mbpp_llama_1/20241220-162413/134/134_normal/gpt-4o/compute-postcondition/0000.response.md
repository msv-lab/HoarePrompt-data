The program calculates 2 to the power of `n-1`, where `n` is a positive integer. 
Since `n` is a positive integer, `n-1` will be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2,...). 
The program returns the result of 2 raised to this non-negative integer power.
Output State: **The program returns 2 raised to the power of a non-negative integer, which is one less than a positive integer `n`.**
