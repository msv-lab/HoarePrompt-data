Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's why it works:

1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This allows us to iterate over each digit of the number.
2. The `for digit in str(n)` loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`.
3. The `int(digit)` expression converts each character (digit) back to an integer, so that we can sum them up.
4. The `sum(...)` function calculates the sum of all the digits.

Since the program assumes that the input `n` is a non-negative integer, it does not need to handle cases where `n` is negative or not an integer. Under this assumption, the program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of `n` for all possible inputs.

For example, if `n = 123`, the program will convert it to the string `"123"`, iterate over each character (`"1"`, `"2"`, and `"3"`), convert each character back to an integer (`1`, `2`, and `3`), and sum them up to get `6`, which is the correct result.
