The original assessment is accurate because it correctly explains how the provided function `func_1(n)` works to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

Here's why the original assessment is accurate:
1. The function converts the integer to a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit.
2. It uses a generator expression to convert each character (digit) back to an integer and yields the integer value.
3. The `sum()` function adds up all the integer values yielded by the generator expression, resulting in the sum of the digits of `n`.

The output hints support this assessment, indicating that the function handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, and returns a single integer value representing the sum of all digits. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the input integer `n` and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming it will always receive a non-negative integer.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer), the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.

Final: **True**
