Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. Here's a breakdown of why the function works:

1. The `str(n)` expression converts the integer `n` to a string, allowing us to iterate over each digit.
2. The generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` iterates over each character in the string, converts it back to an integer using `int(digit)`, and yields the integer value.
3. The `sum()` function adds up all the integer values yielded by the generator expression, resulting in the sum of the digits of `n`.

This function works correctly for all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the special case of 0.

For example, if we call `func_1(123)`, the function will correctly return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Similarly, if we call `func_1(0)`, the function will return `0`, which is also correct.

Since we cannot find any potential case where the function does not work as expected, we conclude that the function is correct.
