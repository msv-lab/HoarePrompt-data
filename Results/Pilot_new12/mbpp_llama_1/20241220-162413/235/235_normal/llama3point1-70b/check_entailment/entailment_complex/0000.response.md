Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each digit in the string representation of `n`, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input, which matches the problem description.
2. The function converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`, which allows it to iterate over each digit.
3. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`.
4. Each digit is converted back to an integer using `int(digit)`, which is necessary for summing up the digits.
5. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the digits, which is the desired output.
6. The function returns the sum of the digits as a single integer value, which matches the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of digits of a non-negative integer, it meets the problem description. Additionally, the assumption that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer ensures that the program will not encounter any errors or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description.
