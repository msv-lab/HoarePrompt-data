Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It accomplishes this by first converting the integer into a string, which allows it to iterate over each digit. The `int(digit)` conversion is then used to transform each character (digit) back into an integer, and `sum` is applied to add up these digits.

This approach correctly handles the case for non-negative integers of any length, including zero. For example, `func_1(1234)` will return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, and `func_1(0)` will return `0`, as expected. The function also avoids any potential division by zero or other arithmetic errors since it operates solely on the string representation of the number.

Since the function iterates over each digit exactly once, and correctly converts each character back to an integer for summation, it ensures a correct calculation for all possible non-negative integers. Therefore, without any identifiable edge cases that the function does not handle correctly, the code can be considered correct according to the provided problem description.
