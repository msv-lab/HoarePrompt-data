Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It accomplishes this by first converting the integer into a string, which allows it to iterate over each digit. It then converts each character (digit) back into an integer and sums them all up using the built-in `sum` function in combination with a generator expression.

This approach is straightforward and effectively handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers (e.g., 5) and multi-digit numbers (e.g., 1234). The function does not modify the input integer `n` and always returns a non-negative integer, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given that we assume the input will be valid (i.e., always a non-negative integer), the function does not require error checking for the input type or value. The output hints support this analysis, highlighting that the function correctly calculates the sum of digits for all non-negative integers without modifying the input or performing unnecessary error checking.

Overall, the code is well-structured, readable, and aligns perfectly with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases of valid input.
