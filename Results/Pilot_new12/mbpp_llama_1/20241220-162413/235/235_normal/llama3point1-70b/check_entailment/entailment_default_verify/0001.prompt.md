You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It accomplishes this by first converting the integer into a string, which allows it to iterate over each digit. The `int(digit)` conversion is then used to transform each character (digit) back into an integer, and `sum` is applied to add up these digits.

This approach correctly handles the case for non-negative integers of any length, including zero. For example, `func_1(1234)` will return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, and `func_1(0)` will return `0`, as expected. The function also avoids any potential division by zero or other arithmetic errors since it operates solely on the string representation of the number.

Since the function iterates over each digit exactly once, and correctly converts each character back to an integer for summation, it ensures a correct calculation for all possible non-negative integers. Therefore, without any identifiable edge cases that the function does not handle correctly, the code can be considered correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, and returns a single integer value representing the sum of all digits. The function does not modify the input integer `n` and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming it will always receive a non-negative integer. The function's return value is always a non-negative integer, as the sum of digits of any non-negative integer is also non-negative.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
