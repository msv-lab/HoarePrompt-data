Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It does this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing them up.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function handles all non-negative integers and returns a single integer value representing the sum of all digits. The hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking on the input type, which is a valid assumption given that we are assuming the input will be a valid non-negative integer.

The code correctly handles single-digit and multi-digit numbers, and it does not modify the input integer `n`. The return value is always a non-negative integer, as expected.

For example, if the input is `123`, the function will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is the correct sum of the digits. Similarly, if the input is `9`, the function will return `9`, which is the correct sum of the digits.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
