The initial state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer. The code provided returns the sum of the digits of `n`. 

To calculate this, we first convert `n` to a string, allowing us to iterate over each digit. We then convert each character (digit) back to an integer and sum them up.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the sum of its digits will also be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.**
