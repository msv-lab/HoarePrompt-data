#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, and returns a single integer value representing the sum of all digits. The function does not modify the input integer `n` and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming it will always receive a non-negative integer. The function's return value is always a non-negative integer, as the sum of digits of any non-negative integer is also non-negative.
