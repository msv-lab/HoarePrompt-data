The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `total` is `n % 10`, after executing the code, `n` will be the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10, and `total` remains unchanged as it was calculated before modifying `n`. 

So, the new value of `n` is `n // 10` (where `n` refers to the original value of `n`), and `total` is still equal to the last digit of the original `n`, which is `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10, `total` is the last digit of the original `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
