The code `total += n % 10` increments the value of `total` by the last digit of `n`. The last digit of `n` is `n % 10`. 

Since `n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 100, `n` is less than 100. The value of `total` before the increment was the sum of the last digit of the original `n` and the last digit of `n` before the division.

After the increment, the value of `total` becomes the sum of the last digit of the original `n`, the last digit of `n` before the division, and the last digit of `n`. 

The state of `n` does not change, it is still the integer part of the original `n` divided by 100 and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 100, `n` is greater than 0, and `total` is the sum of the last digit of the original `n`, the last digit of `n` before the division, and the last digit of `n`.**
