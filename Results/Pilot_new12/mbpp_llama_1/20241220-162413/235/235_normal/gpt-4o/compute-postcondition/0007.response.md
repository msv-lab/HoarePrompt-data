According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 100, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop can execute again. The condition will be met as long as the division result is greater than 0. 
State: **`n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 100, `total` is the sum of the last digit of the original `n` and the last digit of `n` before the division, and `n` is greater than 0**
