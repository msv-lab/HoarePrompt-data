To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the variables `n` and `total`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
while n > 0:
    total += n % 10
    n //= 10
```

From the given output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `n` is repeatedly divided by 10 (integer division `//=`), effectively removing the last digit.
2. `total` accumulates the last digit of `n` at each iteration, which is obtained by `n % 10`.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer and the loop continues as long as `n > 0`, we can infer the following:

- The loop will continue to execute until `n` becomes 0, at which point it will stop because the condition `n > 0` will no longer be true.
- At each iteration, `total` will accumulate the last digit of the current value of `n`.
- By the time the loop finishes, `n` will be 0 because the loop iterates until `n` is reduced to 0 through the repeated division by 10.

Considering the pattern of accumulation in `total`, it will sum up all the digits of the original `n`. This is because `n % 10` gives the last digit of `n`, and `n //= 10` effectively moves to the next digit in the following iteration, until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` becomes 0).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is that `n` will be 0, and `total` will be the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`**
