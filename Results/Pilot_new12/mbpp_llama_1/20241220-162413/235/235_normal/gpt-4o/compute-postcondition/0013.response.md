Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`. This includes handling edge cases where `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 0, as there are no digits to sum. The function effectively calculates and returns a single numerical value that represents the sum of all digits in the input number `n`, regardless of the initial value of `n`.**
