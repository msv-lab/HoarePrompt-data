The code `total += n % 10` increments the value of `total` by the remainder of `n` divided by 10. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `n % 10` will be the last digit of `n`, which is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), but since `n` is greater than 0, `n % 10` will be an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

The initial value of `total` is 0. After executing the code, `total` becomes `0 + (n % 10)`, which simplifies to `n % 10`. 

The state of `n` does not change, so `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `total` is equal to the last digit of `n`, i.e., `n % 10`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is `n % 10`**
