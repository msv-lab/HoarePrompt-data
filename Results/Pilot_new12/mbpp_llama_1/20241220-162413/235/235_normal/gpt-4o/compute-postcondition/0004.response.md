According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10, this implies that the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10 must be greater than 0. This means the original `n` must have been at least 10. 

State: **`n` is the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10, `total` is the last digit of the original `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
