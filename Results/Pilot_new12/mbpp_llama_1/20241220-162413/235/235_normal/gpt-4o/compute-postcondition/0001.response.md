According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer. Since a non-negative integer includes 0, this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is 0**
