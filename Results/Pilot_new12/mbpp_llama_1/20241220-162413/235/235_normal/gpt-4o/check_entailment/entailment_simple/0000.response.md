Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
- It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained by `n % 10`) to `total`.
- It then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`).
- This process repeats until `n` is 0, at which point `total` contains the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.
- Finally, it returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the input integer.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for specific cases. The function correctly handles non-negative integers by summing their digits, which aligns with the problem description. 

For example, given the input `345`, the function correctly calculates the sum as `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`, which matches the expected output in the problem description. This consistent behavior across different inputs makes the program correct according to the problem description.
