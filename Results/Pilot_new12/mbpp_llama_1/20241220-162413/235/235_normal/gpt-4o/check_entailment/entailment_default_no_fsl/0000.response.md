Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a simple and effective solution to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

* The function uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number `n` using the modulo operator (`n % 10`) and add it to the total sum.
* The number `n` is then divided by 10 using integer division (`n //= 10`) to effectively remove the last digit.
* The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed and the total sum is returned.
* The function correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 0, as there are no digits to sum.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs. Since the code is simple and well-structured, and the unit tests cover different cases, it's reasonable to conclude that the function works correctly for all non-negative integer inputs.

Moreover, the output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the function's behavior, including its handling of edge cases. Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
