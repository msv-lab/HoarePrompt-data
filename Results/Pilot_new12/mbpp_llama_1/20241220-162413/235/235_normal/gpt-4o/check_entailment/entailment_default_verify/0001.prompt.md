You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns the result. This is achieved through a while loop that continuously removes the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`) and adds it to the running total, then removes this digit from the original number (using `n //= 10`). This process repeats until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` becomes 0).

The given assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function with various inputs, and upon examination, the code handles these and other potential cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases like the number 0 (although this case is not explicitly tested, the function would return 0 as expected, because the while loop would not execute and the function would return the initial value of `total`, which is 0).

Without being able to find a case where the program fails to meet the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`. This includes handling edge cases where `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 0, as there are no digits to sum. The function effectively calculates and returns a single numerical value that represents the sum of all digits in the input number `n`, regardless of the initial value of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
