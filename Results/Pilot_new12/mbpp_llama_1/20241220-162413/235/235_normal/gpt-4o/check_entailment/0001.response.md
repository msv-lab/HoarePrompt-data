Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns the result. This is achieved through a while loop that continuously removes the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`) and adds it to the running total, then removes this digit from the original number (using `n //= 10`). This process repeats until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` becomes 0).

The given assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function with various inputs, and upon examination, the code handles these and other potential cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases like the number 0 (although this case is not explicitly tested, the function would return 0 as expected, because the while loop would not execute and the function would return the initial value of `total`, which is 0).

Without being able to find a case where the program fails to meet the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
