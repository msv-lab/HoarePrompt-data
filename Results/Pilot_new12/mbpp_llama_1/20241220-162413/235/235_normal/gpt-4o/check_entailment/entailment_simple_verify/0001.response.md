To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
2. **Original Assessment:** The assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the given code and assertions. It explains how the function works by iterating through each digit of the input number, adding it to a total, and then removing that digit from the number until all digits have been processed.
3. **Annotated Code:** The annotated code provides the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a non-negative integer. After the loop has been executed, `n` is 0, and `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

**Analysis:**

- The provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) demonstrate the functionality of the function with various inputs. For example, `func_1(345)` should return `3+4+5 = 12`, which it does, supporting the correctness of the function for multi-digit numbers.
- The function iterates through each digit of the number by using the modulo operator (`n % 10`) to get the last digit and then integer division (`n //= 10`) to remove the last digit. This process is repeated until there are no more digits left (`n > 0`), which ensures all digits are processed.
- The annotated states are consistent with the expected behavior of the function. Before the loop, `n` is indeed a non-negative integer, and after the loop, `n` becomes 0 while `total` accumulates the sum of the digits.
- The function handles the case for single-digit numbers implicitly, as the loop will execute once and then terminate, returning the single digit as the sum. Although the original assessment mentions the function would correctly handle the number 0 by returning 0 without explicit testing, this is indeed true because the while loop condition (`n > 0`) would be false from the start, and the function would return the initial value of `total`, which is 0.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations support the correctness by describing the states of the program that align with the expected functionality. The original assessment is accurate in its conclusion that the program works as expected for the given problem description.

Therefore, considering all the information and analysis provided:

Final: **True**
