Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function called `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

The function works by using a while loop to iterate over each digit in the number `n`. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` to a running total and then removes the last digit from `n`. This process continues until all digits have been processed, at which point the function returns the total sum of the digits.

This function covers all cases as specified in the problem description:
- It handles non-negative integers of any size, as the while loop will continue until all digits have been processed.
- It correctly calculates the sum of the digits by using the modulo operator (`n % 10`) to get the last digit and integer division (`n //= 10`) to remove the last digit.
- It returns the sum of the digits as an integer, which matches the expected output type.

Additionally, the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, further supporting the conclusion that the function is correct.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and no counterexample can be found, it is considered correct.
