Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment makes sense. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment by providing the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is indeed a non-negative integer. After the loop has been executed, `n` is 0, and `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`, which is the expected behavior.

The annotations support the correctness of the program by showing that the loop correctly processes each digit of the input number and that the `total` variable accurately accumulates the sum of these digits.

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program's behavior, including its handling of non-negative integers of any size, its correct calculation of the sum of the digits, and its return of the sum as an integer.

Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate and should be maintained.

Final: **True**
