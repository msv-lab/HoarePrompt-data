Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Handling Non-Negative Integers**: The program assumes that the input `n` is a non-negative integer. It handles this requirement by using a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.

2. **Calculating Sum of Digits**: Inside the loop, it uses the modulo operator (`n % 10`) to extract the last digit of the number and adds it to the `total`. Then, it uses integer division (`n //= 10`) to remove the last digit from the number. This process repeats until all digits have been processed.

3. **Edge Case**: When `n` is 0, the while loop doesn't execute because the condition `n > 0` is not met, and the function returns `0`, which is the correct sum for a number with no digits.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) all pass with the given implementation, further confirming its correctness for specific cases.

5. **Function Behavior**: The function behaves as described in the problem statement, accepting a non-negative integer `n` and returning the sum of its digits, including handling the edge case where `n` is 0.

In conclusion, given that the input will always be valid (a non-negative integer), the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, making it correct according to the provided specification.
