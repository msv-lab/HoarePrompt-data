You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function called `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

The function works by using a while loop to iterate over each digit in the number `n`. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` to a running total and then removes the last digit from `n`. This process continues until all digits have been processed, at which point the function returns the total sum of the digits.

This function covers all cases as specified in the problem description:
- It handles non-negative integers of any size, as the while loop will continue until all digits have been processed.
- It correctly calculates the sum of the digits by using the modulo operator (`n % 10`) to get the last digit and integer division (`n //= 10`) to remove the last digit.
- It returns the sum of the digits as an integer, which matches the expected output type.

Additionally, the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, further supporting the conclusion that the function is correct.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and no counterexample can be found, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`. This includes handling edge cases where `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 0, as there are no digits to sum. The function effectively calculates and returns a single numerical value that represents the sum of all digits in the input number `n`, regardless of the initial value of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
