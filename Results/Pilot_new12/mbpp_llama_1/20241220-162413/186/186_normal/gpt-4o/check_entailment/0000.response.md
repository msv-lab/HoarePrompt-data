Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly extract the element-wise minimum between two tuples. The function is currently performing a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between the corresponding elements of the two tuples. This is not equivalent to finding the minimum value between two elements.

For example, if we call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the function should return `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, which are the element-wise minimum values between the two tuples. However, the function actually returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which are the results of the bitwise AND operations.

To correctly implement the function, we should use the `min` function in combination with the `zip` function to compare corresponding elements from the two tuples:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(min(a, b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
