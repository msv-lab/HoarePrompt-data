Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

The bitwise AND operation (&) is a binary operation that takes two integers as input and returns an integer where each bit is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in both input integers are 1. This is not what the problem description is asking for.

To meet the problem description, the function should return a tuple where each element is the result of a comparison or operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples, but the problem description does not specify what this operation should be.

For example, if the problem description meant to ask for a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding element in the first tuple is greater than the corresponding element in the second tuple, and 0 otherwise, the function could be implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(1 if a > b else 0 for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

Or, if the problem description meant to ask for a tuple where each element is the minimum or maximum of the corresponding elements in the two input tuples, the function could be implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(min(a, b) for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

or

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(max(a, b) for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

However, without further clarification of what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means, it is impossible to provide a correct implementation that meets the problem description.
