Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two input tuples, which does not align with the problem description. The code does not extract or return tuples as specified in the problem, but rather returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND results.

The output hints also suggest that the code is performing a bitwise AND operation, which further reinforces the idea that the code does not match the problem description. There is no indication in the code or the output hints that it is attempting to extract or return tuples as required.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, making it incorrect. A correct solution would involve extracting and returning the corresponding elements from the two input tuples, not performing a bitwise AND operation.
