Correctness: **False**

The given program does not perform the task described in the problem statement. The problem asks for a function that extracts the element-wise difference and also works with tuples, but the provided function uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to compare elements from the two tuples, rather than calculating the difference.

The function should return a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in the input tuples. However, the given function returns the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements, which is not the same as the difference.

For example, if the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the function should return a tuple like (5, 2, 3, 6) (assuming the difference is calculated as the absolute difference), but the given function returns (0, 0, 2, 1) which is incorrect.

A correct implementation of the function would be:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(abs(a - b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This function uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the input tuples, and returns a tuple of these differences.
