Correctness: **False**

The code does not extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples as stated in the problem description. Instead, it performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

The bitwise AND operation is a binary operation that takes two integers as input and produces an integer output. It is not related to extracting tuples.

For example, if we have two tuples: (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the function will return (0, 0, 2, 1) which is the result of the bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples, not the extracted elementwise and tuples.

A correct implementation of the function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples would involve comparing the elements of the two tuples, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the code is not correct according to the problem description.
