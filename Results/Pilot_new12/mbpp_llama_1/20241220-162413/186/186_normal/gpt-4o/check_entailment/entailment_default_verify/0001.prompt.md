You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not perform the task described in the problem statement. The problem asks for a function that extracts the element-wise difference and also works with tuples, but the provided function uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to compare elements from the two tuples, rather than calculating the difference.

The function should return a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in the input tuples. However, the given function returns the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements, which is not the same as the difference.

For example, if the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the function should return a tuple like (5, 2, 3, 6) (assuming the difference is calculated as the absolute difference), but the given function returns (0, 0, 2, 1) which is incorrect.

A correct implementation of the function would be:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(abs(a - b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This function uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the input tuples, and returns a tuple of these differences.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two input tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the results. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length, as it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements in parallel. If the tuples are of unequal length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input tuples contain non-integer values, as the bitwise AND operation is only defined for integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the return of a tuple containing the bitwise AND results, with the original input tuples remaining unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
