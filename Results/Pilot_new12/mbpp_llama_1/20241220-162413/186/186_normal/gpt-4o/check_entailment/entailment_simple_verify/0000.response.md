The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False**, which means the program does not correctly extract the element-wise minimum between two tuples. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code.

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, we see that the function `func_1` is performing a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The annotation correctly notes that the program returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

However, the problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise minimum between two tuples. The element-wise minimum is typically obtained by comparing corresponding elements of the two input tuples and selecting the smaller value. This is not what the provided code does.

Given this information, we can conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the function as described in the problem description. The provided code performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not the same as finding the element-wise minimum.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, we maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
