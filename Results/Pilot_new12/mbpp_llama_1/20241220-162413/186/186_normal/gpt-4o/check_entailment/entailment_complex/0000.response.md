Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description says. The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the program performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two input tuples.

The problem description is not clear about what "elementwise and tuples" means, but based on the standard interpretation of "elementwise" operations, it would typically refer to performing a specific operation (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.) between corresponding elements of the tuples.

In contrast, the program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform a binary operation between corresponding elements of the tuples. This operation is not typically referred to as "elementwise and" in the context of tuples.

The program would be correct if the problem description asked to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two input tuples, but that is not what the problem description says.

To make the program correct, it would need to be revised to perform the operation specified in the problem description, which is currently unclear. If the intention is to perform an elementwise logical AND operation (i.e., `and` operation) between corresponding elements of the tuples, the program would need to be modified to use the `and` operator instead of the `&` operator. However, this would require the elements of the tuples to be boolean values, not integers.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to perform an elementwise logical AND operation between corresponding elements of the tuples, assuming the elements are boolean values:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a and b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

But again, this is not what the original program does, and the correct implementation depends on the intended meaning of "elementwise and tuples" in the problem description.
