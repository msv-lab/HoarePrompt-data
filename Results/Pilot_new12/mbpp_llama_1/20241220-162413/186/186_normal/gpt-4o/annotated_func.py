#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two input tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the results. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length, as it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements in parallel. If the tuples are of unequal length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input tuples contain non-integer values, as the bitwise AND operation is only defined for integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the return of a tuple containing the bitwise AND results, with the original input tuples remaining unchanged.
