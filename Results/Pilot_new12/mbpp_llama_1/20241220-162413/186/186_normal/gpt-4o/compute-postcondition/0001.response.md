The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, both of which are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two tuple parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.**
