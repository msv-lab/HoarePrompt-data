Correctness: **False**

The program is attempting to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation on two tuples, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem description. The description asks for element-wise and tuples, not a bitwise AND operation.

A correct implementation would involve creating a new tuple with elements that are tuples themselves, where each inner tuple contains one element from each of the input tuples.

For example, given the input tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the correct output would be `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))`.

However, the provided program would return `(0, 0, 0)` for the same input, because the bitwise AND operation `&` is being used, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this, the program should use the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from the input tuples, and then create a new tuple with these pairs. The corrected program would look like this:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```
