Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided function calculates the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the input tuples, not the element-wise and operation.

The function uses the `&` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation, whereas the problem description implies that a logical AND operation should be performed, which would return `True` if both elements are true and `False` otherwise.

For example, if the input tuples are `(True, True, False)` and `(True, False, True)`, the function will return a tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operation, not the logical AND operation. The correct output should be `(True, False, False)`, but the function will return a tuple containing the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements.

To meet the requirements, the function should be modified to use the `and` operator instead of the `&` operator to perform a logical AND operation. The corrected function would be:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x and y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```
