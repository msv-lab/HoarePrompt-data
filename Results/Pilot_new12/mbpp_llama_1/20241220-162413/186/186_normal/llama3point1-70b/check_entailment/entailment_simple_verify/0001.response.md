The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it performs a bitwise AND operation instead of creating tuples of corresponding elements from the input tuples. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description, which asks for element-wise and tuples.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, as it states that the program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. This is not the expected behavior based on the problem description.

The correct implementation, as mentioned in the original assessment, would involve using the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from the input tuples and creating a new tuple with these pairs. The corrected program would look like this:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```
This would produce the expected output of `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))` for the input tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`.

Since the original program does not meet the problem description, and the annotated version confirms this, the original assessment of **False** is maintained.

Final: **False**
