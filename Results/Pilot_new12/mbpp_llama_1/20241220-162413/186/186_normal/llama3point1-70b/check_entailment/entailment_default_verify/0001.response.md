The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, which implies that the function should return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains one element from each of the input tuples.

However, the provided program performs an element-wise bitwise AND operation on two tuples, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem description. The bitwise AND operation `&` is a binary operator that compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

The output hints provided support the original assessment that the program is performing a bitwise AND operation on the input tuples, which is not the intended behavior.

Given the problem description and the output hints, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements. The correct implementation, as mentioned in the original assessment, would involve creating a new tuple with elements that are tuples themselves, where each inner tuple contains one element from each of the input tuples.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment, `def func_1(tup1, tup2): return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))`, is a correct implementation of the problem description. 

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**.
