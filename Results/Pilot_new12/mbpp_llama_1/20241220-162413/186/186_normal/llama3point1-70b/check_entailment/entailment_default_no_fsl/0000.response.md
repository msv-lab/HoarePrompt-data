Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The function is designed to perform a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from two tuples, but the problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

The function assumes that both input tuples are of the same length, and if they are of different lengths, it will ignore the extra elements in the longer tuple. However, the problem description does not mention anything about performing bitwise AND operations or handling tuples of different lengths.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input tuples contain non-integer values, such as strings or floats. The bitwise AND operation (`&`) is not defined for these types, and the function will raise a TypeError.

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, '6')`, the function will raise an error when trying to perform the bitwise AND operation on the third elements of the tuples.

To fix this, the function should be modified to handle non-integer values and to extract the elementwise and tuples as specified in the problem description. However, based on the provided code and output hints, the function does not meet the requirements, so its correctness is **False**.
