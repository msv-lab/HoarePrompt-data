You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples are of the same length, as it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements in parallel. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. The returned tuple will contain the bitwise AND of corresponding elements, where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The function does not modify the original input tuples.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
