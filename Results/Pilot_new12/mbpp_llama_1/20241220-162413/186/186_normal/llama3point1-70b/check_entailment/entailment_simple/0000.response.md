Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description because the problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the program actually performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the two tuples.

In Python, the `&` operator is used for bitwise AND operation, which is not the same as elementwise operation for tuples. Elementwise operation would typically involve operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication of corresponding elements from two tuples.

A correct implementation would depend on the specific elementwise operation to be performed. For example, if we want to add corresponding elements from two tuples, the function would look like this:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x + y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This function would return a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. 

In the given program, there is also no indication of extracting tuples, which can be done by just returning the input tuples or zipping them together if needed. 

The problem description seems to be unclear about what is meant by "extract the elementwise and tuples". If it is asking to return the input tuples, the function would be:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tup1, tup2
```

If the intention was to perform an elementwise operation on the tuples, the function would depend on the specific operation to be performed. Without a clear description of the intended operation, it's impossible to determine the correct implementation.
