Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples are of the same length, as it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements in parallel. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. The returned tuple will contain the bitwise AND of corresponding elements, where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The function does not modify the original input tuples.**
