Correctness: **True**.

The provided code `func_1(d, n)` is a Python function that filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this. 

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- It iterates through each key-value pair `(k, v)` in the dictionary `d`.
- For each pair, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If the condition is met, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary; otherwise, it is excluded.
- The function returns the new dictionary with the filtered entries.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result for an empty input.
- Dictionaries with no values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with a mix of values greater than or equal to `n` and values less than `n`: The function will return a dictionary with only the entries that have values greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

Since the code handles all these cases correctly and does not have any apparent errors or edge cases that it does not handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
