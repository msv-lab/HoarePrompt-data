Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary and includes the pair in the output dictionary only if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

This function handles all potential cases, including empty dictionaries, dictionaries with no values meeting the condition, and dictionaries with non-integer values (which will be included or excluded based on their numeric value). 

For example, if we call `func_1({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, 2)`, the function will correctly return `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`. 

Since the function behaves as described in the problem description for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
