Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: Although the function does not explicitly validate the input types, the problem description assumes that the input will be valid. Therefore, we can assume that `d` will always be a dictionary and `n` will always be an integer.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as:
   - An empty input dictionary `d`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.
   - A threshold `n` that is greater than all values in `d`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.
   - A threshold `n` that is less than or equal to all values in `d`: The function will return a dictionary containing all key-value pairs from `d`, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the function correctly implements the required behavior, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
