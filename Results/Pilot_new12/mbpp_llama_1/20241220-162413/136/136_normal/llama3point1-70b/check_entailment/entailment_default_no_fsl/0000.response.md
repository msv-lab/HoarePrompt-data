Correctness: **True**

The code defines a function `func_1` that filters a given dictionary `d` based on a threshold value `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The code correctly handles edge cases such as an empty input dictionary, a threshold value greater than all values in the dictionary, and a threshold value less than or equal to all values in the dictionary. In these cases, it returns an empty dictionary, all key-value pairs, or any other subset of key-value pairs that meet the condition, respectively.

The code works as follows:

- It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to the threshold `n`.
- The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`, as it returns a new dictionary object containing the filtered data.
- The function handles dictionaries with various types of comparable values (not just integers), as the comparison `v >= n` can be applied to values of different numeric types.
- Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not consider cases such as non-numeric values in the dictionary that might cause a TypeError when compared to `n`, or cases where `d` is not a dictionary or `n` is not an integer.

In summary, the provided code meets all requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
