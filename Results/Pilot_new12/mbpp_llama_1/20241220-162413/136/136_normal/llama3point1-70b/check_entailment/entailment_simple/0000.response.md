Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

This is achieved using a dictionary comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new dictionary by iterating over the key-value pairs of the original dictionary and applying a filter condition. In this case, the filter condition is `v >= n`, which ensures that only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the resulting dictionary.

The program will work correctly for any valid input, as long as the dictionary values are comparable to integers. The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, so we don't need to consider cases where the dictionary values are not comparable to integers or where the input is not a dictionary or an integer. 

Therefore, the program accurately implements the required functionality and meets the requirements of the problem description.
