The dictionary `d` contains key-value pairs where all values are comparable to integers. The variable `n` is an integer. The code iterates through each key-value pair in `d` and includes the pair in the new dictionary if and only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Output State: **The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to integer `n`.**
