This function filters a given dictionary `d` based on a threshold value `n`, returning a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function accepts two parameters: a dictionary `d` with values that can be compared to integers, and an integer `n`. It returns a dictionary containing the filtered key-value pairs. The final state of the program after execution will be a new dictionary object containing the filtered data, without modifying the original dictionary `d`. The function handles edge cases where the input dictionary `d` may be empty or where the threshold `n` may be greater than, less than, or equal to all values in the dictionary, as it will simply return an empty dictionary if no values meet the condition, or return all key-value pairs if the threshold is less than or equal to all values in the dictionary.
