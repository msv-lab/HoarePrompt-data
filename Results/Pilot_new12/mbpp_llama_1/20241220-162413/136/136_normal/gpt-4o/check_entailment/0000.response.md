Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a Python function named `func_1` that filters a dictionary based on the provided integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. For example, when `n` is 170, the function returns a dictionary with all entries where the value is 170 or more. When `n` is 180, the function returns a dictionary with only the entries where the value is 180 or more.

After reviewing the code, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles different values of `n` and dictionaries with various entries correctly. It also handles edge cases, such as when `n` is greater than all values in the dictionary, in which case it returns an empty dictionary.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
