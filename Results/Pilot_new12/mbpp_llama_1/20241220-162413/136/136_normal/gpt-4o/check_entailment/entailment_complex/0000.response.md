Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through the use of a dictionary comprehension, which filters the key-value pairs based on the condition `v >= n`.

The program handles all cases specified in the problem description, including:

* Filtering the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`
* Returning a dictionary containing the filtered key-value pairs
* Leaving the original dictionary `d` unchanged
* Handling any type of dictionary and integer input, including empty dictionaries and negative integers
* Returning an empty dictionary if the input integer `n` is greater than all values in the dictionary

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as they cover various scenarios, such as:

* Filtering a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs
* Filtering a dictionary with a single key-value pair
* Filtering an empty dictionary

In all cases, the program behaves as expected and returns the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
