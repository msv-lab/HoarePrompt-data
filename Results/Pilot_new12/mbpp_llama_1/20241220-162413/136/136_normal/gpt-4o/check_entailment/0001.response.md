Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. The function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various cases. For example, when `n` is 170, the function correctly returns a dictionary with the entries for 'Cierra Vega', 'Alden Cantrell', and 'Pierre Cox'. When `n` is 180, the function returns a dictionary with only the entries for 'Alden Cantrell' and 'Pierre Cox', which is also correct. Similarly, when `n` is 190, the function returns a dictionary with only the entry for 'Pierre Cox', which is the expected result.

Additionally, the function handles empty dictionaries and dictionaries with no entries that meet the condition correctly. For instance, `func_1({}, 10)` returns an empty dictionary `{}`, and `func_1({'a': 5}, 10)` also returns an empty dictionary `{}`, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
