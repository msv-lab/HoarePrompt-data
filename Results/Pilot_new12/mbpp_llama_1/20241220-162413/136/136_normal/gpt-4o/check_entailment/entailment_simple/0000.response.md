Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

Here is why it works:

1. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs from `d` where each value is greater than or equal to `n`.
2. The condition `v >= n` in the dictionary comprehension ensures that only key-value pairs with values meeting this condition are included in the new dictionary.
3. The function returns this new dictionary, which contains only the filtered key-value pairs.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example:

- `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170)` returns `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is the expected result because only these values are greater than or equal to 170.
- `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 180)` returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is the expected result because only these values are greater than or equal to 180.
- `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 190)` returns `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is the expected result because only this value is greater than or equal to 190.

Overall, the function works as expected and correctly filters the dictionary based on the provided condition.
