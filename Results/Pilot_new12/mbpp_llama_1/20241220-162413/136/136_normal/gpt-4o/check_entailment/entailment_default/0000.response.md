Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary and only includes pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The code also handles edge cases, such as empty dictionaries and negative integers, as described in the problem description. Additionally, the code does not modify the original dictionary, which aligns with the problem description. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs. The function also correctly returns an empty dictionary when `n` is greater than all values in the dictionary, and it would raise a `TypeError` if the dictionary contains non-integer or non-comparable values, which is consistent with the output hints. 

It is worth noting that since we assume the input will be valid, the code not handling cases where the input dictionary contains non-comparable values or the input `n` is not an integer is not considered incorrect, as these cases are outside the scope of the problem description.
