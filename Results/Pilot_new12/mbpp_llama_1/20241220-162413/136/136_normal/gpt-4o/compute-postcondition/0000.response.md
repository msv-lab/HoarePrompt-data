To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state. The initial state specifies that `d` is a dictionary and `n` is an integer. The code snippet uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given this, the program will return a dictionary that contains a subset of the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d`. Specifically, it will include only those pairs where the value is greater than or equal to the integer `n`.

Output State: **The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where each value is greater than or equal to the integer `n`.**
