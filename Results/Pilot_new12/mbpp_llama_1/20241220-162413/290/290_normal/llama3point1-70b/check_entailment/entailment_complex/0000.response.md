Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

Here is why:

1. The function splits the input string into words using the `split()` method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item.
2. It then checks each word to see if its length is more than 1 character and if 'z' is in the middle characters (excluding the first and last characters) of the word. This is done using `word[1:-1]`, which returns a slice of the word starting from the second character to the second last character.
3. If a word with 'z' in its middle characters is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
4. If no word with 'z' in its middle characters is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The program handles strings with any number of words and any length of words, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with multiple spaces between words.

The problem description does not specify what to do if the input string is `None` or not a string, and the program may raise an error in these cases. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
