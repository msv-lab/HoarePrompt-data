Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of a word. Here's why I believe the function works correctly:

1. **Splitting the string into words**: The function first splits the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split` method. This is a standard approach to handle strings containing multiple words.

2. **Checking each word**: The function then iterates over each word in the list. For each word, it checks two conditions:
   - `len(word) > 1`: This condition ensures that the word has more than one character. This is crucial because the problem description requires 'z' to be present except at the start and end of the word. In a single-character word, 'z' would inherently be at both the start and end.
   - `'z' in word[1:-1]`: This condition checks if 'z' is present anywhere in the word except the first and last characters. The slicing (`word[1:-1]`) removes the first and last characters, and the `in` operator checks if 'z' is in the remaining substring.

3. **Handling edge cases**: 
   - **Empty string**: If the input string is empty, `s.split()` returns an empty list, and the `for` loop doesn't execute. The function correctly returns `False` for an empty string.
   - **Single-character words**: For words with only one character, the condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that these words are skipped. Thus, the function handles single-character words correctly.
   - **Words without 'z'**: If no word contains 'z' except at the start or end, the function will iterate through all words and return `False`, which is the correct behavior.

Given the logic of the function and how it handles various edge cases, I could not find an example where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
