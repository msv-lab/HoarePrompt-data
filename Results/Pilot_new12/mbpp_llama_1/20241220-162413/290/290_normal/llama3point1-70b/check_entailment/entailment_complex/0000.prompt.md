You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the original string, `words` is the list of words equal to `s.split()`, and `word` is either the last word in `words` if the loop completed without returning `True`, or the word that caused the early return if such a word exists; the function returns `True` if a word with 'z' in its middle characters was found, otherwise, it implicitly returns `None`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether any word in the string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters. The function splits the input string into words and checks each word. If a word has more than one character and 'z' is found in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The original input string `s` remains unchanged throughout the process. The function handles strings with any number of words and any length of words, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with multiple spaces between words. The function's return value is `True` if a word with 'z' in its middle is found, and `False` otherwise. Note that if the input string is `None` or not a string, the function may raise an error, as this case is not explicitly handled in the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
