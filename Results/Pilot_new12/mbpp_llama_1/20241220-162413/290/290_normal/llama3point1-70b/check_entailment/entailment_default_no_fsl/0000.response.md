Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The program splits the input string into words and checks each word. If a word has more than one character and 'z' is found in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. 

The function handles strings with any number of words and any length of words, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with multiple spaces between words. The function's return value is `True` if a word with 'z' in its middle is found, and `False` otherwise.

The function's logic is correct and it covers all potential cases as described in the problem description. The program does not need to handle invalid inputs like `None` or non-string inputs, as it is assumed that the input will be valid. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case. 

For example, the function will correctly return `True` for the string "fiz buzz" because the word "fiz" has a 'z' in its middle, and it will correctly return `False` for the string "fizz buzz" because the 'z's in "fizz" are at the start and end of the word.
