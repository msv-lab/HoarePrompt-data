Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(s)` checks if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. It splits the input string `s` into words and then checks each word. If a word has more than one character and contains 'z' in any position except the first and last character, the function immediately returns `True`. If it checks all words without finding such a 'z', it returns `False`.

This function handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It correctly identifies strings that contain 'z' in the middle of any word and does not incorrectly identify strings that do not contain 'z' in the middle of any word. It also handles edge cases such as empty strings, strings with a single word, words with only one character, and words that start or end with 'z' but do not contain 'z' in the middle.

For example, the function would correctly return `True` for the strings "baz", "foo z bar", and "xyzzy", but would correctly return `False` for the strings "z", "zoo", and "foo". It also correctly handles strings with multiple words, such as "hello z world" and "no z here". 

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and does not contain any logical errors, it is correct according to the problem description.
