According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop can execute. Since `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()`, for the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one word or be a non-empty string with a space, and `words` must have at least 1 word. At the start of the loop, `word` should be the first word in the `words` list.

State: **`s` is a string that must be non-empty or contain at least one space, `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the `words` list**
