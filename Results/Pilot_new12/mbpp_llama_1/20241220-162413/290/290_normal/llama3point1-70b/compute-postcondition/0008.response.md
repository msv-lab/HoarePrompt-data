According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 3 words, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string containing at least one space, `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()` with at least 2 words, and `word` is the second word in the `words` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 words and the `word` is the third word in the `words` list.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing at least one space, `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()` with at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in the `words` list**
