The code `words = s.split()` splits the string `s` into a list of words, using whitespace as the delimiter. 

The value of `s` is still a string. A new variable `words` is created and is assigned the list of words from the string `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()`.**
