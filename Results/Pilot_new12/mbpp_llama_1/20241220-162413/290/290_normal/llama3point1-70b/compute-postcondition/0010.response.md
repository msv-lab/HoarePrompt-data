Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing at least one space, `words` is a list of words equal to `s.split()` with at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in the `words` list. If the length of `word` is more than 1 and 'z' is in the characters of `word` excluding the first and last characters, the program returns True. Otherwise, the program returns None.***
