Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the character 'z' exists in the substring of the input string `s`, excluding the first and last characters. This is done by using the expression `s[1:-1]`, which slices the string to exclude the first and last characters, and then checking if 'z' is in this substring using the `in` operator.

The function returns `True` if 'z' is found in this substring and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description. The provided unit tests also confirm this behavior, such as `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` and `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`, which demonstrate that the function correctly handles cases where 'z' is present or absent in the specified substring.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string is empty or has only one or two characters, because the slicing operation `s[1:-1]` will either return an empty string or the entire string (if it has only one character), and the `in` operator will correctly return `False` for an empty string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution according to the problem description.
