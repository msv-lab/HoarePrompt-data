Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string. It then checks if 'z' is in this sliced substring using the `in` operator.

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Exclusion of the first and last characters**: By using `s[1:-1]`, the function effectively excludes the first and last characters of the string from the check. This meets the problem description's requirement to ignore 'z' at the start and end of the word.

2. **Presence of 'z' in the substring**: The function returns `True` as soon as it finds 'z' in the sliced substring, indicating that 'z' is present somewhere in the middle of the string.

3. **Return False if 'z' is not found**: If 'z' is not found in the sliced substring, the function returns `False`, correctly handling cases where 'z' is either at the start, end, or not present in the string.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases.
