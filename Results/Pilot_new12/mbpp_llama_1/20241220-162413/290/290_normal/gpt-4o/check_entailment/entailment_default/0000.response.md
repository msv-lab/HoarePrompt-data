Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. It checks if the character 'z' exists in the substring of the input string `s`, excluding the first and last characters, which matches the problem description. The function returns `True` if 'z' is found in this substring and `False` otherwise. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the code. For example, `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters, and `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases where the input string is empty, has only one or two characters, or does not contain 'z' in the specified substring.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a string or is an empty string with no characters to exclude. Therefore, based on the problem description and output hints, the code seems to be correct for every potential case.
