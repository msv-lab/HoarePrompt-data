Correctness: **True**

The program checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word, by using Python's string slicing feature to exclude the first and last characters of the string. The code `s[1:-1]` returns a new string that includes all characters of `s` except the first and last characters. The `in` operator then checks if 'z' is present in this new string. 

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string, `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, and `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present at all.

After analyzing the code and considering different potential cases, it appears that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly handles strings with 'z' in the middle, strings with 'z' at the start or end, and strings without 'z'. Therefore, the program is correct.
