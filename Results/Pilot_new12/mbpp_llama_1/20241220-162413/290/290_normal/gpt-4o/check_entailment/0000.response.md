Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, accurately checks if a string contains 'z' in any position except at the start and end of the word. It achieves this by using Python's list slicing feature to exclude the first and last characters of the string (`s[1:-1]`) and then checking if 'z' is present in the remaining substring.

This function correctly handles all potential cases:

- If 'z' is present in the middle of the string, it returns `True`.
- If 'z' is present at the start or end of the string, it correctly ignores these positions and checks the rest of the string.
- If 'z' is not present in the string at all, it returns `False`.

Given the simplicity and correctness of the implementation, it addresses the problem description accurately without any observable flaws or edge cases that it does not handle.
