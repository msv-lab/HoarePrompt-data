#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of the even numbers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter, a positive integer `n`, and returns the sum of the cubes of the even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), calculated as the sum of the cubes of the sequence of numbers generated by `(2 * i)` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, it returns a single value representing the sum of the cubes of the specified even numbers, leaving the input variable `n` unchanged.
