Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter, a positive integer `n`, and returns the sum of the cubes of the even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), calculated as the sum of the cubes of the sequence of numbers generated by `(2 * i)` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined. After the function concludes, it returns a single value representing the sum of the cubes of the specified even numbers, leaving the input variable `n` unchanged.**
