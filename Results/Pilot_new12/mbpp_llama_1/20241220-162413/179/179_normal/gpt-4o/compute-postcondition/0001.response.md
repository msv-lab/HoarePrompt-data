The code calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n. 

`cube_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of cubes of the numbers in `even_numbers`. The numbers in `even_numbers` are even numbers from 2 to 2n, which is equivalent to `(2 * i)` for `i` in range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). 

So, `cube_sum` = `sum((2 * i) ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1))`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to 2n, where `even_numbers` = `[2, 4, 6,..., 2n]` or more specifically `even_numbers` = `[(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`, `cube_sum` is equal to `sum((2 * i) ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1))`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to 2n, `cube_sum` is equal to `sum((2 * i) ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1))`**
