Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The code correctly generates the sequence of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) using a list comprehension, cubes each number in the sequence, and returns the sum of these cubes.

The output hints provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, such as `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`. The function's implementation aligns with the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases that the code fails to handle, assuming that the input will always be a positive integer.

Given the assumptions about valid input and the lack of explicit error checking in the problem description, the code can be considered correct. It accurately computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers for all positive integer values of `n`.
