Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Generation of even numbers**: The code uses a list comprehension to generate the first `n` even natural numbers: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly generates the sequence of even numbers, starting from 2 and ending at `2n`.

2. **Cube sum calculation**: The code then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function: `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`. This correctly raises each even number to the power of 3 and sums up the results.

3. **Correctness for given assertions**: The provided assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800`) all pass with the given implementation, which suggests that the function behaves as expected for these specific inputs.

4. **General correctness**: Without any specific counterexamples or edge cases where the code fails to meet the problem description, it's reasonable to conclude that the function works correctly for all positive integer inputs `n`. The implementation directly follows from the mathematical definition of the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, leaving little room for logical errors given the straightforward nature of the computation.

Since I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the code is considered correct.
