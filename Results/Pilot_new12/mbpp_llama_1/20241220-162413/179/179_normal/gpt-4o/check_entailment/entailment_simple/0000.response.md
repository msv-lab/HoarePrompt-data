Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, and the program does exactly that.

Here is why the program always does what the problem description says:

- The list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` correctly generates the first n even natural numbers, which are 2, 4, 6,..., 2n.
- The `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` line calculates the sum of the cubes of each number in the `even_numbers` list.
- The function then returns this sum, which is the desired result according to the problem description.
- The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 72` and `assert func_1(3) == 288`, demonstrate that the function works as expected for different inputs.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
