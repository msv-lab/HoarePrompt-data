Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description asks for the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The code provided calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n, not the first n even natural numbers. For example, when n = 3, the first 3 even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6, but the code calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 6 (2, 4, 6). This is not the same as the sum of cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers (2, 4, 6), which is what the problem description asks for. 

The code should calculate the sum of cubes of the sequence 2, 4, 6,..., 2n, where n is the number of terms, not the upper limit. 

However, if we analyze the unit tests provided with the code, they seem to match the code's behavior. For example, when n = 2, the code calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 4 (2, 4), which is 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72, and this is the expected output according to the unit test `assert func_1(2) == 72`. 

But still the code does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers, which are 2, 4, 6,..., 2n. The last even number in the sum should be 2n, not 2n (where n is the upper limit in the range, not the number of terms). 

So the code does not match the problem description, it matches a different problem, which is to calculate the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n. 

This can easily be fixed by changing the range in the list comprehension to generate even numbers from 2 to 2n, where n is the number of terms, and the last even number in the sequence should be 2n. 

The corrected code should be:
```python
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```
But this code still uses the range up to n, so if we want to get the first n even natural numbers, where the last even number is 2n, we can generate the sequence of even numbers up to 2n and then take the first n numbers:
```python
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, 2*n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers[:n]))
    return cube_sum
```
