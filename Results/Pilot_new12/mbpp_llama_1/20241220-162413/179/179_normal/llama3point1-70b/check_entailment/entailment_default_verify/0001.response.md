The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers and concludes that it is correct. Upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is accurate.

The code correctly implements the calculation of the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. It uses a generator expression to generate the cubes of even numbers from 2 up to `2n` (inclusive) and then sums them up using the `sum()` function.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), which aligns with the problem description. The hints also mention that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but since we assume that the input will always be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The original assessment provides a thorough verification of the function's behavior, including edge cases, and concludes that the function is correct. The assessment also notes that the function handles `n = 0` and negative `n` in a manner that is consistent with the mathematical definition, although these cases are not explicitly covered by the problem statement.

Based on the output hints, the program, and the original assessment, I believe that the program is correct. The output hints provide additional context and confirm that the function behaves as expected, but they do not reveal any issues that would contradict the original assessment.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
