Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), cubes each integer using the exponentiation operator `**`, and sums up the results using the built-in `sum` function.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function performs a single action, which is to calculate and return the sum of cubes of even integers within the specified range.

To verify the correctness of the code, we can analyze its behavior for different values of `n`. For example, when `n` is 1, the function should return the cube of 2, which is 8. When `n` is 2, the function should return the sum of cubes of 2 and 4, which is 8 + 64 = 72.

The code handles these cases correctly and does not contain any obvious errors. Additionally, the output hints do not mention any specific cases where the function may not work as expected.

Since we assume that the input will be a positive integer and the function does not have any apparent issues, we can conclude that the code is correct.

For example, if we call `func_1(1)`, the function will return `2 ** 3 = 8`, which is the cube of the first even natural number. If we call `func_1(2)`, the function will return `2 ** 3 + 4 ** 3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which is the sum of cubes of the first two even natural numbers. This behavior aligns with the problem description, so we can conclude that the code is correct.
