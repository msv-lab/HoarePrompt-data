Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. To assess its correctness, we need to understand how it works and verify if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

1. **Understanding the Code**: The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers from 2 up to `n * 2` (inclusive), since `range()` is exclusive of the end value. The `sum()` function then adds up these cubes.

2. **Verification**:
   - **Even Numbers Generation**: The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` part correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n = 3`, it generates 2, 4, and 6, which are the first three even natural numbers.
   - **Cube Calculation**: The expression `i ** 3` correctly calculates the cube of each even number generated.
   - **Summation**: The `sum()` function correctly sums up these cubes.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Zero Input**: If `n = 0`, the function should technically return 0, as there are no even numbers to sum. The function behaves correctly in this case because `sum()` of an empty iterable returns 0, and `range(2, 0 * 2 + 1, 2)` produces an empty range.
   - **Negative Input**: Although the problem statement doesn't explicitly cover negative inputs, the function will return 0 for any negative `n` because `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` will be empty for any negative `n`, leading `sum()` to return 0. However, the mathematical concept of "first n even natural numbers" doesn't apply to negative `n`, so this case is more about the function's behavior under unexpected inputs rather than a correctness issue per se.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the function's implementation and the verification of its behavior for various inputs, including edge cases, it appears to correctly calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers for all positive integers `n`, and it handles `n = 0` and negative `n` in a manner that is consistent with the mathematical definition, albeit the latter is more about the function's robustness to invalid inputs.

Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
