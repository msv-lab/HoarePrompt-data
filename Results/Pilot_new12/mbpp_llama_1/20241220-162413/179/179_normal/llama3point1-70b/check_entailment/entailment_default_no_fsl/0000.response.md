Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive). 

The function uses a generator expression to efficiently calculate the sum of cubes of even integers within the specified range. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 2 to `2n` with a step of 2, ensuring that only even integers are included in the calculation.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can rely on the function receiving a positive integer `n`. Under this assumption, the function is correct and will produce the expected output for every potential case. 

The output hints provided confirm that the function performs as expected, returning the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) without modifying the input `n`. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description for all valid inputs, and therefore its correctness is confirmed.
