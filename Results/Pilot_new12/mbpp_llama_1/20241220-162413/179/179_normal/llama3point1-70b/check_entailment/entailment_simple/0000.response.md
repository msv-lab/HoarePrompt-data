Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's why it works:

- It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of cubes.
- The `range` function generates even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) by starting at 2, ending at `n * 2 + 1` (to include `2n`), and stepping by 2.
- For each even number `i` in this range, `i ** 3` calculates the cube of `i`, and `sum` adds up these cubes.

Since the function does exactly what the problem description asks for, given that `n` is a positive integer, it is correct. The problem description asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, and the function delivers this by summing the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n`, which are the first `n` even natural numbers. 

For example, if `n = 3`, the function calculates the sum of cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2, 4, and 6. This is done by calculating `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3`, which is exactly what the problem description requires.
