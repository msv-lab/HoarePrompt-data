You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to 2n (inclusive), where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive). The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it assumes that the input `n` will always be a positive integer. The function performs a single action, which is to calculate and return the sum of cubes of even integers within the specified range. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has returned the calculated sum, and any modifications to the input `n` are not preserved, as the function does not modify the input variable. The function's output is a single numeric value representing the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
