Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

The function uses a generator expression to generate the numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) with a step of 2, which ensures that only even numbers are generated. It then calculates the cube of each number using the exponentiation operator (`**`) and sums up these cubes using the built-in `sum` function.

This approach correctly implements the problem description. For example, if `n = 3`, the function will calculate the sum of the cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3, which is 8 + 64 + 216 = 288.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge case where `n = 0`, in which case it returns 0 (since the range will be empty and the sum of an empty range is 0). 

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and works as expected for all inputs.
