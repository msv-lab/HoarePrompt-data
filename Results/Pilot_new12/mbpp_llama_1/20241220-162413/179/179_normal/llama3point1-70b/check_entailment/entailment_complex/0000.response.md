Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

The provided function, `func_1(n)`, uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to 2n (inclusive), where n is a positive integer. This matches the requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Range of numbers**: The function generates even integers from 2 to 2n (inclusive) using `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which covers the first n even natural numbers.
2. **Calculation of cube sum**: The function calculates the cube of each even integer using `i ** 3` and sums them up using the `sum` function.
3. **Assumption of valid input**: As mentioned in the problem description, we assume that the input `n` will always be a positive integer, so the function does not need to handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer.

Since the function correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
