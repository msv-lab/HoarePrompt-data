The original assessment states that the program is correct, and based on the problem description and the provided code, this assessment makes sense. The code defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, which matches the problem description. The function uses a generator expression to generate even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) and calculates the sum of their cubes using the built-in `sum` function.

The output hints support the correctness of the program by describing its functionality accurately. They state that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), which aligns with the code's implementation. The hints also note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but this is not a requirement based on the problem description, which assumes valid input.

Given that the program accurately implements the problem description, handles the specified input correctly, and the output hints support its functionality, the original assessment of correctness is justified.

Final: **True**
