The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive). The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it assumes that the input `n` will always be a positive integer. The function performs a single action, which is to calculate and return the sum of cubes of even integers within the specified range. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has returned the calculated sum, and any modifications to the input `n` are not preserved, as the function does not modify the input variable. The function's output is a single numeric value representing the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n`.
