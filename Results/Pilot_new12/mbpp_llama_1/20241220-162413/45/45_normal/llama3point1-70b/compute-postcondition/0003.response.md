Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is True, `i` is 1. The current value of `n` at index `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` satisfies the condition that either `n[i - 1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i + 1]`, or `n[i - 1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i + 1]`.**
