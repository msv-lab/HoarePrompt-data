The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `n` has a length of less than 3 or if its digits (excluding the first and last) form an "undulating" sequence. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` if the string representation of `n` is shorter than 3 characters or its middle digits form an undulating sequence, and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns True if the string representation of n has a length of less than 3 or its middle digits form an undulating sequence, False otherwise.**
