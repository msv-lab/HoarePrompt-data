Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 2. If the digit at index `i-1` is less than the digit at index `i` and the digit at index `i` is less than the digit at index `i+1`, or if the digit at index `i-1` is greater than the digit at index `i` and the digit at index `i` is greater than the digit at index `i+1`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `undulating` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
