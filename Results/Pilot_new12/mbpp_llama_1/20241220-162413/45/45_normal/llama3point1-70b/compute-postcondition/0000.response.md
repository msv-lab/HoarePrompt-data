The code `n = str(n)` converts the integer value of `n` into a string. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer. 

After executing this code, the value of `n` is updated to be a string representation of its original integer value. 

The state of `n` being a positive integer is no longer valid because it has been converted into a string. However, the information that `n` originally held a positive integer value is still relevant for understanding its current string representation.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer**
