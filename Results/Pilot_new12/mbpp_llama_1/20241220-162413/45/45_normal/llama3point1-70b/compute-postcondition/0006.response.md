The code sets `undulating` to `False`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and the condition that it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is False, `i` is 1, and it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`).**
