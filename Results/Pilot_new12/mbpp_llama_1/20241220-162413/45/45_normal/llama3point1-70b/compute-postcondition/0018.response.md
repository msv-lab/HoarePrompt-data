Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 3. If the digits at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in `n` are either in increasing or decreasing order, then the state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `undulating` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
