Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 1, and either `undulating` is True if the condition that either `n[i - 1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i + 1]`, or `n[i - 1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i + 1]` is satisfied, or `undulating` is False if this condition is not met, at which point the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
