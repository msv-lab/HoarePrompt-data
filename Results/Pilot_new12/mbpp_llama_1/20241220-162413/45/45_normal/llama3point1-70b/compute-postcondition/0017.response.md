The `break` statement ends the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `undulating` remain unchanged. The only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 3, `undulating` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
