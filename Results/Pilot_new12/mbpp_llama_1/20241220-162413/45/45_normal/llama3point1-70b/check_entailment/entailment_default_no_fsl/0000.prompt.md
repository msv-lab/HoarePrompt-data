You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating


```
Output hints: The function determines whether the string representation of a given positive integer has a length of less than 3 or its middle digits form an undulating sequence, where such a sequence alternates between digits being greater and less than their immediate neighbors, and returns a boolean value accordingly. It accepts a positive integer as input, converts it to a string, and checks each middle digit (excluding the first and last) to see if it is part of an undulating sequence. If all middle digits are in an undulating sequence or the string has less than 3 digits, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function covers all potential cases and edge cases, including single-digit and two-digit numbers, and handles them correctly by returning True for numbers with less than 3 digits.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
