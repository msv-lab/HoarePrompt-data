Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it only checks if the middle digits of the number form an "undulating" sequence, where each digit (excluding the first and last) is either greater than its immediate neighbors or less than them. However, this is not the correct definition of an undulating number.

An undulating number should have its digits alternate between being greater than and less than their immediate neighbors. For example, 121 is an undulating number because the digits alternate between decreasing (1 to 2) and increasing (2 to 1). However, the given program would return False for this number because it checks if each digit (excluding the first and last) is both greater than and less than its immediate neighbors, which is impossible.

A correct implementation of the program should check if each digit (excluding the first) is either greater than or less than the previous digit, and if this relationship alternates throughout the number. The given program does not do this, so it does not meet the problem description. 

For instance, the number 214121 is undulating because it alternates between increasing and decreasing digits. However, the program would incorrectly return False for this number because it does not correctly implement the definition of an undulating number. 

Here's an example of how the program could be corrected:
```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return True
    increasing = None
    for i in range(len(n) - 1):
        if n[i] < n[i + 1]:
            if increasing is False:
                return False
            increasing = True
        elif n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            if increasing is True:
                return False
            increasing = False
        else:
            return False
    return True
```
