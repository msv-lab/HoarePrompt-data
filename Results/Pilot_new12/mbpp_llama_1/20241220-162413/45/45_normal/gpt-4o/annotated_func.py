    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, and `second_digit` equals the second character of `s`. Additionally, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:

        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` where every even index (starting from index 2) is equal to the first character of `s` (`first_digit`), and every odd index (starting from index 3) is equal to the second character of `s` (`second_digit`), with `first_digit` not equal to `second_digit`, or the function returns False if this pattern is not followed.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string representation of `n` follows the pattern where every even index (starting from index 2) is equal to the first character of `s` (`first_digit`), and every odd index (starting from index 3) is equal to the second character of `s` (`second_digit`), with `first_digit` not equal to `second_digit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input, converts it into a string `s`, and checks if the string representation follows a specific pattern. The pattern requires that the string must have a length of at least 3, the first and second digits must be different, and every even index (starting from index 2) must be equal to the first digit, while every odd index (starting from index 3) must be equal to the second digit. If the string representation of `n` meets this pattern, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes handling edge cases such as when the input integer `n` has a string representation less than 3 characters long, or when the first and second digits are the same, in which cases the function immediately returns `False`. The function does not modify the input integer `n` but rather analyzes its string representation to determine the output.
