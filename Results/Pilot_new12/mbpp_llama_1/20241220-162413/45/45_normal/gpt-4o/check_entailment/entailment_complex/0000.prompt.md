You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, and `second_digit` equals the second character of `s`. Additionally, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` where every even index (starting from index 2) is equal to the first character of `s` (`first_digit`), and every odd index (starting from index 3) is equal to the second character of `s` (`second_digit`), with `first_digit` not equal to `second_digit`, or the function returns False if this pattern is not followed.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string representation of `n` follows the pattern where every even index (starting from index 2) is equal to the first character of `s` (`first_digit`), and every odd index (starting from index 3) is equal to the second character of `s` (`second_digit`), with `first_digit` not equal to `second_digit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input, converts it into a string `s`, and checks if the string representation follows a specific pattern. The pattern requires that the string must have a length of at least 3, the first and second digits must be different, and every even index (starting from index 2) must be equal to the first digit, while every odd index (starting from index 3) must be equal to the second digit. If the string representation of `n` meets this pattern, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes handling edge cases such as when the input integer `n` has a string representation less than 3 characters long, or when the first and second digits are the same, in which cases the function immediately returns `False`. The function does not modify the input integer `n` but rather analyzes its string representation to determine the output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
