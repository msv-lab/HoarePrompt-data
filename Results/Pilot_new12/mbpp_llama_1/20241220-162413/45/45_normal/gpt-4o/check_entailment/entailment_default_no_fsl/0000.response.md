Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined by the pattern where every even index (starting from index 2, with 0-based indexing) must be equal to the first digit, and every odd index (starting from index 3) must be equal to the second digit, with the additional conditions that the string representation must have a length of at least 3 and the first and second digits must be different.

Upon examining the provided code and its logic, it appears to accurately implement these conditions. 

1. It first checks if the length of the string representation of the number is less than 3, returning `False` if so, because an undulating number by the given definition must have at least 3 digits.

2. It then checks if the first and second digits are the same, returning `False` in this case, because the definition of an undulating number, as implemented, requires these digits to be different.

3. Finally, it iterates through the string from index 2 to the end, checking that every even index has the first digit and every odd index has the second digit, returning `False` if it finds any index not matching these conditions.

The output hints and the provided unit tests (e.g., `assert func_1(1212121) == True`, `assert func_1(1991) == False`, `assert func_1(121) == True`) support the correctness of the function's implementation, given the specific definition of an "undulating" number used here.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the function correctly identifies undulating numbers according to the specified pattern and rejects numbers that do not match this pattern. The function's logic is sound and covers all the potential cases described in the problem statement, including edge cases like numbers with less than 3 digits or with the first and second digits being the same. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and the specific definition of "undulating" used, the function is correct.
