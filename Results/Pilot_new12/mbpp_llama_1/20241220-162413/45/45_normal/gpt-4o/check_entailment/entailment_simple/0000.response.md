Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the problem description of checking whether a given number is undulating or not. 

An undulating number is a number where every even index (starting from index 2) is equal to the first character of the string representation of the number, and every odd index (starting from index 3) is equal to the second character of the string representation of the number, with the first and second characters being different.

The program correctly checks for the following conditions:
1. The number should have at least 3 digits.
2. The first two digits should not be the same.
3. Every even index (starting from index 2) should have the same digit as the first digit.
4. Every odd index (starting from index 3) should have the same digit as the second digit.

If all these conditions are met, the program returns True, indicating that the number is undulating. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The program handles all potential cases as per the problem description, and the provided unit tests also verify its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
