Correctness: **True**

The code provided in `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is one where the digits alternate between two specific digits. The function accepts an integer `n`, converts it into a string `s`, and then checks for this alternating pattern.

The pattern requires that the string representation of `n` must have a length of at least 3, and the first and second digits must be different. Then, every even index (starting from index 2) must be equal to the first digit, and every odd index (starting from index 3) must be equal to the second digit.

The code correctly handles edge cases:
- It checks if the length of the string representation is less than 3 and returns `False` in such cases because an undulating number must have at least 3 digits.
- It also checks if the first and second digits are the same, returning `False` because the first two digits must be different for an undulating pattern.

The loop that checks the pattern is also correctly implemented:
- It iterates over the string from index 2 to the end.
- It checks if the current index is even (i % 2 == 0) and if the digit at this index is equal to the first digit. If not, it returns `False`.
- It checks if the current index is odd (i % 2 == 1) and if the digit at this index is equal to the second digit. If not, it returns `False`.

Given the provided assertions:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True`, which is correct because the number alternates between 1 and 2.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False`, which is correct because the number does not follow an undulating pattern.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True`, which is correct because the number alternates between 1 and 2.

The function works as expected according to the problem description, correctly identifying undulating numbers and handling edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case described.
