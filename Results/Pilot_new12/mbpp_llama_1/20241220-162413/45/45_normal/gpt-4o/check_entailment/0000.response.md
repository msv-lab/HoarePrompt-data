Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between two specific digits. For example, 1212121 is an undulating number because it alternates between 1 and 2.

The function first converts the number to a string, then checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `False` because an undulating number must have at least 3 digits.

The function then checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, the function returns `False` because an undulating number cannot start with two identical digits.

Finally, the function iterates through the rest of the string, checking if the digits at even indices are equal to the first digit and if the digits at odd indices are equal to the second digit. If it finds a digit that does not match this pattern, it returns `False`.

If the function finishes iterating through the string without finding any digits that do not match the pattern, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function is working correctly. For example, `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` and `func_1(1991)` returns `False`, which is consistent with the definition of an undulating number.

I was unable to find a case where the function does not work as expected, so I conclude that the function is correct.
