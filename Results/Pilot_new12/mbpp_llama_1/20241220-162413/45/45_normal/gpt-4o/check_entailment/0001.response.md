Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct as it checks whether a given number is undulating or not by converting the number into a string and then verifying that the digits at even indices are the same and the digits at odd indices are the same, starting from the first digit at index 0. 

The function starts by checking if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns False because an undulating number must have at least three digits. Then it checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, the function returns False because an undulating number must have different digits at the first two positions.

After these initial checks, the function enters a loop where it iterates over the string from the third character to the end. Inside the loop, it checks if the current digit is at an even index (0-based indexing). If it is, the function checks if the digit is the same as the first digit. If not, it returns False. If the current digit is at an odd index, the function checks if the digit is the same as the second digit. If not, it returns False.

If the function passes all these checks without returning False, it returns True, indicating that the number is undulating.

The unit tests provided in the problem description also support this conclusion. For example, the number 1212121 is correctly identified as undulating, while the number 1991 is correctly identified as not undulating. The number 121 is also correctly identified as undulating, although this might be a simple case, it works as expected.

Since the program handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
