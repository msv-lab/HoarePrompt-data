To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `s` is the string representation of `n`.
- The length of `s` is more than or equal to 3.

Given Code:
```python
first_digit = s[0]
```

This line of code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_digit`. Since `s` is the string representation of the integer `n`, `s[0]` represents the first digit of `n` when `n` is viewed as a string.

The length of `s` being more than or equal to 3 implies that `n` is at least a 3-digit number (could be positive or negative, but since it's an integer and its string representation's length is at least 3, we focus on its digits). However, the sign of `n` (if negative) would be represented as a '-' character, which would be the first character of `s` in the case of a negative number. In such a scenario, `first_digit` would be '-'.

For positive `n`, `first_digit` would indeed be the first digit of the number `n`. 

Therefore, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, which could either be the first digit of `n` if `n` is positive or a '-' if `n` is negative.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3, and `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, which is either the first digit of `n` if `n` is non-negative or '-' if `n` is negative.**
