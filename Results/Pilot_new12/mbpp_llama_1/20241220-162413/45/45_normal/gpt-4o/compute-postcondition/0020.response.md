Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 4, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, `second_digit` equals the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `i` equals 3 and `s[i]` equals `second_digit`.***
