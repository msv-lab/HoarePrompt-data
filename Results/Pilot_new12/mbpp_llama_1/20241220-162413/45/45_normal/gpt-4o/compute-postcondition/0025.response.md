Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 5, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, `second_digit` equals the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4. If `i` is odd and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, if `i` is even and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to `first_digit`, the program returns False. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made.***
