Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` equals the first character of `s`, `second_digit` equals the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, and either initially `i` is not divisible by 2 or initially `s[i]` equals `first_digit`. The current value of `i` is odd (i % 2 == 1) and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`**
