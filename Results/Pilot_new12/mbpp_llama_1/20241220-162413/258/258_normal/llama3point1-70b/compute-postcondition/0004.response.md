The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. 

Since `digit` is the first character in `num_str`, which is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `int(digit)` is the integer value of the first digit of `num`. 

`num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, which is greater than or equal to 1.

So, `sum` becomes `sum + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`) ** (the number of digits in `num`).

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1 and represents the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is `sum + int(digit) ** num_len` where `digit` is the first character in `num_str` and `int(digit)` is the integer value of `digit`, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1 and represents the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is the initial `sum` + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`) ** (the number of digits in `num`), `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
