To determine the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the operation performed by the code.

Given:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string with at least 1 character.
- `num_len` is greater than 1.
- `sum` is the initial `sum` + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`) + (the integer value of the second digit of `num`).

Operation:
```python
sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```

To calculate the new `sum`, we need to consider the value of `digit`. However, the initial state does not explicitly define `digit`. Assuming `digit` is a variable that takes on a value (since it's not defined in the initial state, its value or how it's derived is unknown), the code will add the result of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len` to `sum`.

Given the initial state's constraints:
- The fact that `num` is a non-negative integer and `num_str` has at least 1 character implies that `num` and `num_str` could be related (e.g., `num_str` could be the string representation of `num`), but without explicit conversion or relation defined in the initial state, we treat them separately.
- `num_len` being greater than 1 implies that if `num_str` is indeed related to `num`, then `num` has at least two digits.

However, without more specific information about `digit`, we can only describe the operation's effect on `sum` in general terms:
- `sum` will increase by the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Therefore, the output state, considering all given information and the operation performed, is:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string with at least 1 character.
- `num_len` is greater than 1.
- `sum` is the initial `sum` + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`) + (the integer value of the second digit of `num`) + `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string with at least 1 character, `num_len` is greater than 1, `sum` is the result of the initial sum plus the first two digits of `num` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len`.**
