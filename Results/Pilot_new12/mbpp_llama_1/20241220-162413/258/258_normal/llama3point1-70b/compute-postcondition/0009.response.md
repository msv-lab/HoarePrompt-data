To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for digit in num_str:
    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```
The initial state is:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
- `sum` is 0.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `num` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
- `num_str` also remains unchanged because it's just a string representation of `num` and isn't modified within the loop.
- `num_len` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop since it represents the number of digits in `num`, and this doesn't change.
- `sum` is accumulated by raising each digit of `num` (converted to an integer) to the power of `num_len` and adding it to the current `sum`.

Given the loop iterates over each character (digit) in `num_str`, after all iterations have finished, `sum` will have accumulated the results of raising each digit in `num` to the power of `num_len`. Thus, `sum` will be the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`.

If `num_str` is empty (meaning `num` is 0), the loop will not execute, and `sum` will remain 0, which is consistent because the sum of no digits is 0, and `num_len` would be 0 for the number 0, but since 0^0 is a special case and often considered 1 in many mathematical contexts, but here it simply means the loop doesn't execute, so `sum` stays as initially defined, 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
- `num` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` (unchanged).
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num` (unchanged).
- `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the total number of digits in `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
