According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters. Since one character has already been processed, `num_str` now has at least 1 remaining character for the next iteration, but since we want to execute the loop one more time, it must have at least 2 characters initially and now it will have at least 1 character left to process, so `num_str` must have had at least 2 characters initially for the loop to execute one more time after the first iteration and now for the loop to execute again after the previous iteration, `num_str` must have at least 1 character left, but since we are at the end of the previous iteration, we are looking at the state for the next iteration to be possible, hence `num_str` must have initially had at least 3 characters and now has at least 2 characters for the next iteration to be possible, and `digit` is the next character in `num_str`. Also, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, so for `num_str` to have at least 3 characters initially, `num_len` must be greater than 2. The state of `sum` also depends on the previous iteration, it includes `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len`, so if we are at the end of the first iteration and `num_str` initially had at least 2 characters and hence `num_len` was at least 2 and `sum` was calculated based on this `num_len`, for the next iteration `num_len` must be the initial length minus one because one character has been processed, but we are looking at the next iteration where `num_len` must be such that it makes the next iteration possible, hence `num_len` initially was greater than 2 and is now greater than 1 because one character has been processed and we want the state that makes the next iteration possible.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string with at least 2 characters, `num_len` is greater than 1, `sum` is the result of the initial sum plus the first two digits of `num` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len` plus `int(next_digit)` to the power of `num_len` minus one**
