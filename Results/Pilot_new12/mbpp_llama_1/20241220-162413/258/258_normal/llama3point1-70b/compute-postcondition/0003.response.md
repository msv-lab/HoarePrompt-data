To execute the given for loop, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `num_str`. 

For the loop to execute, `num_str` must have at least one character, meaning it cannot be an empty string. Since `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, and `num` is a non-negative integer, the condition for `num_str` to have at least one character implies that `num` must also be greater than or equal to 0 but not exactly 0 if we consider the number of digits. However, since `num` is stated to be a non-negative integer and `num_str` is its string representation, the loop can indeed execute even if `num` is 0 because '0' is a single character.

Given that `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, for `num_str` to have at least one character (which is the case when `num` is 0 or any positive integer), `num_len` should be greater than or equal to 0, but more precisely, it should reflect the number of digits in `num_str`. If `num` is 0, `num_len` is 1 because '0' is one digit. If `num` is any other non-negative integer, `num_len` will be the actual count of digits in `num`.

At the start of the loop, since we're iterating over `num_str`, the variable `digit` will take the value of the first character in `num_str`. 

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1 and represents the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
