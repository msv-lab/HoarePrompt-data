According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` is a non-empty string, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, and `sum` is the initial `sum` + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters. Since one character has been processed in the previous iteration, the remaining string must have at least 1 character for the loop to execute again. 

The `num_len` must be greater than 1, since one digit has been processed. The `sum` must be updated to include the integer value of the second digit of `num`. The `num` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string with at least 1 character, `num_len` is greater than 1, `sum` is the initial `sum` + (the integer value of the first digit of `num`) + (the integer value of the second digit of `num`)**
