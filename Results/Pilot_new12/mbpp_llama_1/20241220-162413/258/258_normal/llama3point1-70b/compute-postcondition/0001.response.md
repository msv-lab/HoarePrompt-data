To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.

The code snippet is: `num_len = len(num_str)`

This line of code calculates the length of the string `num_str` and assigns it to `num_len`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, the length of `num_str` essentially represents the number of digits in `num`.

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer, the number of digits in `num` (or the length of `num_str`) can vary depending on the value of `num`. For example, if `num` is 0, `num_str` is '0' and `num_len` would be 1. If `num` is 123, `num_str` is '123' and `num_len` would be 3.

Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions for `num` and `num_str`, and the new variable `num_len` which is equal to the number of digits in `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`**
