The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` increments the value of `sum` by the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. 

Given the initial state, `sum` is the result of the initial sum plus the first two digits of `num` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len` plus `int(next_digit)` to the power of `num_len` minus one. After the execution of the code, `sum` becomes the result of the initial sum plus the first two digits of `num` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len` plus `int(next_digit)` to the power of `num_len` minus one plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string with at least 2 characters, `num_len` is greater than 1, `sum` is the result of the initial sum plus the first two digits of `num` plus 2 * `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len` plus `int(next_digit)` to the power of `num_len` minus one**
