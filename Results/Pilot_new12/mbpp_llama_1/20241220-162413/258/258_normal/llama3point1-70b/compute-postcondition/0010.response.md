To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state is as follows:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
- `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The Python code snippet is `return sum == num`. This means the program will return a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len` is equal to `num` itself.

Given the initial state and the code, we are comparing `sum` (the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`) with `num` (the original non-negative integer).

Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` is equal to `num` itself.**
