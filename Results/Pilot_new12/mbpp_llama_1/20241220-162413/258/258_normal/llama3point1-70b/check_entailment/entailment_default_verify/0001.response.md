Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

The function works as follows:
1. It converts the input number to a string to easily get the number of digits and iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. It checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number.

The output hints also suggest that the function handles edge cases correctly, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, and returns a boolean value as expected.

Upon examining the function and output hints, I did not find any indication that the function fails to meet the problem description. The function seems to correctly identify Armstrong numbers and returns the expected boolean values.

Therefore, I will maintain the original assessment. 

The reason I believe the original assessment is accurate is that the provided code correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases, including edge cases. 

Final: **True**
