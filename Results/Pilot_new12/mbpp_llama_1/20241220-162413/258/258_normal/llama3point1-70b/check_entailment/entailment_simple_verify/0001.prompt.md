You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:

1. It converts the input number to a string to easily get the number of digits and iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. It checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number.

The function correctly handles all potential cases:

- Single-digit numbers: Since any single-digit number raised to the power of 1 is itself, the function correctly identifies single-digit numbers as Armstrong numbers.
- Multi-digit numbers: The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if it's equal to the original number.
- Edge cases: The function handles edge cases such as 0 (which is not an Armstrong number) and negative numbers (which are not considered Armstrong numbers, but the function will still work correctly for them).

After reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` is equal to `num` itself.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
