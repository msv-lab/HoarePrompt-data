You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It converts the input number to a string `num_str` to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string `num_len`, which represents the number of digits in the input number.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits each raised to the power of `num_len`.
4. It iterates over each digit in `num_str`, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds the result to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if `sum` is equal to the original input number `num` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.

This logic correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number, and the code handles all potential cases without exception. For example, it correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153, and it correctly identifies 12 as not an Armstrong number because 1^2 + 2^2 = 5, which is not equal to 12. 

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `num` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` equals `num`. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `num` is 0 (in which case it returns True because 0^1 = 0) and when `num` is a single-digit number (where it correctly calculates the power). The function also correctly handles multi-digit numbers by iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of the total number of digits, and summing these values for comparison with the original number. Note that the input `num` itself remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function, as the function only operates on its string representation and calculated values. The return value is a boolean (True or False) based on whether the calculated sum equals the original input `num`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
