Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

In the given program, the function `func_1` first converts the input number `num` into a string `num_str` to easily calculate the length of the number (`num_len`). 

Then, it initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number. For each digit, it calculates the digit raised to the power of `num_len` and adds it to the `sum`. 

Finally, it checks if the calculated `sum` is equal to the original number `num` and returns `True` if they are equal (i.e., the number is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

For example, if the input number is 371, the program will calculate the sum as follows:

- 3^3 = 27
- 7^3 = 343
- 1^3 = 1
- Sum = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371

Since the sum (371) is equal to the original number (371), the program will return `True`, indicating that 371 is an Armstrong number.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number, as described in the problem statement.
