Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:

1. It converts the input number to a string to easily get the number of digits and iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. It checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number.

The function correctly handles all potential cases:

- Single-digit numbers: Since any single-digit number raised to the power of 1 is itself, the function correctly identifies single-digit numbers as Armstrong numbers.
- Multi-digit numbers: The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if it's equal to the original number.
- Edge cases: The function handles edge cases such as 0 (which is not an Armstrong number) and negative numbers (which are not considered Armstrong numbers, but the function will still work correctly for them).

After reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
