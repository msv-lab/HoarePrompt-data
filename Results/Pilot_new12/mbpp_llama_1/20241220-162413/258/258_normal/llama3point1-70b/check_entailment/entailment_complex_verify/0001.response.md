The original assessment correctly determines the program's correctness as **True**. The provided Python program accurately implements the functionality to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by detailing the state of the program at different points and explaining how the function handles various cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases like 0. The annotations confirm that the function correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if it's equal to the original number.

The original assessment and the annotated code align with the problem description, which defines an Armstrong number as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The program correctly handles all potential cases, and the annotations validate its correctness by outlining the program's behavior step by step.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
