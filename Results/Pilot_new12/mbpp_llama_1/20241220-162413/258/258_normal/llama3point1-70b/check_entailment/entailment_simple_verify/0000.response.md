Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The provided code correctly implements this logic:

1. It converts the input number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string, which represents the number of digits in the input number.
3. It initializes a variable to store the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. It iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to the sum.
5. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original input number and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is an Armstrong number.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it correctly describes the state of the program at different points:

- Before the function call, `num` is a non-negative integer.
- After the `for` loop, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
- The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` is equal to `num` itself.

The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The original assessment is accurate because the code correctly handles all potential cases without exception, as demonstrated by the examples provided in the original assessment (e.g., 153 is correctly identified as an Armstrong number, and 12 is correctly identified as not an Armstrong number).

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
