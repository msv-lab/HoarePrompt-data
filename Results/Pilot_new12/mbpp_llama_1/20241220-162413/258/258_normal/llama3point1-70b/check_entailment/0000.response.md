Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It converts the input number to a string `num_str` to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string `num_len`, which represents the number of digits in the input number.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits each raised to the power of `num_len`.
4. It iterates over each digit in `num_str`, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds the result to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if `sum` is equal to the original input number `num` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.

This logic correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number, and the code handles all potential cases without exception. For example, it correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153, and it correctly identifies 12 as not an Armstrong number because 1^2 + 2^2 = 5, which is not equal to 12. 

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all inputs.
