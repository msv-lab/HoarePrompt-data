To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the variables and their relationships as given in the initial state:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.
- `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The code `return armstrong_sum == n` checks if the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` is equal to `n` itself.

Given the initial state, `armstrong_sum` is calculated as `sum(int(digit)**num_len for digit in num_str)`, which means each digit in the string representation of `n` is converted to an integer, raised to the power of the total number of digits in `n`, and then summed together.

The program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether `armstrong_sum` is equal to `n`. 

This essentially checks if `n` is an Armstrong number, which is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Output State: **The program returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number (i.e., `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`), and False otherwise.**
