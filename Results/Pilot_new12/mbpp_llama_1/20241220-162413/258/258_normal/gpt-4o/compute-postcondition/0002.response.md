To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided Python code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`

Given Code: 
```python
armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
```

This code calculates the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, which is essentially calculating the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`. This is a step in determining if a number is an Armstrong number, but the code only calculates this sum and assigns it to `armstrong_sum`.

Impact on Variables:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` remains unchanged as it's the string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` remains unchanged as it's the number of digits in `n`.
- A new variable `armstrong_sum` is introduced, which is the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`.

Output State: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`
- `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of `num_len`, which can be expressed as `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, `armstrong_sum` is `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`**
