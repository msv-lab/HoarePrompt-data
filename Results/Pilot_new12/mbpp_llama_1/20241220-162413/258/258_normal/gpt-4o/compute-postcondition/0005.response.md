Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is an Armstrong number. The final state of the program after it concludes will be that the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns `True` if `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and `False` otherwise, including all potential edge cases such as when `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number. The function correctly handles these edge cases and returns the expected result. The function does not perform any side effects or modifications to external state, only returning a result based on the input `n`.**
