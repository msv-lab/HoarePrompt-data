Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's why the program works correctly:

- The program converts the input number to a string to easily get the number of digits and to iterate over each digit.
- It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, which is the definition of an Armstrong number.
- It then checks if this sum is equal to the original number. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns False.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program:

- `func_1(153)` returns True because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.
- `func_1(259)` returns False because 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862, which is not equal to 259.
- `func_1(4458)` is not a straightforward example, but it can be verified that it's not an Armstrong number since 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 5233, which is not equal to 4458.

Without finding any counterexample or case where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
