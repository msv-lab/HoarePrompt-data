To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand the problem description and the code itself. 

The problem description asks for a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is defined as a number that equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

Let's analyze the code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
```
Here's what the code does:

1. It converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str`.
2. It calculates the length of `num_str`, which represents the number of digits in `n`.
3. It calculates the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`.
4. It checks if this sum equals the original number `n` and returns `True` if they are equal (i.e., `n` is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

Based on this analysis, the code correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number. For any non-negative integer input `n`, it correctly calculates whether `n` is an Armstrong number or not according to the definition provided.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for every potential case, assuming that the input will be a valid non-negative integer.

Correctness: **True**
