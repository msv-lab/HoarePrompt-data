The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as expected, correctly checking whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is an Armstrong number. It correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, which is the definition of an Armstrong number. 

The function handles potential edge cases such as when `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number, and returns the expected result. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program.

The annotations in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected, and the final state of the program after it concludes is as expected.

Therefore, the original assessment of **True** for the correctness of the program remains accurate.

Final: **True**
