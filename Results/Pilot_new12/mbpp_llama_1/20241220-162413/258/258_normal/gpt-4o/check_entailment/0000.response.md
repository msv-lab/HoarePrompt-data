Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(n)` checks whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:

1. It converts the number into a string to easily calculate the number of digits.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. It checks if the sum is equal to the original number.

The function handles all cases correctly:

- It handles single-digit numbers: for example, `func_1(5)` returns `True` because 5^1 = 5.
- It handles multi-digit numbers: for example, `func_1(153)` returns `True` because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.
- It handles numbers that are not Armstrong numbers: for example, `func_1(259)` returns `False` because 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862, which is not equal to 259.

There are no cases where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
