Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number or not. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
- It converts `n` into a string `num_str` to easily calculate its length `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`.
- It calculates the sum `armstrong_sum` of each digit in `n` raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
- It returns `True` if `n` equals `armstrong_sum`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.
- The function handles all potential edge cases correctly, including when `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number, because the calculation `armstrong_sum` works correctly in these cases.
- The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples, including both Armstrong numbers (e.g., 153) and non-Armstrong numbers (e.g., 259 and 4458).

In summary, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers for all non-negative integer inputs.
