Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a correct implementation of the function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. The code correctly handles this logic and returns `True` if the number is an Armstrong number and `False` otherwise.

The code uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, which is efficient and clear. It also correctly handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers.

The output hints suggest that the function correctly handles potential edge cases such as when the input `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number. Additionally, the unit tests provided in the code also support the correctness of the function.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a non-negative integer. Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, the function appears to be correct for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **True**.
