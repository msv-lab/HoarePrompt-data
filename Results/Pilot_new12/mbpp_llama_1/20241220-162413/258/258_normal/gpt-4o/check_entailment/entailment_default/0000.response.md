Correctness: **True**

The given code checks whether a number is an Armstrong number, which is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function `func_1` first converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` and calculates the number of digits `num_len`. It then calculates the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression and the built-in `sum` function.

The code correctly handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number. 

For example, when `n` is 0, `num_str` will be '0', `num_len` will be 1, and `armstrong_sum` will be 0^1 = 0, which is equal to `n`, so the function correctly returns `True`.

When `n` is a single-digit number, say 5, `num_str` will be '5', `num_len` will be 1, and `armstrong_sum` will be 5^1 = 5, which is equal to `n`, so the function correctly returns `True`.

When `n` is a multi-digit number, say 153, `num_str` will be '153', `num_len` will be 3, and `armstrong_sum` will be 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153, which is equal to `n`, so the function correctly returns `True`.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function correctly handles all potential edge cases and returns the expected result. 

Therefore, the code is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
