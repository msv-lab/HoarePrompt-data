#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number (i.e., `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`), and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is an Armstrong number. The final state of the program after it concludes will be that the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns `True` if `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and `False` otherwise, including all potential edge cases such as when `n` is 0, a single-digit number, or a multi-digit number. The function correctly handles these edge cases and returns the expected result. The function does not perform any side effects or modifications to external state, only returning a result based on the input `n`.
