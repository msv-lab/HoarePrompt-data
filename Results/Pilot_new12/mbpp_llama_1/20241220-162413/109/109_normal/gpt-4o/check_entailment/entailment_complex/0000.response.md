Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input and returns a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced with the elements of `list2`.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `list1[:-1]`: This expression returns a slice of `list1` containing all elements except the last one.
2. `+ list2`: This concatenates the sliced `list1` with `list2`, effectively replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
3. The function returns the resulting concatenated list.

The problem description requires the function to:

* Take two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input.
* Replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
* Return the resulting list.

The provided function meets these requirements. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios.

Note that the problem description assumes valid input, so we don't need to consider cases where `list1` or `list2` might be empty or not lists. Under the assumption of valid input, the function correctly implements the required behavior.
