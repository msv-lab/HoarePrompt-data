Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. 

Here's why it works:
- `list1[:-1]` returns a slice of `list1` that includes all elements except the last one.
- `list2` is concatenated with the slice of `list1` using the `+` operator, effectively replacing the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected. 

For example, in the first test case, `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is the result of replacing the last element `10` of the first list with the elements of the second list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.

The same logic applies to the other test cases, demonstrating that the function correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description.
