Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced with the elements of `list2`. The function uses list slicing (`list1[:-1]`) to exclude the last element of `list1` and then concatenates the result with `list2` using the `+` operator.

The output hints and the provided unit tests confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function does not modify the original lists, and it correctly handles cases where `list2` is empty. The function always removes the last element from `list1` before concatenating with `list2`, regardless of the contents or size of `list2`.

The function description and the output hints agree with the code, and the provided unit tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list.

In every potential case, the function will correctly replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2` and return a new list without modifying the original lists. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
