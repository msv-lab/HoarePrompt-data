#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists, and list1 is not empty.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
    #The program returns a list containing all elements from `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements from `list2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists and `list1` is not empty, and returns a new list containing all elements from `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements from `list2`. The function does not modify the original lists. If `list2` is empty, the function will return all elements from `list1` except the last one. The function will always remove the last element from `list1` before concatenating with `list2`, regardless of the contents or size of `list2`. The final state of the program will be the return of this new concatenated list, leaving the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`) unchanged.
