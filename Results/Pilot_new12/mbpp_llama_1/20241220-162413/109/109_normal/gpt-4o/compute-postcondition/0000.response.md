To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code `return list1[:-1] + list2` is returning a new list that consists of all elements from `list1` except the last one (`list1[:-1]`) concatenated with all elements from `list2`.

Given that `list1` is not empty and both `list1` and `list2` are lists, the operation `list1[:-1]` will return a slice of `list1` that includes all elements up to but not including the last element. This slice is then concatenated with `list2` using the `+` operator.

Since we don't have specific information about the contents or lengths of `list1` and `list2`, we can only describe the result in general terms:

- The returned list will contain all elements from `list1` except its last element.
- It will also contain all elements from `list2`.
- The order of elements will be preserved, with elements from `list1` (excluding the last one) coming first, followed by elements from `list2`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns a list containing all elements from `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements from `list2`.**
