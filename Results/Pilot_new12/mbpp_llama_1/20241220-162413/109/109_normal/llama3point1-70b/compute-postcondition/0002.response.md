To solve this task, we first need to understand the given precondition and the if condition, and then formulate the postcondition based on the negation of the if condition while retaining all conditions stated in the precondition.

Given Precondition: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `list1` is not empty.
Given If condition: `if (list1):`

The if condition `if (list1):` in Python checks if `list1` is truthy. A list in Python is considered truthy if it is not empty and falsy if it is empty. Therefore, the condition `if (list1):` is essentially checking if `list1` is not empty.

To negate this condition, we consider the scenario where `list1` is empty, because that's when the if condition would be false, leading the program to enter the else block.

Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `list1` is empty.**
