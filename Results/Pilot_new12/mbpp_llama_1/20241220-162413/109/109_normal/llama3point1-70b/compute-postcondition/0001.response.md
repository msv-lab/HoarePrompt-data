The given code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. 

Since `list1` is not empty, it has at least one element. The last element of `list1` is replaced with all elements of `list2`. This means the last element of `list1` is removed and all elements of `list2` are appended at the end of `list1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is not empty and is equal to its original value except for the last element which is replaced with the elements of `list2`, `list2` remains unchanged. We can express `list1` as `list1[:-1] + list2` where `list1[:-1]` represents all elements of `list1` except the last one.

Output State: **`list1` is `list1[:-1] + list2`, `list2` remains unchanged**
