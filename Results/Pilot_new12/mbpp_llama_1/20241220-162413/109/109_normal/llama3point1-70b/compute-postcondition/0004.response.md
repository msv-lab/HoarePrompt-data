Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists. Since `list1` is not empty as per the precondition, the if condition `if list1` will always be true. Therefore, `list1` will be modified to `list1[:-1] + list2` and `list2` remains unchanged. The else part will not be executed because `list1` is not empty.***
