#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists, list1 is not empty.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists. Since `list1` is not empty as per the precondition, the if condition `if list1` will always be true. Therefore, `list1` will be modified to `list1[:-1] + list2` and `list2` remains unchanged. The else part will not be executed because `list1` is not empty.
    return list1
    #The program returns a list that is a combination of all elements from the original `list1` except the last one, plus all elements from `list2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists. It returns a combined list where `list1`'s last element is replaced with all elements from `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it returns `list2`. The function modifies the original `list1` if it is not empty. The return value is a list combining all elements from the original `list1` except the last one, plus all elements from `list2` if `list1` is not empty; otherwise, it returns `list2`.
