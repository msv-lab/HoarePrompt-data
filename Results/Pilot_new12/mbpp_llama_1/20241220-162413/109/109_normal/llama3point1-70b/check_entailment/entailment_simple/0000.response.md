## Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

- The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input.
- The condition `if list1` checks if `list1` is not empty. Since the problem description states that `list1` is not empty, this condition will always be true.
- Inside the if block, the statement `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.
- The else block is not executed because `list1` is not empty, as per the precondition.
- The function returns the modified `list1`, which now contains all elements from the original `list1` except the last one, plus all elements from `list2`.

The program always does what the problem description says because it correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2` and returns the modified list.

Example usage:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5]
print(func_1(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
