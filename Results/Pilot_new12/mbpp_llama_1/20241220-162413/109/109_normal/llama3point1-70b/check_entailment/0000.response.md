Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when the first list is empty. According to the problem description, when the first list is empty, the function should return the second list. However, in the given program, when the first list is empty, the line `list1 = list2` is executed, but this change does not affect the return value of the function because `list1` is passed by object reference, and the new assignment does not modify the original list. The return statement `return list1` still returns the original empty list.

To fix this issue, the function should return `list2` directly when `list1` is empty, instead of reassigning `list1` to `list2`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        return list2  # Return list2 directly when list1 is empty
    return list1
```

Alternatively, the function can also be simplified as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1 if list1 else list2
```
