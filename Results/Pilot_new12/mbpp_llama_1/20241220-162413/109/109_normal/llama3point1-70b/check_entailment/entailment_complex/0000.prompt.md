You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists, list1 is not empty.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists. Since `list1` is not empty as per the precondition, the if condition `if list1` will always be true. Therefore, `list1` will be modified to `list1[:-1] + list2` and `list2` remains unchanged. The else part will not be executed because `list1` is not empty.
    return list1
    #The program returns a list that is a combination of all elements from the original `list1` except the last one, plus all elements from `list2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists. It returns a combined list where `list1`'s last element is replaced with all elements from `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it returns `list2`. The function modifies the original `list1` if it is not empty. The return value is a list combining all elements from the original `list1` except the last one, plus all elements from `list2` if `list1` is not empty; otherwise, it returns `list2`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
