Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, `list1` and `list2`. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it simply returns `list2`.

The key line of code that achieves this is `list1[-1:] = list2`, which replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. This works as expected because Python's slice assignment allows assigning multiple values to a slice.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is the expected result. If `list1` is empty, the function will return `list2`, as expected.

The output hints provided agree with the code and describe the expected behavior accurately. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
