The function `flip` reverses the order of elements in the list `arr` from the start (index 0) to the specified `end` index. It modifies the original list in-place and does not return any value. After execution, the elements in `arr` between indices 0 and the original value of `end` are reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The function handles cases where `end` is 0 or greater, up to but not including the length of `arr`, and does not explicitly handle cases where `end` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr` or less than 0, as these are assumed to be invalid inputs based on the provided annotations. If `arr` has one or zero elements, or if `end` is 0, the function does not alter the list, effectively acting as an identity function for these edge cases. The function's effect is solely on the input list `arr`, and it does not produce a new list or value as output.
