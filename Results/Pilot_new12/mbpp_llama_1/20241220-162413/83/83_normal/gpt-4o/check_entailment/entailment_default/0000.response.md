Correctness: **False**

The code attempts to implement a sorting algorithm, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented. The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, but the code provided sorts the list in descending order instead of ascending order.

However, the main issue with the code is that it does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm. The function `func_1` uses a modified version of the pancake sort algorithm, which is not suitable for sorting a list of elements in ascending order. The algorithm used in `func_1` is designed to sort a list of pancakes of different sizes by flipping the pancakes.

Moreover, the code for `func_1` does not correctly call the `find_max_index` function. The `find_max_index` function is supposed to find the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[0:n]`, but the `func_1` function calls it with a single argument `curr_size`, which is not the correct way to use this function.

Additionally, the `flip` function is also not correctly implemented. It is supposed to reverse the order of elements in the list `arr` from the start to the specified `end` index, but it uses a while loop that swaps elements in the list, which is not an efficient way to reverse a list.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly implement a sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort or insertion sort, and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions need to be corrected to work correctly with the sorting algorithm.

A correct implementation of the `func_1` function would be:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

This code implements a bubble sort algorithm, which sorts the list in ascending order. It iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list, and the inner loop iterates `n - i - 1` times, where `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop. This is because the largest element is "bubbled" to the end of the list in each iteration of the outer loop, so there is no need to compare the last `i` elements in the inner loop.
