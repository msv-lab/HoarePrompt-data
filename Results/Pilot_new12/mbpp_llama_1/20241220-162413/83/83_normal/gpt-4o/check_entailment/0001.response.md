Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for several reasons:

1. The function `func_1` is trying to sort a list `arr`, but `arr` is not defined within the function. It seems that `arr` should be a parameter passed to the function.

2. The function `find_max_index` also uses `arr` which is not defined within its scope. Similar to `func_1`, `arr` should be passed as a parameter.

3. In the `flip` function, `arr` is again used without being defined. This function should also take `arr` as a parameter.

4. The `flip` function seems to be designed to reverse a part of the list, but it does not correctly implement this. The `while` loop condition should be `start < end`, but the update of `end` index seems incorrect as it does not ensure the swapping of elements at the start and end indices correctly.

5. The algorithm itself seems to be attempting a variant of the pancake sort, which is a well-known problem involving sorting a list of integers by only performing prefix reversals. However, the implementation provided does not correctly implement this algorithm. Specifically, it lacks the logic to correctly find the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and flip it to the beginning, and then flip it again to move it to its final sorted position.

A simple case where this program does not work as expected is when trying to sort the list `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`. The program does not have the necessary logic to correctly sort this list due to the issues mentioned above. 

If the code were corrected to properly define the array within the scope of the functions, implement the pancake sort algorithm correctly, and ensure that the `flip` function works as intended, it would look significantly different from the provided version and would correctly sort the list in all cases.
