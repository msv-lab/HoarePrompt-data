Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should sort a list of elements, which implies that the output should be in either ascending or descending order. However, the provided program returns a list sorted in descending order. 

While this may be considered a correct sort, the problem description does not specify whether the list should be sorted in ascending or descending order. In general, when the order is not specified, it is assumed to be ascending. 

Additionally, the program uses two helper functions: `find_max_index` and `flip`. The `find_max_index` function correctly finds the index of the maximum element in the given sublist, and the `flip` function correctly reverses the elements in the given range. However, the main function `func_1` uses these helper functions to implement a sorting algorithm that is similar to Selection Sort, but it sorts the list in descending order.

To make the program correct according to the problem description, it should be modified to sort the list in ascending order. This can be achieved by finding the index of the minimum element instead of the maximum element in each iteration of the `func_1` function.

Here's a simple modification to `find_max_index` function to find the minimum index:

```python
def find_min_index(n):
    min_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = i
    return min_index
```

Then, in the `func_1` function, use `find_min_index` instead of `find_max_index`, and swap the elements in the `flip` function calls if necessary to maintain the ascending order:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        min_index = find_min_index(curr_size)
        
        if min_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(min_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
            flip(min_index)
        
    return arr
```

However, this approach is still not the most efficient way to sort a list. A more conventional approach would be to implement a standard sorting algorithm, such as QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort, which have better time and space complexities.
