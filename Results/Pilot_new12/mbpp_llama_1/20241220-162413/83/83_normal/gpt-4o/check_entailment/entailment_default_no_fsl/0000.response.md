Correctness: **False**

The code provided is almost correct, but there are a few issues that prevent it from fully meeting the problem description.

Firstly, the `func_1` does not correctly implement the sorting function. The function is supposed to sort the list in ascending order, but the provided implementation seems to be an attempt to implement a pancake sort algorithm, which is used to sort a list in descending order.

Secondly, the `func_1` function uses the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions, but these functions are not defined in the same scope as `func_1`. The `arr` variable used in `find_max_index` and `flip` functions is also not defined.

Lastly, the code does not handle edge cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

But even with valid inputs, the code will still not work as expected. For example, if we call `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])`, the function will not return the correct sorted list because of the incorrect implementation of the sorting algorithm.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to correctly implement a sorting algorithm, and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions need to be defined in the same scope as `func_1` or passed as arguments to `func_1`. Additionally, the code should handle edge cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, although this is not required as per the problem statement. 

Here's an example of a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    def find_max_index(n):
        max_index = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = i
        return max_index

    def flip(end):
        start = 0
        while start < end:
            (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
```
This corrected version of the `func_1` function sorts the list in descending order, but to sort the list in ascending order, we can modify the `find_max_index` function to find the index of the minimum element instead of the maximum element.
