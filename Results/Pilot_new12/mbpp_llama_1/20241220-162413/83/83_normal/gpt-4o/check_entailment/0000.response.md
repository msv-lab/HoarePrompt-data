Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is attempting to implement a sorting algorithm, specifically a pancake sorting algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation.

Firstly, the `func_1` function is trying to use the `arr` variable which is not defined within its scope. The `arr` variable should be passed as a parameter to the function.

Secondly, the `find_max_index` function is also trying to use the `arr` variable which is not defined within its scope. The `arr` variable should be passed as a parameter to the function.

Lastly, even if the above issues are fixed, the pancake sorting algorithm implemented in `func_1` may not work correctly for all inputs. The algorithm is trying to find the maximum element in the unsorted part of the array and flip it to the end, but it does not handle the case when the maximum element is already at the end of the unsorted part.

A case when the program does not work correctly is when the input array is `[3, 1, 2]`. The `func_1` function will not correctly sort the array because it does not handle the case when the maximum element is already at the end of the unsorted part.

To fix these issues, the `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index` functions should be modified to correctly implement the pancake sorting algorithm, and the `arr` variable should be passed as a parameter to the `find_max_index` and `func_1` functions. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation of the pancake sorting algorithm:
```python
def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index)
            flip(arr, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```
