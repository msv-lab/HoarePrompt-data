Correctness: **False**

The problem description specifies that the function should sort a list of elements. However, the provided code sorts the list in descending order, not in ascending order as is typically implied by the term "sort". The function `func_1` uses the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions to rearrange the elements in the list, but it does so in a way that places the largest elements first, resulting in a descending order sort.

Furthermore, the code does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements. While we assume that the input will be valid, the function's behavior in these cases is still undefined.

Additionally, the `find_max_index` function does not handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, despite the annotations suggesting that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. This could potentially lead to an error if `n` is larger than the length of `arr`.

Finally, the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should sort the list in-place, but the provided code does so by modifying the original list. If the problem description intended for the function to return a new sorted list without modifying the original, then the provided code does not meet the requirements.

Overall, while the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implemented, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
