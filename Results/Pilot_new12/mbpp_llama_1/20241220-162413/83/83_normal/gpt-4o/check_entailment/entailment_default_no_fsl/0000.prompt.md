You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the same list sorted in descending order, with its length unchanged. The function operates on the input list in-place, modifying it directly, and does not create a new sorted list. The sorting process is achieved through a series of flips or swaps, utilizing the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions, which are not defined within this code snippet but are assumed to be available. After the function executes, the input list `arr` will be sorted in descending order, and its length will remain the same as the original input. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, and it assumes that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are correctly implemented to work with the list.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip` reverses the order of elements in the list `arr` from the start (index 0) to the specified `end` index. It modifies the original list in-place and does not return any value. After execution, the elements in `arr` between indices 0 and the original value of `end` are reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The function handles cases where `end` is 0 or greater, up to but not including the length of `arr`, and does not explicitly handle cases where `end` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr` or less than 0, as these are assumed to be invalid inputs based on the provided annotations. If `arr` has one or zero elements, or if `end` is 0, the function does not alter the list, effectively acting as an identity function for these edge cases. The function's effect is solely on the input list `arr`, and it does not produce a new list or value as output.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `n` and a list `arr`. It returns the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[0:n]`. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as there are no elements in the sublist. If `n` is 1, the function will return 0, as there is only one element in the sublist. For `n` greater than 1, the function will iterate through the sublist and return the index of the maximum element. If all elements in the sublist are equal, the function will return 0, as it is the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element. The function does not modify the input list `arr` and does not handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, although the annotations suggest that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. However, the actual code does not check for this condition, and it is assumed that `arr` is defined and accessible within the function's scope, although it is not passed as a parameter to the function.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
