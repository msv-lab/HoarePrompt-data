To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the provided output states.

The loop iterates from `n` (the length of `arr`) down to `2`, and in each iteration, it finds the maximum element within the current size (`curr_size`) of the array. If the maximum element is not at the last index of the current size, it flips the elements at the maximum index and the last index of the current size.

From the provided output states, we can infer the following patterns:

1.  The array `arr` is modified based on the location of its maximum element within the decreasing `curr_size`.
2.  The variable `n` remains the length of the modified `arr` and is greater than `1` for the loop to execute.
3.  The `curr_size` variable decreases by `1` in each iteration, indicating that the loop operates on a shrinking portion of the array.
4.  If the maximum element is not at the last index of the current size, the elements up to the second last index are reversed, considering any previous reversals.

Considering these patterns and the loop code, after all iterations have finished:

*   The loop will have iterated `n - 1` times (from `n` down to `2`), modifying the array based on the maximum element's location within the decreasing `curr_size`.
*   The `arr` will be sorted in descending order because, in each iteration, the maximum element within the current size is moved to the end of that size.
*   The `n` variable will still hold the length of the original array, now sorted in descending order.
*   The `curr_size` variable will be `1` after the loop finishes because the loop iterates until `curr_size` reaches `2`.
*   The functions `find_max_index` and `flip` will have been used to modify the array, but their final state is not directly relevant to the output state.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `n` is the length of the sorted `arr`, `curr_size` is 2.**
