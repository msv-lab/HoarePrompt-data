According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3 and `n` <= `len(arr)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `i` is 3, and if `arr[3]` > `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` is 3**
