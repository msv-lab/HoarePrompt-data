The code updates the value of `max_index` to `i`. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 2 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `max_index` was 0, `i` is 1, and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`. 

After executing the code, the value of `max_index` becomes `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 2 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 2 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1**
