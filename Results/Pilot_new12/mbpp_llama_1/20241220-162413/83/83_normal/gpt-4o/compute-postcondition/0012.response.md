The program returns `max_index` which is the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[0:n]`. Here, `arr` is a list of elements and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` <= `len(arr)`. 

Output State: **The program returns the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[0:n]`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `arr` is a list of elements**
