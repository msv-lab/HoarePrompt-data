Functionality: **The function accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the same list sorted in descending order, with its length unchanged. The function operates on the input list in-place, modifying it directly, and does not create a new sorted list. The sorting process is achieved through a series of flips or swaps, utilizing the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions, which are not defined within this code snippet but are assumed to be available. After the function executes, the input list `arr` will be sorted in descending order, and its length will remain the same as the original input. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, and it assumes that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are correctly implemented to work with the list.**
