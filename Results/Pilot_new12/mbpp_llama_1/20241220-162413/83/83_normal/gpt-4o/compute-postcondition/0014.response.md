Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `n` and a list `arr`. It returns the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[0:n]`. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as there are no elements in the sublist. If `n` is 1, the function will return 0, as there is only one element in the sublist. For `n` greater than 1, the function will iterate through the sublist and return the index of the maximum element. If all elements in the sublist are equal, the function will return 0, as it is the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element. The function does not modify the input list `arr` and does not handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, although the annotations suggest that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. However, the actual code does not check for this condition, and it is assumed that `arr` is defined and accessible within the function's scope, although it is not passed as a parameter to the function.**
