`max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 3 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `i` is 2, and `max_index` is 2.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 3 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `i` is 2, and `max_index` is 2**
