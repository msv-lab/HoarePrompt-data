The code assigns `max_index` the value of `i`. Since `i` is 3, `max_index` will be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The condition `if arr[3] > arr[max_index], then max_index is 3` is still valid because now `max_index` is indeed 3, and this condition was true before, so it is still true that `if arr[3] > arr[max_index]`, then indeed `max_index` equals 3.
Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3, and if `arr[3]` > `arr[max_index]`, then this condition holds true because `max_index` equals 3.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3**
