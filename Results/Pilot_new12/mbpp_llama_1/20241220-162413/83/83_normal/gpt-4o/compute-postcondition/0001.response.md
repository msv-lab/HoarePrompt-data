According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2`, because if `n` is `0` or `1`, the loop will not execute. 

Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0` <= `n` <= `len(arr)`, and `max_index` is `0`. However, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be at least `2`. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be `1`. The state of `arr` and `max_index` remains unchanged as they are not directly related to the loop execution.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 2 and `n` <= `len(arr)`, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
