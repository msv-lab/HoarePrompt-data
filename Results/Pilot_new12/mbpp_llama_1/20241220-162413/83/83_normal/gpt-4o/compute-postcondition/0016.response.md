Postcondition: **`arr` is modified based on the location of its maximum element, `n` is the length of the modified `arr` and is greater than 1, `curr_size` is `n - 2`. If `max_index` is not at the last position of the array of size `n - 2`, then the elements up to `n - 3` in `arr` are flipped, potentially changing `max_index` if the original maximum element was within the flipped section.**
