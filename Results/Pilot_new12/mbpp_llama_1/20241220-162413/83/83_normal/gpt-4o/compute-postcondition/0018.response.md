The program returns the array `arr`. We know that `arr` is sorted in descending order and its length is `n`. Additionally, we have a variable `curr_size` which is 2, but it does not affect the return value of `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns array `arr` which is sorted in descending order and has a length of `n`.**
