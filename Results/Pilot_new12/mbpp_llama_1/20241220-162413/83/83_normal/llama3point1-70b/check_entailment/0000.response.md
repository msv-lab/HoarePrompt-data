Correctness: **False**

The provided program implements a sorting algorithm, but it does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

A case where this program does not work correctly is when the input list is already sorted in descending order. For example, if the input list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the program will return the same list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` which is not the correct sorted list.

Another issue with this program is its time complexity. The `index()` method in Python has a time complexity of O(n), and it is called inside a loop with a range of `n`. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2) for the `index()` method alone, aside from the sorting operation. This can lead to performance issues with large input lists.

A correct sorting algorithm, such as quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort, should be used to sort the list in ascending order. The provided program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, so it is considered incorrect. 

In general, a correct sorting function should return a list that is sorted in ascending order, and it should handle edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with duplicate elements, and lists that are already sorted. The provided program does not meet these requirements. 

Here is an example of a correct sorting function in Python:

```python
def sorting_function(arr):
    arr.sort()
    return arr
```

Or using built-in function `sorted()`:

```python
def sorting_function(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```
