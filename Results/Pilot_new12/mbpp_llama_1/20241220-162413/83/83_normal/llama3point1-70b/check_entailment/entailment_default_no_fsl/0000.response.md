Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement a general list sorting function as described in the problem description. It only handles sorting lists in descending order and does not provide a way to sort in ascending order, which is typically expected from a general-purpose sorting function.

The problem description asks to write a function to sort a list of elements, which implies that the function should be able to sort the list in either ascending or descending order, depending on the requirements. However, the given code only sorts the list in descending order.

A correct implementation would provide an option to choose the sorting order, either through a parameter passed to the function or by following a standard convention (e.g., sorting in ascending order by default).

Additionally, while the output hints mention that the function modifies the input list in-place and handles edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element, this does not cover all potential use cases as implied by the problem description. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains elements of different types that are not comparable (e.g., mixing numbers and strings), which could lead to runtime errors.

Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description and thus is considered incorrect for every potential case.
