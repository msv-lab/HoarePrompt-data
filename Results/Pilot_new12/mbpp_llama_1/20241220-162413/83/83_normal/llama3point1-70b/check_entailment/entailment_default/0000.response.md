Correctness: **False**

The code provided attempts to sort a list of elements, but it does not meet the problem description's requirements. The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements, but it does not specify the sorting order. However, the output hints mention that the function returns the array sorted in descending order. 

A closer examination of the code reveals that it uses a modified version of the selection sort algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly finds the maximum element from the unsorted part of the list and moves it to the end of the unsorted part. However, the algorithm used here is complex and may not be efficient for large lists. 

Moreover, the code does not handle the case where the input list contains uncomparable elements or non-comparable data types (like strings and integers), although this might be out of the scope of the problem.

The key issue here, however, is the problem description does not specify the sorting order, and the code sorts the list in descending order. The function should either sort the list in ascending order or both ascending and descending order depending on the input.

Thus, the provided code does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case, so the correctness is **False**. 

If the problem description were modified to specify descending order, or if an additional parameter were added to the function to allow the user to choose the sorting order, the code could be considered correct. However, as it stands, the code does not meet the requirements.
