Correctness: **False**

The given program is an attempt to implement a sorting function using a modified version of the "pancake sort" algorithm. However, this implementation has a major flaw. 

One potential case where the program does not work as expected is when the input list contains duplicate elements. The `index()` function in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element, which can lead to incorrect results when there are duplicate maximum elements. 

For example, if we pass the list `[3, 2, 3, 1]` to the function, the `index()` function will always return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element, which is 0. As a result, the function will not be able to correctly sort the list.

Here's an example:

```python
print(func_1([3, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: [3, 2, 3, 1]
```

As you can see, the function does not correctly sort the list. This is because the `index()` function does not correctly handle duplicate elements. Therefore, the Correctness of this program is **False**. 

A correct sorting function would need to handle duplicate elements correctly, for example, by using a different sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort, or by using a modified version of the pancake sort algorithm that correctly handles duplicates.
