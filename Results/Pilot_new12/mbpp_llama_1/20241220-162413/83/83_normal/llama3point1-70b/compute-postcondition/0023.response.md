The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements. After executing the function body, if the original number of elements `n` in `arr` is greater than 0, the function returns the array `arr` sorted in descending order. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the array either sorted in descending order if the original number of elements in `arr` is greater than 0, or the original array if the condition is not met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of elements arr and returns the array sorted in descending order if the original number of elements in arr is greater than 0, otherwise returns the original array.**
