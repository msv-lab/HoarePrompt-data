Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 1, `size` is `n - 2`. If `max_index` is not 0, then `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed and `max_index` is updated to the new index of the maximum element in the reversed `arr[:n-2]`. If `max_index` is 0, then no changes are made to `arr`.***
