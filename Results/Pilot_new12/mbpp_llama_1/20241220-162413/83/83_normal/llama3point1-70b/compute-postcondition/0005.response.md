The given code snippet reverses the slice of the list `arr` from the start up to and including the `max_index`. Given that `max_index` is the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr` and is neither at the first index (0) nor at the last index (`size - 1`) of the considered slice, this operation will change the order of elements in `arr` up to `max_index + 1`.

The value of `n` remains greater than 0. The `size` is still equal to `n`. The value of `max_index` is updated because the maximum value within the reversed slice is now at a different position. Since the slice was reversed, the original maximum value (which was at `max_index`) will now be at the beginning of the reversed slice, which is at index 0 of the reversed part of the list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with its first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is 0, because after reversing, the maximum value is moved to the first position of the reversed slice.**
