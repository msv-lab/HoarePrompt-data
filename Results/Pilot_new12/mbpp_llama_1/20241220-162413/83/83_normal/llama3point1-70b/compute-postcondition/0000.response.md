The code `n = len(arr)` assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The previous value of `arr` is still valid, so it remains a list of elements. The length of `arr` is now assigned to `n`, which means `n` is equal to the number of elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`**
