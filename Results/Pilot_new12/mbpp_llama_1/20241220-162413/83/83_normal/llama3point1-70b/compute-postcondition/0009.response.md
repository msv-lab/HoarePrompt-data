According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to `n` which is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be decreased by 1. 
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`**
