The given code snippet reverses the elements in the list `arr` up to the index `max_index + 1`. The value of `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`. After the code execution, the elements in `arr[:max_index + 1]` are reversed. The rest of the list remains unchanged.

The states of the variables `n` and `size` are not affected by the code. The value of `size` is still `n - 2`, and `n` is still greater than 1. However, the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`, which is `max_index`, may change because the elements up to `max_index + 1` have been reversed.

Output State: **`arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, `n` is greater than 1, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the new index of the maximum element in the reversed `arr[:n-2]`.**
