Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the elements up to index `max_index` in `arr` are reversed, and `max_index` is updated to the index of the maximum value from the end of the reversed subarray at index `max_index`. If `max_index` is 0, no modifications are made to `arr` and `max_index` remains the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to index `n-1`.***
