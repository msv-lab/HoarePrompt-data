According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements and `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, and `size` is `n`. 
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
