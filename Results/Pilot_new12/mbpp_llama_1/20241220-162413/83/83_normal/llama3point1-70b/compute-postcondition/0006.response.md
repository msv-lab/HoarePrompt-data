Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, resulting in `max_index` being 0 after the reversal, because the maximum value is moved to the first position of the reversed slice. If `max_index` is 0, no reversal occurs.***
