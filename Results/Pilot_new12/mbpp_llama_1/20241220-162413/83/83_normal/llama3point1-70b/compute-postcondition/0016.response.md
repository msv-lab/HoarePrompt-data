To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given code snippet does. The code `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element in the list `arr` up to the index `size - 1` (since list slicing in Python is up to but not including the end index). 

Given that `size` is `n - 2`, the list slicing `arr[:size]` will consider elements from the start of the list up to the `n - 3` index (because the `size` is `n - 2`, and Python uses zero-based indexing). 

The `max()` function finds the maximum value in the sliced list, and the `index()` method then finds the index of this maximum value within the entire list `arr`. Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the maximum value, `index()` will return the index of the first occurrence.

Since `n` is greater than 1, and `size` is `n - 2`, we know that `size` is at least `-1` (when `n` is 1, which is not possible given the constraint that `n` is greater than 1) but since `n` is greater than 1, `size` will be at least 0 (when `n` is 2), ensuring there's at least one element to consider in `arr[:size]`.

The values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` are not changed by this operation; a new variable `max_index` is introduced which holds the index of the maximum element found in the specified slice of `arr`.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 1, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` up to the index `size - 1`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 1, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:n-2]`.**
