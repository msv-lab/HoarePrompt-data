The given Python code snippet reverses the elements of `arr` up to index `size`, which is `n - 1`. This means the entire list `arr` except the last element (if `n` is equal to the length of `arr`) will be reversed. 

The previous conditions regarding `max_index` no longer apply after the execution of this code because `arr[:size]` is reversed, which could change the position of the maximum value. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `size` is `n - 1`, after the reversal, `arr` up to index `n - 1` will be in reverse order.

Output State: **`arr` up to index `n - 1` is reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`.**
