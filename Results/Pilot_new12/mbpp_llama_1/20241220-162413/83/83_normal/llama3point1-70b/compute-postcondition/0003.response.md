Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr`. The current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, meaning the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr` is not at the last index of the considered slice.**
