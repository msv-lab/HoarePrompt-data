Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`. If the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr` is not at the last position of the considered slice, then `arr` has its elements reversed and `max_index` becomes 0. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `max_index` being the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
