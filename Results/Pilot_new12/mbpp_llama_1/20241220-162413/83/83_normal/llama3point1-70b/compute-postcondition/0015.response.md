According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again, and `size` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n - 1` (which is greater than 0 since `n` is greater than 0) and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be decremented by 1, so `size` becomes `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `size` is now `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 1, `size` is `n - 2`**
