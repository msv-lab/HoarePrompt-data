To calculate the output state after running the given Python code snippet, let's break down what the code does and then apply that to the initial conditions.

The given code snippet is:
```python
max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `arr` is a list of elements.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `size` is `n`.

The code does the following:
1. `arr[:size]` creates a slice of the list `arr` from the beginning up to the `size`-th index. Since `size` is equal to `n`, this slice includes the first `n` elements of `arr`.
2. `max(arr[:size])` finds the maximum value within this slice of `arr`.
3. `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value found in step 2 within the entire list `arr`, not just the slice.

The key points to note are:
- `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr`, but this index is relative to the whole list `arr`, not just the slice.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` are not changed by this operation.

Given these considerations, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value within the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
