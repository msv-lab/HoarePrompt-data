To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `arr` is a list of elements
- `n` is greater than 0
- `size` is `n - 1`

The code is:
```python
max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
```

This line of code does the following:
1. `arr[:size]` creates a slice of the list `arr` from the start up to but not including the index `size`.
2. `max(arr[:size])` finds the maximum value in this slice of the list.
3. `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value in the entire list `arr`.

Given that `size` is `n - 1`, the slice `arr[:size]` effectively considers all elements of `arr` except possibly the last one (since `n` is the length of `arr` implied by `n` being greater than 0 and `size` being `n - 1`).

The variable `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum value found in the slice `arr[:size]`. This means `max_index` will hold the index of the maximum value in `arr` excluding the last element (if `n` equals the length of `arr`).

The output state is therefore:
- `arr` is a list of elements
- `n` is greater than 0
- `size` is `n - 1`
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]`, which means it's the index of the maximum value in `arr` excluding the last element if `n` equals the length of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to index `n-1`.**
