The function accepts a list of elements `arr` and returns the array sorted in descending order if the original number of elements in `arr` is greater than 0. If the original number of elements in `arr` is 0, the function returns the original array, which remains unchanged. The function handles potential edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with a single element, and returns the original list in these cases. Additionally, the function modifies the input list `arr` in-place, meaning that the original list is modified during the sorting process. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains uncomparable elements. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input list `arr` has been modified to be sorted in descending order if it was not empty, and the original number of elements in `arr` is preserved.
