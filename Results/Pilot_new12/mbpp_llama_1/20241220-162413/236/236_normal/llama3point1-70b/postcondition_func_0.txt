The function takes a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. The input list itself remains unmodified. The function correctly handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and considers duplicate elements as valid in a sorted list. It also correctly handles lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as strings or numbers. The function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise, covering all potential edge cases, including lists with a single element, empty lists, and lists with multiple elements in both ascending and descending order.
