Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted or not. The function works by comparing the input list with its sorted version, which is obtained using the built-in `sorted` function. If the input list is already sorted, it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are already sorted: The function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will correctly return `False`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will correctly return `True` if the list is sorted (even if there are duplicates) and `False` otherwise.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. While this may not be the most efficient approach for large lists (a simple iterative comparison would have a time complexity of O(n)), it is still a correct solution that meets the problem description. 

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
