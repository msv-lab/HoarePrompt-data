Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, as per the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Comparison with sorted list**: The function `func_1` returns `True` if the input list `nums` is equal to its sorted version (`sorted(nums)`). This comparison effectively checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Handling of edge cases**: The program correctly handles various edge cases:
   - **Empty lists**: An empty list is considered sorted, and the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` for an empty list.
   - **Single-element lists**: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the comparison will return `True`.
   - **Lists with duplicate elements**: The comparison will return `True` for lists with duplicate elements, as long as the list is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Lists with elements of different data types**: The comparison will work correctly for lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as strings or numbers.

3. **Input validation**: As per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

4. **Function behavior**: The function takes a list of comparable elements as input, returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order, and does not modify the input list.

In summary, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and its behavior is consistent with the expected output for various input scenarios.
