Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the input list with its sorted version. The function `func_1(nums)` returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. 

The code handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with multiple elements in both ascending and descending order, and lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared. 

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about its behavior. The function correctly considers duplicate elements as valid in a sorted list and handles lists of any size.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
