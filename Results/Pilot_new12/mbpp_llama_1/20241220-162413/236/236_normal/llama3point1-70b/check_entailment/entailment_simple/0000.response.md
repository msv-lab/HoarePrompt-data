Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not by comparing the original list with its sorted version using the `sorted` function. 

This approach works because the `sorted` function in Python returns a new list that contains all items from the original list in ascending order. By comparing the original list with the sorted list using the `==` operator, the function is able to determine if the original list is already sorted in ascending order.

The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the list is sorted, which aligns with the problem description. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function will work correctly for all potential valid inputs. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True` because the list is already sorted. If the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1]`, the function will return `False` because the list is not sorted. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
