Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list and then compares the sorted list with the original list. If they are equal, it means the original list is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function returns `True`.
- Single-element lists: A list with one element is considered sorted, and the function returns `True`.
- Already sorted lists: If the list is already sorted, the function returns `True`.
- Unsorted lists: If the list is not sorted, the function returns `False`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function works correctly even if the list contains duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers or floating-point numbers: The function works correctly with lists containing negative numbers or floating-point numbers.

The function handles all these cases correctly because it relies on Python's `sorted` function, which is a stable sort and works correctly for all types of lists. Therefore, the function is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
