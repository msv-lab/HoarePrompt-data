You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted or not. The function works by comparing the input list with its sorted version, which is obtained using the built-in `sorted` function. If the input list is already sorted, it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are already sorted: The function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will correctly return `False`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will correctly return `True` if the list is sorted (even if there are duplicates) and `False` otherwise.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. While this may not be the most efficient approach for large lists (a simple iterative comparison would have a time complexity of O(n)), it is still a correct solution that meets the problem description. 

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. The input list itself remains unmodified. The function correctly handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and considers duplicate elements as valid in a sorted list. It also correctly handles lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as strings or numbers. The function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise, covering all potential edge cases, including lists with a single element, empty lists, and lists with multiple elements in both ascending and descending order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
