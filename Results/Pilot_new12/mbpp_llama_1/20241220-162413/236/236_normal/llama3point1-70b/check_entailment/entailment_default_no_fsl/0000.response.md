Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function checks whether a given list is sorted in ascending order. It uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the input list and then compares the sorted list with the original list. If the two lists are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach correctly handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with multiple elements in both ascending and descending order, and lists containing duplicate elements or elements of different data types (like strings or numbers). The function is simple yet robust and covers all potential cases as described in the problem description. 

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function returns `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order. For the input `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the function returns `False` because the list is sorted in descending order, not ascending order. The function also correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, such as `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, where it returns `True` because the list is still sorted in ascending order.

Given that the input will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and considering that the function handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, the code is correct.
