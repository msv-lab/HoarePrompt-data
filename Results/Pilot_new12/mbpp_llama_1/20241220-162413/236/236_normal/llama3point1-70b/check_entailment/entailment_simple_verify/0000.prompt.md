You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted or not. The function works by comparing the input list with its sorted version, which is obtained using the built-in `sorted` function. If the input list is already sorted, it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are already sorted: The function will correctly return `True`.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will correctly return `False`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will correctly return `True` if the list is sorted (even if there are duplicates) and `False` otherwise.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. While this may not be the most efficient approach for large lists (a simple iterative comparison would have a time complexity of O(n)), it is still a correct solution that meets the problem description. 

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
