Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates over the list, comparing each element with its next one. If it finds an element that is greater than its next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases:

- A sorted list: The function returns `True`.
- A list with two elements that are not in order: The function returns `False`.
- A list with multiple elements that are not in order: The function returns `False`.
- A list with duplicate elements: The function returns `True` if the list is sorted, and `False` otherwise.
- An empty list: Although not explicitly tested, the function would return `True` for an empty list, which could be considered correct or incorrect depending on the definition of a sorted list. However, in most contexts, an empty list is considered sorted.

The function does not handle non-numeric elements or non-list inputs. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle these cases, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be a list of numbers.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles all potential cases and returns the expected output.
