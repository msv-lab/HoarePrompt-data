The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` indeed checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing each element with its next one. If an element is greater than its next one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The output hints support this assessment by providing examples of the function's behavior. They clarify that the function considers a list with less than two elements to be sorted by default, which is consistent with the function's implementation.

The function does not need to handle non-numeric elements or non-list inputs because the problem description assumes that the input will be a list of numbers. The function also does not need to handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with duplicate elements because these cases are either explicitly or implicitly covered by the function's implementation.

The output hints also confirm that the function does not modify the input list, which is consistent with the function's implementation.

Based on the output hints, the program, and the reasoning, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality.

Final: **True**
