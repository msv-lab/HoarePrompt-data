Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list is sorted in ascending order. The function iterates over the list, comparing each element with its next adjacent element. If it finds any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles lists of any length, including lists with less than two elements, which are considered sorted by default. The unit tests provided also validate this behavior, showing that the function correctly identifies sorted and unsorted lists, as well as lists with less than two elements.

Since the problem description asks for a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, and the provided function does exactly that for all potential cases, the code is correct. The function does not modify the input list and works with lists of comparable elements, fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description and the output hints.
