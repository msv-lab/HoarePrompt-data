Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

- It iterates over the list using a for loop, comparing each element with its next element.
- If it finds a pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
- If the loop completes without finding any such pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

- The first test case `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.
- The second test case `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted in ascending order (20 is followed by 17).
- The third test case `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted in ascending order (15 is followed by 14).

Overall, the function `func_1` accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, as required by the problem description.
