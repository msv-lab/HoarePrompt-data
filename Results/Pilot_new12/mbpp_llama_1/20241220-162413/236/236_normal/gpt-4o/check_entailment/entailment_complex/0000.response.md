Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order or not. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, comparing each element with the next one. If it finds a pair of elements where the first one is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

2. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

3. The function handles lists with less than two elements correctly by returning `True`, as these lists are considered sorted by default.

4. The function does not modify the input list, as required.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- The first test checks a sorted list and the function returns `True`.
- The second test checks a list that is not sorted and the function returns `False`.
- The third test checks another list that is not sorted and the function returns `False`.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order or not, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
