#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, sorted in ascending order if it has at least two elements; otherwise, its original state remains unchanged. The loop does not modify `lst`.
    return True
    #The program returns a boolean value True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list has at least two elements and is sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`. If the list has at least two elements and is not sorted in ascending order, the function returns `False`. If the list has less than two elements, the function returns `True` as the list is considered sorted by default. The function does not modify the input list.
