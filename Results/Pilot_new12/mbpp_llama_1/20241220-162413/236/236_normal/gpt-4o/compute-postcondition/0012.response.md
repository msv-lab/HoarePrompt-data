The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value. The function has multiple return cases, but only one case is fulfilled, and the rest are not. However, the problem description does not specify the conditions under which each case returns False, but it does state that there is a case where the function returns True. 

Given the lack of specificity on the conditions that determine the return value of False in cases 1 through 3, and the return value of True in case 4, the functionality of the function can be described as follows: 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value based on unspecified conditions within the function body.**
