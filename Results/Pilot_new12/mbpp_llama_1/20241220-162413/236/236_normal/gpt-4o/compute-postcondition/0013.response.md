Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list has at least two elements and is sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`. If the list has at least two elements and is not sorted in ascending order, the function returns `False`. If the list has less than two elements, the function returns `True` as the list is considered sorted by default. The function does not modify the input list.**
