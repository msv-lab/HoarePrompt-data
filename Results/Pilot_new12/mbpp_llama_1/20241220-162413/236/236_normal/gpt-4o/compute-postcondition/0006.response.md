Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the condition `lst[i]` less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]` is maintained, as this is the only other possible case given the if condition.***
