To solve this problem, we'll analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: 
- `main_string` is a string
- `sub_string` is a string
- `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`.

The code provided is:
```python
end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
```

Based on this code, `end_pos` is calculated by adding the length of `sub_string` to `start_pos`. Since `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, adding the length of `sub_string` to `start_pos` gives the position right after the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. 

Therefore, the value of `end_pos` is equal to `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which represents the end position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`.

Given that `start_pos` is not -1 and `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, `start_pos` and `end_pos` are both valid indices for `main_string`, with `end_pos` being greater than `start_pos` by the length of `sub_string`.

The states of `main_string` and `sub_string` remain unchanged as strings, and `start_pos` remains the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. The new variable `end_pos` is introduced, which is `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and `end_pos` is `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.**
