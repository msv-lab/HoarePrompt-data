The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, the function returns a tuple with the `sub_string`, its start position (the index of the first character of `sub_string` in `main_string`), and its end position (the index after the last character of `sub_string` in `main_string`). If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`. The function effectively locates the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string` and provides the details of this occurrence, or indicates that no occurrence was found. The function does not modify either of the input strings.
