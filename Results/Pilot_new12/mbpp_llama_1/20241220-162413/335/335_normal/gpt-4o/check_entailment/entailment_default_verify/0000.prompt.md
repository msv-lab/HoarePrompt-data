You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. 

Here's why the code is correct:
- It correctly uses the `find()` method to get the starting position of the substring.
- If the substring is not found, `find()` returns `-1` and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the end position by adding the length of the substring to the start position, which is mathematically correct.

All the provided unit tests pass with the expected results, and there are no obvious edge cases where the function would fail to work as expected. For example, it handles cases where the substring is at the beginning or end of the string, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found. 

In general, if a string is searched for a substring, and the substring is found at position `i`, then the end position of the substring will be `i + length_of_substring - 1`, or equivalently, `i + length_of_substring` will be one position to the right of the end of the substring, which is what the function returns as the end position. 

Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases and the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, the function returns a tuple with the `sub_string`, its start position (the index of the first character of `sub_string` in `main_string`), and its end position (the index after the last character of `sub_string` in `main_string`). If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`. The function effectively locates the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string` and provides the details of this occurrence, or indicates that no occurrence was found. The function does not modify either of the input strings.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
