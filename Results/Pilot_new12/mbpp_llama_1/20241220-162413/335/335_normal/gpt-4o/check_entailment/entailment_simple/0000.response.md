Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns `None` if there is no match.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It uses the `find` method to search for the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`.

2. If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of `sub_string` to the start position.

3. The function then returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position.

The function handles all cases as described in the problem description:

- It returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`.
- It returns the correct start and end positions of `sub_string` if it is found in `main_string`.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function. They cover different scenarios, including cases where the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and cases where the substring is not found.

Overall, the function correctly implements the required functionality, and its behavior matches the problem description.
