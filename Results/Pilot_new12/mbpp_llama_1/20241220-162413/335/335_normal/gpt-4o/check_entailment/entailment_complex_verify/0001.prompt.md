You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within a string and returns the substring, its start position, and end position. If there is no match, it returns None.

The `find()` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns -1. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `start_pos` is -1 and returning None if it is.

The program also correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the program works as expected in different scenarios, including when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found at all.

Overall, based on the provided code and unit tests, it seems that the program correctly implements the specified functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string and sub_string are strings.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`.
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns sub_string which is a string, start_pos which is the position of the first occurrence of sub_string in main_string, and end_pos which is start_pos plus the length of sub_string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, the function returns a tuple with the `sub_string`, its start position (the index of the first character of `sub_string` in `main_string`), and its end position (the index after the last character of `sub_string` in `main_string`). If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`. The function effectively locates the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string` and provides the details of this occurrence, or indicates that no occurrence was found. The function does not modify either of the input strings.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
