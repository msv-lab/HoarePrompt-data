Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is designed to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns None if there is no match. We have verified that the code works as expected for various test cases. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns either None or a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position within `main_string`. The function uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it calculates the end position by adding the length of `sub_string` to the start position, and returns the tuple with the required information. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns None.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. For example, when `main_string` is `'python programming, python language'` and `sub_string` is `'python'`, the function correctly returns `('python', 0, 6)`. When `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, as in the case where `main_string` is `'c++ programming, c++ language'` and `sub_string` is `'python'`, the function returns `None`.

The output hints agree with the code and the provided unit tests, which further confirms that the code is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, we conclude that the code is correct.
