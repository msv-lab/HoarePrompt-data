Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` finds the occurrence and position of the substring within a string and returns `None` if there is no match.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. The function accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, which is in line with the problem description.
2. The function uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and returns its start position. If `sub_string` is not found, `find()` returns -1, and the function returns `None`, as specified in the problem description.
3. If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates its end position by adding the length of `sub_string` to its start position and returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position.
4. The function does not modify the input strings, which is also in line with the problem description.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including when the substring is found at different positions and when it's not found at all.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the expected input correctly, it is considered correct.
