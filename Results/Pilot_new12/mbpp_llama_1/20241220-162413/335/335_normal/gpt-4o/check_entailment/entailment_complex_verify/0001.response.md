The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the specified functionality of finding the occurrence and position of the first substring within a string and returns the substring, its start position, and end position. If there is no match, it returns None.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. It clearly describes the state of the program at different points and confirms that the program behaves as expected. The annotations show that the program correctly handles the case when the substring is found and when it is not found.

The annotated code states that `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`. This is consistent with the problem description. The annotations also show that the program correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

Additionally, the annotated code confirms that the function does not modify either of the input strings, which is in line with the problem description.

The unit tests provided also suggest that the program works as expected in different scenarios, including when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found at all.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
