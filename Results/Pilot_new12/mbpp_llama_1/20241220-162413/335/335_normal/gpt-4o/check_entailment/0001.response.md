Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within a string and returns the substring, its start position, and end position. If there is no match, it returns None.

The `find()` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns -1. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `start_pos` is -1 and returning None if it is.

The program also correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the program works as expected in different scenarios, including when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found at all.

Overall, based on the provided code and unit tests, it seems that the program correctly implements the specified functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
