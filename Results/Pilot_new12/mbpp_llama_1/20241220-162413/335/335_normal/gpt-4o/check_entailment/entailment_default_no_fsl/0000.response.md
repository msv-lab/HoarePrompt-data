Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns None if there is no match. 

The `func_1` function correctly uses the `find` method of the string to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and if found, it returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its start position, and its end position. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function for different scenarios, including when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found in the main string.

The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the main string or the substring is empty, although these cases are not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests.

Overall, the code provided seems to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
