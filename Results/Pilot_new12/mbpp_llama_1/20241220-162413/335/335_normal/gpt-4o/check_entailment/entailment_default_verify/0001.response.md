Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position if the substring is found, and returns None if the substring is not found.

The output hints provide a clear description of the function's behavior and match the code's implementation. The hints state that the function returns either None or a tuple with the substring, its start position, and its end position, which is consistent with the code.

The code also correctly handles the edge case where the substring is not found in the main string, as demonstrated by the unit test `assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None`.

The original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct is supported by the provided code and output hints. The assessment correctly identifies that the program uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring, and that it correctly calculates the end position of the substring.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
