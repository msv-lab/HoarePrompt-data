Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment that the program is correct.

The original assessment makes sense because it accurately describes the behavior of the program. The program uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring within the main string, and if it is not found, it returns None. The program also correctly calculates the end position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior, but it does not reveal any issues that would contradict the original assessment. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, and they confirm that the program returns the expected results.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and I conclude that the program is correct.

The reason I believe the original assessment is accurate is that the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns None if there is no match. The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program works as expected in different scenarios.

Final: **True**
