Based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, returning `None` if there is no match.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, returning a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position within the main string if the substring is found, or `None` if it is not found. The hints also note that the function does not modify the input strings and effectively locates the first occurrence of the substring within the main string.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various cases, including finding substrings at the beginning, middle, and end of the main string, as well as not finding a substring. The function passes all these tests with the expected results.

One possible consideration is that the function returns the end position as the index after the last character of the substring, rather than the index of the last character itself. However, this is a common convention in string indexing, and the output hints explicitly state that the end position is the index after the last character of the substring. Therefore, this does not seem to be a discrepancy.

Overall, the evidence from the code, the original assessment, and the output hints all support the conclusion that the function is correct.

Final: **True**
