The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the provided code and unit tests. The assessment highlights the correct usage of the `find()` method, proper handling of cases where the substring is not found, and accurate calculation of the end position of the substring.

The annotated version of the code provides a step-by-step breakdown of the program's behavior and confirms the original assessment. The annotations demonstrate that the program correctly handles the input strings, finds the start position of the substring, and calculates the end position.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the program appears to meet the requirements. The program finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns `None` if there is no match.

One potential point of discussion is the definition of the end position. The problem description does not explicitly state whether the end position should be the index of the last character of the substring or the index after the last character. However, the provided unit tests and the annotated code suggest that the end position is intended to be the index after the last character, which is consistent with the program's behavior.

Therefore, based on the available information, the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness is confirmed.

Final: **True**
