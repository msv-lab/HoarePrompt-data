Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. 

Here's why the code is correct:
- It correctly uses the `find()` method to get the starting position of the substring.
- If the substring is not found, `find()` returns `-1` and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the end position by adding the length of the substring to the start position, which is mathematically correct.

All the provided unit tests pass with the expected results, and there are no obvious edge cases where the function would fail to work as expected. For example, it handles cases where the substring is at the beginning or end of the string, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found. 

In general, if a string is searched for a substring, and the substring is found at position `i`, then the end position of the substring will be `i + length_of_substring - 1`, or equivalently, `i + length_of_substring` will be one position to the right of the end of the substring, which is what the function returns as the end position. 

Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases and the correctness is **True**.
