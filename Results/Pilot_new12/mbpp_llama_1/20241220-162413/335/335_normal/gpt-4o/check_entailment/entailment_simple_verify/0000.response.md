To determine the program's correctness, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

The problem description asks for a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It should return `None` if there is no match.

The original assessment concludes that the function `func_1` is correct. Here's why:

- It uses the `find()` method to get the starting position of the substring, which is the correct approach.
- If the substring is not found, `find()` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the end position by adding the length of the substring to the start position. Although the end position is calculated as one position to the right of the actual end of the substring, the assessment considers this to be correct based on the provided unit tests.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior:

- Before the function call, `main_string` and `sub_string` are strings.
- After the `if` block is executed, `start_pos` is the position of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and it is not equal to `-1`, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`.
- The function returns `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`, where `end_pos` is `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns `None` if there is no match. The annotated version supports this assessment, as it describes the correct state of the program variables before and after the `if` block is executed.

The key point to consider is how the end position is calculated. Although `end_pos` is one position to the right of the actual end of the substring, the unit tests suggest that this is the expected behavior. If the problem description explicitly stated that the end position should be the actual end of the substring, the function would be incorrect. However, based on the provided information, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
