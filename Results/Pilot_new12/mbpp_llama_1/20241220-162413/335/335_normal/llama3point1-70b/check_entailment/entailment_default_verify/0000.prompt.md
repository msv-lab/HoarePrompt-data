You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly identify the occurrence and position of a given substring within a string. It uses the built-in `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. If the substring is not found, it returns `None` as specified in the problem description.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the function's correctness:

- Finding a substring that exists in the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "World")` returns `('World', 7, 11)`.
- Finding a substring that does not exist in the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "Python")` returns `None`.
- Finding a substring at the beginning of the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "Hello")` returns `('Hello', 0, 4)`.
- Finding a substring at the end of the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "World!")` returns `('World!', 7, 12)`.

The function handles edge cases, such as an empty string or a substring that is longer than the string itself, correctly by returning `None` when the substring is not found.

Overall, based on the examples and edge cases considered, the function appears to work as expected according to the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or a tuple containing the `substring`, the index of its first occurrence in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. The function performs a search operation to find the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and if found, it calculates and returns the start and end indices of the match. The function handles edge cases where `substring` is not present in `string` by returning `None`, but it does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings, which may be considered edge cases depending on the context in which the function is used. Additionally, the function does not account for overlapping matches or multiple occurrences of `substring` in `string`, it only reports the first occurrence. The state of the input variables `string` and `substring` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
