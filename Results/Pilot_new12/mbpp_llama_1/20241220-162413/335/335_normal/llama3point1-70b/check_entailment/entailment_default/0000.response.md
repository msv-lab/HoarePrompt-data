Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start index, and its end index. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

The function correctly handles the main case where the substring is present in the string, returning the expected tuple with the substring and its indices. It also correctly handles the case where the substring is not present in the string, returning `None`.

Additionally, the function seems to correctly handle edge cases such as when `substring` is not present in `string`, by returning `None`. Although the function does not handle empty strings as inputs for `string` or `substring`, according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, empty strings as inputs are not considered in this context.

Furthermore, the function is only required to find the first occurrence of the substring. The lack of support for overlapping matches or multiple occurrences is not considered an error because it aligns with the basic requirement of finding "the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string" and does not explicitly demand handling of all possible occurrences.

Therefore, given the assumptions about valid inputs and the basic requirements outlined in the problem description, the code appears to correctly fulfill its intended purpose.
