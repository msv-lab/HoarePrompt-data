You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly identify the occurrence and position of a given substring within a string. It uses the built-in `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. If the substring is not found, it returns `None` as specified in the problem description.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the function's correctness:

- Finding a substring that exists in the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "World")` returns `('World', 7, 11)`.
- Finding a substring that does not exist in the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "Python")` returns `None`.
- Finding a substring at the beginning of the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "Hello")` returns `('Hello', 0, 4)`.
- Finding a substring at the end of the string: `func_1("Hello, World!", "World!")` returns `('World!', 7, 12)`.

The function handles edge cases, such as an empty string or a substring that is longer than the string itself, correctly by returning `None` when the substring is not found.

Overall, based on the examples and edge cases considered, the function appears to work as expected according to the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` is found in `string`
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #The program returns substring that is a string, the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, and the index of the last character of the first occurrence of substring in string


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
