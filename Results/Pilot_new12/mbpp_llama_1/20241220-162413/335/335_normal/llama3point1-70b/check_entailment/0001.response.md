Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as input. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None` as per the problem description.

If the `substring` is found, the function calculates the end position by adding the length of the `substring` to the start position and returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its start position, and its end position (exclusive of the last character of the substring due to how Python handles indexing). 

Upon examination, the function seems to correctly handle all potential cases:

1. **Substring found:** Returns the correct start and end positions.
2. **Substring not found:** Returns `None`.
3. **Empty string:** If either the string or the substring is empty, Python's `find` method will behave correctly (e.g., finding an empty substring at position 0).
4. **Substring is a single character:** Correctly identifies its position.

Since the function appears to work as intended for all scenarios described in the problem, and considering Python's indexing rules where the end position in a range is exclusive, the code seems to be correct.
