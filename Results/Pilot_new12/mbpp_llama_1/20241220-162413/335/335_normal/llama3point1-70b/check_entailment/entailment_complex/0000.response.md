Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or a tuple containing the `substring`, the index of its first occurrence in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The function uses the `find` method to search for the `substring` in the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.

2. If the `substring` is found, the function calculates the start and end indices of the match. The start index is the index returned by `find`, and the end index is calculated by adding the length of the `substring` to the start index and subtracting 1 (to get the index of the last character).

3. The function returns the `substring`, the start index, and the end index as a tuple. This meets the requirement of returning the occurrence and position of the `substring` in the `string`.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to consider cases where the input is not a string or is an empty string. The function will work correctly for all valid inputs, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
