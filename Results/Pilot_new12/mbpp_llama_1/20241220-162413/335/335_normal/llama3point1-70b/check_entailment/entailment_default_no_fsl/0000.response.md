Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, but the provided code only finds the first occurrence of the substring and does not account for multiple occurrences or overlapping matches.

For example, if the input string is "hellohello" and the substring is "hello", the function should ideally return the positions of both occurrences of the substring, which are (0, 4) and (5, 9) respectively. However, the provided code only returns the position of the first occurrence, which is (0, 4).

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the substring is an empty string, which is a valid input. According to the problem description, the function should return None if there is no match, but in the case of an empty substring, the function will return incorrect results.

To fix this, the code should be modified to handle multiple occurrences, overlapping matches, and edge cases such as empty strings. One possible approach could be to use a loop to iteratively find all occurrences of the substring and store their positions in a list, which can then be returned by the function.
