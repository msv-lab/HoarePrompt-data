You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as input. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None` as per the problem description.

If the `substring` is found, the function calculates the end position by adding the length of the `substring` to the start position and returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its start position, and its end position (exclusive of the last character of the substring due to how Python handles indexing). 

Upon examination, the function seems to correctly handle all potential cases:

1. **Substring found:** Returns the correct start and end positions.
2. **Substring not found:** Returns `None`.
3. **Empty string:** If either the string or the substring is empty, Python's `find` method will behave correctly (e.g., finding an empty substring at position 0).
4. **Substring is a single character:** Correctly identifies its position.

Since the function appears to work as intended for all scenarios described in the problem, and considering Python's indexing rules where the end position in a range is exclusive, the code seems to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` is found in `string`
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #The program returns substring that is a string, the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, and the index of the last character of the first occurrence of substring in string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or a tuple containing the `substring`, the index of its first occurrence in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. The function performs a search operation to find the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and if found, it calculates and returns the start and end indices of the match. The function handles edge cases where `substring` is not present in `string` by returning `None`, but it does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings, which may be considered edge cases depending on the context in which the function is used. Additionally, the function does not account for overlapping matches or multiple occurrences of `substring` in `string`, it only reports the first occurrence. The state of the input variables `string` and `substring` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
