Based on the provided problem description, program, and output hints, I have analyzed the code's functionality. The original assessment concludes that the program is correct (Correctness: **True**), and I agree with this assessment.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as input, uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring`, and returns the correct start and end positions if found, or `None` if not found. The function handles most cases as intended:

1. **Substring found:** Returns the correct start and end positions.
2. **Substring not found:** Returns `None`.
3. **Empty string:** While the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings, it is essential to note that Python's `find` method behaves correctly in these scenarios. If the `substring` is an empty string, `find` returns 0, which is a valid index. If the `string` is empty, `find` returns -1, indicating that the `substring` is not found.
4. **Substring is a single character:** Correctly identifies its position.

The output hints provide additional context but do not necessarily contradict the original assessment. They mention that the function does not handle overlapping matches or multiple occurrences of `substring` in `string`, which is true. However, this does not imply that the program is incorrect, as the problem description only asks to find the occurrence and position of the substrings without explicitly requiring multiple occurrence handling or overlapping match reporting.

Moreover, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings. Nevertheless, as previously stated, Python's `find` method behaves correctly in these scenarios, and the program does not produce incorrect results due to this.

Based on the problem description, program, and output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description's requirements and handles most cases as intended.

Final: **True**
