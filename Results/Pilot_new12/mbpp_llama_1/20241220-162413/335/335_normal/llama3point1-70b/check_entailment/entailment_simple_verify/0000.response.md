To assess the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, let's analyze the original assessment, the problem description, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string, returning `None` if there is no match. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the `substring` to the starting index. If the `substring` is not found, it returns `None`.

The original assessment concludes that the function is correct based on several examples, including finding a substring that exists in the string, does not exist, starts at the beginning, and ends at the end of the string. It also mentions that the function handles edge cases correctly by returning `None` when the substring is not found.

The annotated version of the code reinforces the understanding of the function's behavior, clearly outlining the states before and after the `if` block is executed. Before the function call, `string` and `substring` are strings. After the `if` block, if the `substring` is found (`start` is not `-1`), the function proceeds to calculate the `end` index and returns the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the original assessment makes sense. The function correctly implements the requested functionality:
- It finds the first occurrence of the substring in the string.
- It returns the substring, its starting index, and its ending index (correctly calculated as `start + len(substring) - 1`, which gives the index of the last character of the substring).
- It returns `None` if the substring is not found.

The only potential point of contention could be the interpretation of "the position" in the problem description, but given the context and the annotated code, it seems clear that returning the start and end indices of the substring's first occurrence aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, considering the original assessment, the problem description, and the annotated version of the code, the function appears to correctly fulfill its intended purpose without any discrepancies or flaws based on the provided information and examples.

Final: **True**
