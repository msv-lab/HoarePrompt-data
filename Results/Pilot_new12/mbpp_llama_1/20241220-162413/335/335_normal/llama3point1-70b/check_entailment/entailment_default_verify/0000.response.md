Based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of a given substring within a string. It uses the built-in `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring, calculates the ending index, and returns the substring along with its start and end indices if found. If the substring is not found, it returns `None` as specified in the problem description.

The output hints further confirm the function's correctness by describing its behavior and specifying that it returns `None` if the substring is not found, and the expected output if the substring is found. The hints also mention that the function does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings, but since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, and assuming valid input, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

The original assessment correctly pointed out that the function handles edge cases, such as finding a substring that exists, does not exist, at the beginning, or at the end of the string. The examples provided demonstrate the function's correctness in these scenarios.

Therefore, the original assessment of **True** remains accurate because the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the given output hints.

Final: **True**
