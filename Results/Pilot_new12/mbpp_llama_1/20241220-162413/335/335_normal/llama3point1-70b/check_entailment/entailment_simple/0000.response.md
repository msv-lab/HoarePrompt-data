Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description requirements. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, which are expected to be strings. The function is designed to find the first occurrence and position of the `substring` within the `string`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. It uses the `find` method of the string to locate the first occurrence of the `substring`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`.
2. If the `substring` is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None` as per the problem description.
3. If the `substring` is found, it calculates the end index of the first occurrence by adding the length of the `substring` to the start index. The end index is then adjusted by subtracting 1 because string indices in Python are 0-based.
4. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `substring`, the start index of the first occurrence, and the end index of the first occurrence (adjusted to be inclusive of the last character in the substring).

The program handles the case when the `substring` is not found in the `string` by returning `None`, which aligns with the problem description. For all cases where the `substring` is found, it correctly identifies the first occurrence and its position within the `string`, also as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in all potential cases under the given assumptions about valid input.
