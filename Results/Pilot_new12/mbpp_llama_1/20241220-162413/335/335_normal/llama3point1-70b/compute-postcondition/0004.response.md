The code calculates the `end` index by adding the length of `substring` to the `start` index. The value of `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and it is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` is found in `string`. 

The `end` index is assigned the value `start + len(substring)`, which represents the index after the last character of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `end` is `start + len(substring)`, and `start` is not equal to -1.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `end` is `start + len(substring)`, and `start` is not equal to -1**
