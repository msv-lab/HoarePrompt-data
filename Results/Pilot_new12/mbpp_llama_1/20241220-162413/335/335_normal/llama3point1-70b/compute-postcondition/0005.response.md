The `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and is not equal to -1, and `end` is `start + len(substring)`. 
When we calculate `end - 1`, we get `start + len(substring) - 1`. 
The program returns `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`. 
Since `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `start` and `end - 1` represent the start and end indices of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, respectively, with `end - 1` being the index of the last character of the first occurrence of `substring`.

Output State: **The program returns substring that is a string, the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, and the index of the last character of the first occurrence of substring in string**
