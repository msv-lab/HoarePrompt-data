The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on certain conditions. 

Case 1: The function returns `None`. 

Case 2: The function returns the `substring` (which is a string), the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and the index of the last character of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. 

Since these cases are mutually exclusive, if one case is fulfilled, none of the others are. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and return either `None` or the `substring` along with its first occurrence index and the index of its last character in the `string`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters, string and substring, and returns either None or the substring along with its first occurrence index and the index of its last character in the string.**
