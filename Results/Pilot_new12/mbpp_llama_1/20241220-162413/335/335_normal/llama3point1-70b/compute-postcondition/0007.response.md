Functionality: **The function takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or a tuple containing the `substring`, the index of its first occurrence in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. The function performs a search operation to find the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and if found, it calculates and returns the start and end indices of the match. The function handles edge cases where `substring` is not present in `string` by returning `None`, but it does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty strings, which may be considered edge cases depending on the context in which the function is used. Additionally, the function does not account for overlapping matches or multiple occurrences of `substring` in `string`, it only reports the first occurrence. The state of the input variables `string` and `substring` remains unchanged after the function execution.**
