Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `num1` and `num2`, and returns `True` if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` results in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit (i.e., a power of 2), and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as when `num1` and `num2` are equal (resulting in `0`), when either `num1` or `num2` is `0`, and when the bitwise XOR operation yields a result that is not a power of 2. The function does not modify the input variables `num1` and `num2`, and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the bitwise XOR result is a power of 2 or not.**
