Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description requires the function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. However, the function checks whether the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` is a power of 2.

A correct function to solve the problem should count the number of '1' bits in the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` to determine whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. 

For example, if we input `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 3`, their bitwise XOR is `2`, which has only one '1' bit in its binary representation. However, this does not meet the condition of the function in the annotated program because `2` is indeed a power of 2, but the problem description is about differing at one bit position.

However, a correct implementation would also return `True` for the inputs `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 3` because `1` and `3` differ at two bit positions (not one). But `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 5` differ at just one bit position, and indeed their XOR `1` does have just one bit set to 1.

In other words, the function provided would return the correct result for some test cases (for example, `1` and `2`), but it's not based on the number of differing bits between `num1` and `num2`, but on the fact that `num1 ^ num2` is a power of 2.

To solve the problem described, we would use the same approach but verify that `num1 ^ num2` indeed has exactly one bit set, but that has to be true only if `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one position. The function in the provided code is actually correct in terms of implementation but incorrect in terms of problem description because it's considering the result of `num1 ^ num2` is a power of 2 (i.e., it has just one bit set in its binary representation), not that `num1` and `num2` have exactly one bit of difference between them.

To clarify, a more accurate description of the provided function would be that it checks if two numbers have exactly one bit of difference. But this requires understanding of bitwise operations.

An alternative implementation that would correctly solve the problem could look like this:
```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    # calculate the XOR of num1 and num2
    xor_result = num1 ^ num2
    # count the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of xor_result
    count = bin(xor_result).count('1')
    # return True if the count is 1, False otherwise
    return count == 1
```
This function would indeed return `True` if `num1` and `num2` differ at one bit position only, and `False` otherwise.
