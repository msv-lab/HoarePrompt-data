Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two integers `num1` and `num2` and checks whether their bitwise XOR operation results in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit. This is a correct implementation of the problem description, as the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the operands have different bits, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0. The `bin()` function converts the result to a binary string, and the `count('1')` method counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation.

The function correctly handles edge cases such as when `num1` and `num2` are equal (resulting in `0`), when either `num1` or `num2` is `0`, and when the bitwise XOR operation yields a result that is not a power of 2.

For example, if `num1 = 5` (binary: `101`) and `num2 = 3` (binary: `011`), the bitwise XOR operation results in `6` (binary: `110`), which has two '1' bits. Therefore, the function correctly returns `False`.

However, if `num1 = 5` (binary: `101`) and `num2 = 4` (binary: `100`), the bitwise XOR operation results in `1` (binary: `001`), which has one '1' bit. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True`.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases, and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the function is **True**.
