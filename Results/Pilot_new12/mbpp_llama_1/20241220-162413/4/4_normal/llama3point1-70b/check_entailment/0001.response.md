Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the binary representations of the two numbers. The XOR operation yields 1 for each position where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different.

The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of the XOR operation to a binary string. The `count('1')` method then counts the number of '1' bits in the binary string. If the count is 1, it means that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the two numbers are equal, the XOR operation yields 0, and the `count('1')` method returns 0, which is not equal to 1, so the function correctly returns False.
- If the two numbers differ at one bit position, the XOR operation yields a binary string with exactly one '1' bit, and the `count('1')` method returns 1, so the function correctly returns True.
- If the two numbers differ at more than one bit position, the XOR operation yields a binary string with more than one '1' bit, and the `count('1')` method returns a value greater than 1, so the function correctly returns False.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
