You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 is a power of 2, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `num1` and `num2`, and returns `True` if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` results in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit (i.e., a power of 2), and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as when `num1` and `num2` are equal (resulting in `0`), when either `num1` or `num2` is `0`, and when the bitwise XOR operation yields a result that is not a power of 2. The function does not modify the input variables `num1` and `num2`, and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the bitwise XOR result is a power of 2 or not.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
