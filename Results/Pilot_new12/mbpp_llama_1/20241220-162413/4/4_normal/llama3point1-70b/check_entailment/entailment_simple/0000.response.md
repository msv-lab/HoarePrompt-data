Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

- The problem description requires the function to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
- The function `func_1(num1, num2)` uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the binary representations of `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation returns a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in `num1` and `num2` are different.
- The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of the XOR operation to a binary string.
- The `count('1')` method is used to count the number of '1' bits in the binary string.
- If the count of '1' bits is 1, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ at only one bit position, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach is correct because the XOR operation and the subsequent count of '1' bits effectively identify whether the two input numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

The comment in the code mentions that the program returns `True` if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` is a power of 2, which is incorrect. However, the code itself does not implement this condition; it correctly checks for the count of '1' bits being 1.

To illustrate the correctness of the program, consider the following examples:
- If `num1 = 5` (binary 101) and `num2 = 3` (binary 011), the XOR result is 6 (binary 110), which has 2 '1' bits, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- If `num1 = 5` (binary 101) and `num2 = 4` (binary 100), the XOR result is 1 (binary 001), which has 1 '1' bit, so the function correctly returns `True`.
