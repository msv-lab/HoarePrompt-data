Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` to compare the bits of `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operator returns 1 for each bit position where the bits of `num1` and `num2` are different. The `bin()` function is then used to convert the result of the XOR operation to a binary string, and the `count('1')` method is used to count the number of '1' bits in this string.

If the two numbers differ at only one bit position, the XOR operation will result in a binary number with only one '1' bit, so the `count('1')` method will return 1, and the function will return `True`. If the two numbers differ at more or less than one bit position, the `count('1')` method will return a value other than 1, and the function will return `False`.

This solution handles all potential cases, including:

* When `num1` and `num2` have the same bit length.
* When `num1` and `num2` have different bit lengths.
* When `num1` and `num2` are both zero or both non-zero.
* When `num1` and `num2` are negative (since Python's bitwise operators work with the two's complement representation of negative numbers).

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
