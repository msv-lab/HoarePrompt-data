Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of 2. The function performs the XOR operation on `a` and `b`, checks if the result is non-zero and a power of 2 by verifying that it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation (achieved by checking if the result is non-zero and if the result bitwise AND the result minus one is zero), and returns `True` if these conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. The function handles all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`, including positive, negative, and zero values, and correctly determines the result based on their bitwise XOR operation, covering all potential edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are equal (resulting in a XOR of 0), when `a` or `b` is zero, and when the XOR result is a power of 2 or not.**
