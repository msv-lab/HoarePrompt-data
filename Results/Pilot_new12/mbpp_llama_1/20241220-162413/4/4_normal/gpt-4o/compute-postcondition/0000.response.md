The code calculates the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `xor_result`. The XOR operation compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. If the bits are the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

Given that `a` and `b` are integers, the value of `xor_result` will be an integer that represents the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `xor_result` is an integer equal to `a ^ b`**
