Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses bitwise operations to achieve this. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The `xor_result = a ^ b` line calculates the bitwise XOR of the two input numbers `a` and `b`. The XOR operation sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different.

2. The `return xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` line checks two conditions:
   - `xor_result!= 0`: This ensures that at least one bit is different between `a` and `b`. If `xor_result` were 0, it would mean that all bits are the same, so the function would return False.
   - `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This condition checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (which means it has exactly one bit set to 1). This works because subtracting 1 from a power of 2 will flip all bits up to the first 1 bit, and the bitwise AND operation will result in 0 if and only if `xor_result` is a power of 2.

The function will return True if and only if exactly one bit is different between `a` and `b`, which meets the problem description.

All the provided unit tests seem to be correct and cover different cases, such as numbers with different signs (not applicable in this case, since bitwise operations treat numbers as unsigned), numbers with the same sign, and edge cases like 1 and 5. 

No incorrect cases were found after analyzing the code, and it appears to handle all possible inputs correctly.
