To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we must analyze whether it accurately checks if two numbers differ at one bit position only.

The provided function, `func_1(a, b)`, uses bitwise operations to compare the two input integers `a` and `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b`: This line computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. The XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand (`a`) to the corresponding bit of the second operand (`b`). If the bits are the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. If the bits are different, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Therefore, the result of `a ^ b` will have bits set to 1 in positions where `a` and `b` differ.

2. `return xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This line checks two conditions:
   - `xor_result!= 0` ensures that `a` and `b` are not identical (since their XOR would be 0 if they were the same).
   - `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. In binary representation, powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to 1 (the bit in the place that corresponds to that power of 2), and all other bits set to 0. Subtracting 1 from a power of 2 gives a number that has all the bits to the right of the first 1 set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. Therefore, doing a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between a power of 2 and the number one less than it will always result in 0, because there are no bits that are 1 in both numbers. This condition is a common way to check if a number is a power of 2.

The combination of these conditions means that the function returns `True` if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of 2, indicating that `a` and `b` differ by exactly one bit. If the XOR is not a power of 2 (or is 0, meaning `a` and `b` are identical), the function returns `False`.

Given the problem description, the function is correct because it correctly identifies when two numbers differ by exactly one bit by checking if their XOR is a non-zero power of 2.

Correctness: **True**
