Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. This is achieved using bitwise operations. 

First, the function calculates the XOR of `a` and `b` using the `^` operator. The result of `a ^ b` will be a number that has bits set to 1 at positions where `a` and `b` have different bits.

Next, the function checks if the XOR result is not zero (`xor_result!= 0`). This is necessary because if `a` and `b` are the same numbers, their XOR will be zero, meaning they don't differ at all.

Finally, the function checks if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1. This is done using the expression `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This works because in binary representation, subtracting 1 from a number that has exactly one bit set to 1 will result in a number that has all bits to the right of the original bit set to 1 and the original bit set to 0. Therefore, performing a bitwise AND of the original number and the decremented number will result in zero if the original number had exactly one bit set to 1.

For example, if `xor_result` is 8 (binary 1000), then `xor_result - 1` will be 7 (binary 0111). The bitwise AND of 1000 and 0111 is 0000, which is zero.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. All the provided assertions pass, and the logic seems correct for any two numbers. The function correctly identifies whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
