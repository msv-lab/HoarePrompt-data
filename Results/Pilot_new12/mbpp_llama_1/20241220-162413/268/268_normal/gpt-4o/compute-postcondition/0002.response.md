The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix` and `n`. `matrix` is a list of lists where each inner list has at least n+1 elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum value from the list of nth elements of the inner lists in the matrix. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix which is a list of lists and a non-negative integer n, and returns the maximum nth element value among all the inner lists in the matrix.**
