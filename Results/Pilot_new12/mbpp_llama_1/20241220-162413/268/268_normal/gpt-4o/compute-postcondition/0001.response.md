The `nth_column` is a list that consists of the nth element from each inner list in the `matrix`. The `matrix` is a list of lists where each inner list has at least `n+1` elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer. 

The program returns the maximum value from the `nth_column`. 

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list of nth elements of the inner lists in the matrix, where n is a non-negative integer and each inner list has at least n+1 elements**
