Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It accepts a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer (n) as parameters and returns the maximum value of the nth element from each inner list in the matrix. The function assumes that each inner list in the matrix has at least n+1 elements, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

The function uses list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix and then uses the built-in max function to find the maximum value in that column. This approach is correct and efficient.

The function also handles cases where the matrix is empty or contains inner lists of varying lengths, as long as each inner list has at least n+1 elements. If the input matrix or n is invalid, the function will raise an exception, which is a reasonable behavior.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and edge cases.

Overall, the code provided correctly implements the function described in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, assuming valid input.
