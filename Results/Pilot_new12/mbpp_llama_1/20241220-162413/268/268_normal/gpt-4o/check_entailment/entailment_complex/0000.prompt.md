You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists where each inner list has at least n+1 elements, and n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list of nth elements of the inner lists in the matrix, where n is a non-negative integer and each inner list has at least n+1 elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer (n) as parameters, and returns the maximum value of the nth element from each inner list in the matrix. The function assumes that each inner list in the matrix has at least n+1 elements. If this assumption is not met, the function will raise an IndexError. The function does not modify the input matrix and only provides the maximum nth element value. It handles cases where the matrix is empty or contains inner lists of varying lengths, as long as each inner list has at least n+1 elements. The function will return the maximum value of the nth column, or raise an exception if the input matrix or n is invalid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
