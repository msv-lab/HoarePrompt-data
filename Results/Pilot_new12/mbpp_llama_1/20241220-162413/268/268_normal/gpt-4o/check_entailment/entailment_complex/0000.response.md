Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the problem description. It is designed to find the maximum value of the nth column in a given matrix, where the matrix is represented as a list of lists and n is a non-negative integer. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a matrix and an integer n as parameters, which matches the problem description.

2. The line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` creates a list of the nth elements from each inner list in the matrix. This is exactly what the problem description asks for: to return the max of the n'th column.

3. The line `return max(nth_column)` then returns the maximum value from this list of nth elements, which is the desired result.

Given the assumptions that the input matrix is valid (i.e., it's a list of lists where each inner list has at least n+1 elements, and n is a non-negative integer), the function will always work correctly and produce the expected result. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, further confirming that it meets the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
