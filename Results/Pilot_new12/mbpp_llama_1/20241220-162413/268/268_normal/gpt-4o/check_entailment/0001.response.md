Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and it returns the maximum value of the `n`-th column.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` effectively extracts the `n`-th column from the input matrix.
2. The built-in `max` function then finds the maximum value in this extracted column.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs. Additionally, the code handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input matrix is empty (although this is not explicitly tested) or when `n` is a valid column index.

To thoroughly verify the correctness, let's consider some potential edge cases:

* Empty matrix: Although not explicitly tested, the function would raise an `IndexError` if the input matrix is empty, since it tries to access the `n`-th element of each row.
* Out-of-range column index: If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, the function would raise an `IndexError`.
* Non-integer column index: If `n` is not an integer, the function would raise a `TypeError`.

However, these edge cases are not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, so it's reasonable to assume that the input is valid. Therefore, based on the provided information and the code's implementation, the program is correct.
