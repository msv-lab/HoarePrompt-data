Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the maximum value in the nth column of a given matrix. The function uses list comprehension to extract the nth column from the matrix and then returns the maximum value in this column. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the maximum value of the nth element from each inner list in the matrix, handles cases where the matrix is empty or contains inner lists of varying lengths, and raises an exception if the input matrix or n is invalid.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function, as they all pass with the expected results. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases that the function must handle, and we assume that the input will be valid, the function can be considered correct.

The function works as follows:

- It takes a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer (n) as parameters.
- It extracts the nth column from the matrix using list comprehension.
- It returns the maximum value in the nth column.

The function handles the given examples correctly:

- `func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)` returns `19`, which is the maximum value in the 2nd column.
- `func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1)` returns `10`, which is the maximum value in the 1st column.
- `func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1)` returns `11`, which is the maximum value in the 1st column.

Based on this analysis, the function can be considered correct, as it behaves as expected for the given examples and aligns with the problem description and output hints.
