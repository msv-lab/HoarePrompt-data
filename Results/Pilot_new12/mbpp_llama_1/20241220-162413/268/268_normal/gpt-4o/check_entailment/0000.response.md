Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding the maximum value in the n-th column of a given matrix. 

The function uses list comprehension to extract the n-th column from the matrix and then returns the maximum value from this column using the built-in `max` function.

This solution works correctly for all potential cases because:

1. It correctly handles the case when the matrix is empty or when the column index `n` is out of range (this case is not explicitly handled but would result in an `IndexError` in Python, which is the expected behavior for an invalid input).

2. The `max` function correctly finds the maximum value in a list of numbers, including the case when there are multiple maximum values (it returns one of them).

3. The function does not modify the original matrix, as required by the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs.

Therefore, the given function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
