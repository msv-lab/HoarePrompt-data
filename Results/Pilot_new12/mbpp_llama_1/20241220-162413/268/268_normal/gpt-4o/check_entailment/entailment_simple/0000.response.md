Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and it returns the maximum value of the `n`-th column.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` extracts the `n`-th element from each inner list (or row) in the matrix.
2. The `max` function is then applied to this list of `n`-th elements, which returns the maximum value.

The program assumes that the input is valid, meaning that the matrix is a list of lists where each inner list has at least `n+1` elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Under these conditions, the program will always return the correct maximum value of the `n`-th column.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as they cover different scenarios and verify that the function returns the expected results. Therefore, the program accurately implements the problem description.
