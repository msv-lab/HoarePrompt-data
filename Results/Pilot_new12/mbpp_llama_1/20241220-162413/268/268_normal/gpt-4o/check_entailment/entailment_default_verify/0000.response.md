The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided code. The problem description requires a function to return the maximum value of the n-th column in a given matrix, and the provided code correctly implements this functionality. 

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a matrix and a column index `n` as parameters. It uses list comprehension to extract the n-th column from the matrix and then returns the maximum value from this column using the built-in `max` function. 

The output hints provided are consistent with the problem description and the code. They describe the function's behavior and the assumptions it makes about the input, which align with the correct implementation of the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate. The code correctly implements the problem description, and the output hints support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
