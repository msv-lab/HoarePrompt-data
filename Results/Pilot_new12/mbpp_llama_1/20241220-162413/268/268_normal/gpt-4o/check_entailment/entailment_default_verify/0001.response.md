Based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I have evaluated the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the program is correct because it accurately implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and it returns the maximum value of the `n`-th column.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer (n) as parameters and returns the maximum value of the nth element from each inner list in the matrix. The output hints also mention that the function assumes that each inner list in the matrix has at least n+1 elements and that it does not modify the input matrix.

The code provided implements the function `func_1` which uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the input matrix and then finds the maximum value in this extracted column using the built-in `max` function.

Given that the output hints and the code provided match the problem description, and considering that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
