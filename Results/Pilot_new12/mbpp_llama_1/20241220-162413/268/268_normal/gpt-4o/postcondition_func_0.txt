The function accepts a 2D list (matrix) and a non-negative integer (n) as parameters, and returns the maximum value of the nth element from each inner list in the matrix. The function assumes that each inner list in the matrix has at least n+1 elements. If this assumption is not met, the function will raise an IndexError. The function does not modify the input matrix and only provides the maximum nth element value. It handles cases where the matrix is empty or contains inner lists of varying lengths, as long as each inner list has at least n+1 elements. The function will return the maximum value of the nth column, or raise an exception if the input matrix or n is invalid.
