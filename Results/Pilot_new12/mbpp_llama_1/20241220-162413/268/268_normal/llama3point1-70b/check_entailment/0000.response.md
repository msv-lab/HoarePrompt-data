Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle the case when the input matrix is empty or when the column index `n` is out of range. 

For example, if the input matrix is `[]` and `n` is `1`, the program will throw an error because it tries to access the first row of the matrix (`row[n - 1] for row in matrix`), but the matrix is empty. 

Similarly, if the input matrix is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n` is `3`, the program will throw an error because the column index `n` is out of range. The matrix only has two columns, but the program tries to access the third column.

To fix this, the program should add error checking to handle these edge cases. 

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    if not matrix:
        raise ValueError("Matrix is empty")
    if n < 1 or n > len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("Column index out of range")
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```
