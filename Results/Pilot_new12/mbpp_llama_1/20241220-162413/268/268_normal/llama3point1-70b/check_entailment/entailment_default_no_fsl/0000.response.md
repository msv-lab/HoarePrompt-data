Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to write a function that returns the max of the n'th column in a given matrix. However, the provided code does not handle the case when `n` equals the number of columns in `matrix`. In this case, the function will raise an "IndexError" exception because `n-1` will be out of range. 

Additionally, the function also assumes that the input `matrix` is not empty and all rows have the same number of columns. If the input `matrix` is empty or rows have different numbers of columns, the function may raise exceptions or return incorrect results.

For example, if the input matrix is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` and `n` is 3, the function will raise an "IndexError" exception because `n-1` will be out of range. The function should either handle this case or explicitly state that `n` must be less than the number of columns in `matrix`. 

The function should also include error checking to handle cases where the input `matrix` is empty or rows have different numbers of columns. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
