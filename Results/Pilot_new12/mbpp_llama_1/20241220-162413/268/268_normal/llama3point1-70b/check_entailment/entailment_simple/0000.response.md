Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the function as described in the problem description. The issue lies in the indexing of the column. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value in the nth column of the matrix. However, in the provided code, the function returns the maximum value in the column at index `n-1` instead of `n`. This means that if `n` is the index of the column, the function will return the maximum value from the column before the one intended.

For example, if the matrix is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` and `n` is 0, the function should return the maximum value in the 0th column, which is `max([1, 4]) = 4`. However, the provided code will return `max([3, 6]) = 6`, which is the maximum value in the last column.

If the function were to be corrected, it should be modified to return `max(row[n] for row in matrix)`, which would correctly return the maximum value in the nth column of the matrix. 

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```
