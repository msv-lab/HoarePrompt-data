The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to return the maximum value of the `n`-th column in a given matrix, and it correctly accomplishes this task using a generator expression and the built-in `max` function.

However, upon closer examination of the annotated version of the code, it becomes apparent that there is an inconsistency in the problem description and the code. The problem description states that the function should return the maximum value of the `n`-th column, but the annotated code indicates that the function returns the maximum value in the column at index `n-1`. This discrepancy arises because the Python list indexing is 0-based, which means that the first element is at index 0.

In the annotated code, it is mentioned that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, and the function returns the maximum value in the column at index `n-1`. However, if `n` is 0, the function will attempt to access the element at index `-1`, which refers to the last element in the list. This is not consistent with the problem description, which expects the function to return the maximum value of the `n`-th column, not the `(n-1)`-th column or the last column.

Considering this, the original assessment should be changed because the function does not accurately meet the problem description. The function is designed to return the maximum value of the `(n-1)`-th column, not the `n`-th column.

Final: **False**
