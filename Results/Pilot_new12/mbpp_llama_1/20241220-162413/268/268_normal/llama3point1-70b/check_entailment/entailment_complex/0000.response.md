Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the max of the n'th column. However, in the annotated program, it returns the maximum value in the column at index `n-1`, not `n`. This means that if `n` is equal to the column index, the function will return the maximum value from the previous column, not the nth column.

For example, if `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` and `n = 1`, the function should return `5` (the maximum value in the first column), but the program will return `6` (the maximum value in the column at index `0`, which is the last column because `n-1 = 0`).

To fix this issue, the program should return `max(row[n] for row in matrix)` instead of `max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)`. This will ensure that the function returns the maximum value in the nth column as required by the problem description. 

Additionally, the function note that returns the maximum value in the last column when `n` is `0` is not in line with the problem statement which wants the nth column max. The statement in the annotated program describing what the function does when `n` is `0` should be ignored, as this was an error on the part of the program's writer.
