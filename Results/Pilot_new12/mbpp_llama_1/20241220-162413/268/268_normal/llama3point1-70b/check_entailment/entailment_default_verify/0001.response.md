Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **True**, assuming that the input matrix is well-formed and the column index is valid. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix.

The output hints provide additional information about the program's behavior, including the handling of non-negative integer input `n` and the assumption that the input matrix is not empty and has rows with the same number of columns. The hints also note that if `n` equals the number of columns in `matrix`, the function will raise an "IndexError" exception, which is consistent with the original code.

However, upon closer examination, I notice that the output hints mention that if `n` is 0, the function returns the maximum value in the last column. This behavior is not consistent with the problem description, which asks for the maximum value in the `n`-th column. In the provided code, if `n` is 0, `row[n - 1]` will attempt to access `row[-1]`, which is the last element of the row, not the `n`-th column.

Therefore, based on the output hints and the problem description, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 0, which is an important edge case.

Final: **False**
