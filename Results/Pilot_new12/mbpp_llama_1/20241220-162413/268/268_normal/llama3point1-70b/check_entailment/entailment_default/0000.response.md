Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case when `n` equals the number of columns in `matrix`, as mentioned in the output hints. According to the problem description, the function should return the max of the n'th column, but if `n` equals the number of columns in `matrix`, the function will raise an "IndexError" exception because `n-1` will be out of range.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 0, as specified in the output hints. If `n` is 0, the function will attempt to access the last column of the matrix by using `n-1` as the index, which will be -1, which will indeed return the last column but the description does not explicitly states what should happen in this case. However the main issue here is the case where n is equal to the number of columns.

To fix this, the function could check if `n` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix` and handle it accordingly, for example by returning an error message or by using a different indexing method. 

For example, a correct version of the function could be:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    if n > len(matrix[0]):
        raise ValueError("n is out of range")
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```
This function checks if `n` is within the valid range of column indices for the matrix, and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. This ensures that the function does not attempt to access an index that is out of range, preventing the "IndexError" exception.
