#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the column at index n-1 of the 2D list 'matrix', where 'n' is a non-negative integer less than the number of columns in 'matrix'. If n is 0, it returns the maximum value in the last column.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value in the column at index `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, it returns the maximum value in the last column. The function handles cases where `n` is a non-negative integer less than the number of columns in `matrix`, and it does not modify the input `matrix`. Note that if `n` equals the number of columns in `matrix`, the function will raise an "IndexError" exception because `n-1` will be out of range. The function also assumes that the input `matrix` is not empty and all rows have the same number of columns. If the input `matrix` is empty or rows have different numbers of columns, the function may raise exceptions or return incorrect results.
