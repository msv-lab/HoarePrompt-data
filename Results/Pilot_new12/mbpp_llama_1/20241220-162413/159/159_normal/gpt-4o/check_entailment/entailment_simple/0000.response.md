Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a function named `func_1` that takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone. The formula used to calculate the volume, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem description of finding the volume of a cone.

The program includes assertions to test its correctness with different sets of inputs, which helps verify that it behaves as expected. Given the problem description, the assumption that inputs will always be valid (non-negative numbers for `radius` and `height`), and the mathematical correctness of the formula used, the program does exactly what the problem description asks for: it calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height.

The formula for the volume of a cone, `V = 1/3 * π * r^2 * h`, where `V` is the volume, `π` (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, `r` is the radius of the base of the cone, and `h` is the height of the cone, is correctly implemented in the function as `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. This ensures that for every potential case where valid inputs (non-negative numbers) are provided, the program will correctly calculate and return the volume of the cone as per the problem description.
