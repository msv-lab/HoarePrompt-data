The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, stating that the formula used in the function `func_1` is the standard formula for the volume of a cone, which is consistent with the problem description. This assessment makes sense based on the provided code and problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, stating that the input to the function `func_1` is non-negative numbers for radius and height, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. The annotated code also correctly describes the formula used to calculate the volume of a cone.

Upon reviewing the code, annotations, and problem description, I agree with the original assessment. The program accurately implements the formula to find the volume of a cone, and the test cases provided verify the correctness of the function for different input values.

The annotations support the correctness of the program by confirming that the input values are valid and that the formula used is correct. The program correctly returns the volume of a cone using the standard formula, which is `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
