Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are input parameters. The function accepts two parameters, which are expected to be non-negative numbers, and returns their corresponding cone volume. 

The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, so the lack of input validation does not affect the correctness of the program. The code will produce the correct result for valid inputs, which are non-negative numbers. 

The provided unit tests also seem to validate this, with the function being tested for different inputs and the results matching the expected values. 

Therefore, assuming the input will always be valid, the program meets the requirements in the problem description and correctly calculates the volume of a cone for every potential case.
