You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is the standard formula for the volume of a cone, which is consistent with the problem description.

The program also includes several assertions to test the function with different input values. These assertions verify that the function returns the correct volume for each of the provided cases, within a small tolerance (`rel_tol=0.001`) to account for floating-point precision errors.

After analyzing the code and the provided test cases, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly calculates the volume of a cone for the provided input values, and the formula used is mathematically correct.

Therefore, based on the provided code and test cases, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases, and it accurately implements the formula to find the volume of a cone.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are input parameters. The function accepts two non-negative numbers, radius and height, and returns their corresponding cone volume. If the inputs are valid (i.e., non-negative numbers), the function will return the correct volume. However, if the inputs are negative or not numbers, the function may raise an error or produce an incorrect result, as it lacks input validation. Additionally, if the radius or height is zero, the function will return a volume of zero, which is a valid result. The function does not modify the input parameters and only returns the calculated volume, without any side effects.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
