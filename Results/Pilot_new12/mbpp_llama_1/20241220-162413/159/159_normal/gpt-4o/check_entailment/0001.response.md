Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is the standard formula for the volume of a cone, which is consistent with the problem description.

The program also includes several assertions to test the function with different input values. These assertions verify that the function returns the correct volume for each of the provided cases, within a small tolerance (`rel_tol=0.001`) to account for floating-point precision errors.

After analyzing the code and the provided test cases, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly calculates the volume of a cone for the provided input values, and the formula used is mathematically correct.

Therefore, based on the provided code and test cases, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases, and it accurately implements the formula to find the volume of a cone.
