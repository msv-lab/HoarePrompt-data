The program returns the result of the calculation `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. Here, `math.pi` is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, `radius` is a non-negative number, and `height` is also a non-negative number. 

The calculation `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height` is the formula for the volume of a cone, where `radius` is the radius of the base of the cone and `height` is the height of the cone.

Output State: **The program returns the volume of a cone, which is 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative numbers**
