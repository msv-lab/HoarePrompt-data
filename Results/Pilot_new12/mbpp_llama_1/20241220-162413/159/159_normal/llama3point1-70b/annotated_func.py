#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers, representing the volume of a cylinder.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder, given non-negative real numbers for radius and height, using the formula 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height. It accepts two parameters, radius and height, and returns a single value representing the volume. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the provided radius and height are non-negative real numbers. If the inputs are not valid (e.g., negative numbers, non-numeric values), the function may produce incorrect or undefined results. The function does not modify the input variables and only returns the calculated volume, leaving the original state of the program unchanged except for the returned value.
