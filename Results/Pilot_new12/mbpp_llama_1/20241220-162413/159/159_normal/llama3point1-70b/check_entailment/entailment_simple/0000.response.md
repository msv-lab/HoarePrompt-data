To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to compare its functionality with the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the volume of a cone, while the provided program calculates the volume of a cylinder.

The formula for the volume of a cone is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

The provided Python function `func_1(radius, height)` returns `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, which indeed matches the formula for the volume of a cone, not a cylinder as mentioned in the comment. The comment in the code incorrectly states that it calculates the volume of a cylinder, but the formula implemented is actually correct for a cone.

Given the formula is correct for calculating the volume of a cone and the problem description asks for the volume of a cone, despite the misleading comment, the function does what the problem description requires.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **True**
