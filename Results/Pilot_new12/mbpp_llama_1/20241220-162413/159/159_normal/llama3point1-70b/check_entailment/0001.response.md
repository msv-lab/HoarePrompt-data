Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, is the standard formula for the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

To verify the correctness of this program, let's consider various potential cases:

1. **Positive Radius and Height**: For any positive values of radius and height, the function should return a positive volume, which it does, as the formula involves squaring the radius (which ensures a positive result) and multiplying by the height and \( \pi \), all of which are positive.

2. **Zero Radius**: If the radius is 0, the function should return 0, as a cone with zero radius has no volume. Plugging in 0 for the radius in the formula results in 0, which is correct.

3. **Zero Height**: If the height is 0, the function should return 0, as a cone with zero height has no volume. Plugging in 0 for the height in the formula also results in 0, which is correct.

4. **Negative Radius or Height**: The formula itself does not handle negative input values explicitly. However, in the context of calculating the volume of a cone, negative radius or height does not make physical sense. The mathematically correct result for negative input would be a negative volume due to the multiplication of negative values, but this would be an incorrect result in the context of the problem description, which seeks a volume (a non-negative quantity). However, since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle negative inputs, and given that the mathematical formula does not change based on the sign of the inputs, one could argue that the function behaves as expected for all real numbers, even though negative inputs are not physically meaningful.

Given these considerations, the program appears to correctly implement the formula for the volume of a cone for all cases where the inputs make physical sense (i.e., positive radius and height). Therefore, based on the provided problem description and assuming the intent is to calculate volume for meaningful, non-negative inputs, the program is correct.
