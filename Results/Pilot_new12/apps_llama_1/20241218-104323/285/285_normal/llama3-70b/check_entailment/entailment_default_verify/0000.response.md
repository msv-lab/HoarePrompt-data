The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **True**. After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that Kolya could buy. The use of integer division (`//`) to calculate the maximum number of houses, cars, and computers that Kolya can buy is also correct.

The output hints provide examples of the program's behavior and confirm that it works as expected. The hints also highlight the program's brute-force approach, which may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs, but is correct in terms of its logic and functionality.

One potential issue that could be raised is that the program does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 0. However, since the problem statement specifies that `n` is in the range `1 <= n <= 10^9`, this case is not relevant.

Another potential issue is that the program's brute-force approach could lead to performance issues for very large inputs. However, as mentioned earlier, the problem statement does not specify any efficiency requirements, and the program is correct in terms of its logic and functionality.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
