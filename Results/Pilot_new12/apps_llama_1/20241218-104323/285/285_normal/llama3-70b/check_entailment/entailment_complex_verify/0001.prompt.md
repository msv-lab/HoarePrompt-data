You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers to see if the total cost equals the initial game-coin score `n`. 

Here's why the program works:

- It iterates over all possible numbers of houses (`a`) that can be bought, which is limited by the total number of coins divided by the cost of a house.
- For each number of houses, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought, which is limited by the remaining number of coins after buying houses.
- For each combination of houses and cars, it calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that can be bought with the remaining coins.
- If the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals the initial score `n`, it prints 'YES' and exits.
- If it checks all possible combinations and doesn't find a match, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and covers all possible cases. It doesn't assume any specific relationship between the costs of houses, cars, and computers, and it checks all possible combinations of purchases. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `a` is either `n // 1234567` if the loop completes all iterations without finding a solution or the value of `a` when the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is satisfied if the program exits, `b` and `c` are defined and hold values corresponding to `a` if the program exits, or not defined if the loop completes without finding a solution.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input and attempts to find a combination of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `n` can be expressed as `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`. If such a combination is found, the function immediately prints 'YES' and exits. If no combination is found after iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b`, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. After execution, the program's state will be one of two possible outcomes: either 'YES' will have been printed if a suitable combination was found, or 'NO' will have been printed if no combination was found. Note that the function's input range is limited by the annotation to 1 <= n <= 10^9, but this is not explicitly enforced by the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
