Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It attempts to find a combination of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that the input number `n` can be expressed as `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`. 

The code uses nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b`, and for each pair, it calculates the corresponding value of `c`. If it finds a combination that satisfies the equation, it immediately prints 'YES' and exits. If no combination is found after iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b`, the function prints 'NO'.

The code handles all possible cases within the specified input range (1 <= n <= 10^9), and it correctly checks for the existence of a combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfies the given equation. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

The output hints agree with the code, and they help to understand the functionality of the code. The code does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, it seems that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
