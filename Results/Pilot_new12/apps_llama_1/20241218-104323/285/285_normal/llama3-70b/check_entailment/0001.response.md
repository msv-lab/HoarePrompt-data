Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers to see if the total cost equals the initial game-coin score `n`. 

Here's why the program works:

- It iterates over all possible numbers of houses (`a`) that can be bought, which is limited by the total number of coins divided by the cost of a house.
- For each number of houses, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought, which is limited by the remaining number of coins after buying houses.
- For each combination of houses and cars, it calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that can be bought with the remaining coins.
- If the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals the initial score `n`, it prints 'YES' and exits.
- If it checks all possible combinations and doesn't find a match, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and covers all possible cases. It doesn't assume any specific relationship between the costs of houses, cars, and computers, and it checks all possible combinations of purchases. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
