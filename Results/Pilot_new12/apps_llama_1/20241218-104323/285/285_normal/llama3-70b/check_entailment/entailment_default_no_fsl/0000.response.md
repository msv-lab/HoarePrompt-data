Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and should work as expected for every potential case. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it's correct:

1. The code iterates over all possible values of `a` (number of houses) and `b` (number of cars) based on the input `n`. The loop for `a` iterates from 0 to `n // 1234567` (integer division), and for each `a`, the loop for `b` iterates from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`. This ensures that the remaining amount after buying houses and cars is sufficient to buy `b` cars.

2. For each combination of `a` and `b`, the code calculates the number of computers `c` that can be bought with the remaining amount.

3. The code checks if the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals the input `n`. If it does, the function prints 'YES' and exits.

4. If the function iterates over all possible combinations of `a` and `b` without finding a match, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend all of the initial `n` coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

The provided examples also support the correctness of the code:

- For the input 1359257, one possible solution is to buy one house, one car, and one computer, which costs 1,234,567 + 123,456 + 1,234 = 1,359,257 coins, matching the input. The code correctly prints 'YES' for this input.

- For the input 17851817, there is no combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to the input amount, and the code correctly prints 'NO'.

Given the code's logic and the provided examples, it seems that the code is correct and should work as expected for every potential case within the specified input range (1 <= n <= 10^9).
