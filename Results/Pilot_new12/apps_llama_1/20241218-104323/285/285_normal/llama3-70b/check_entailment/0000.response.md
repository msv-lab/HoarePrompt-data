Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program checks whether it's possible for Kolya to spend all of his initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates through all possible combinations of houses and cars that Kolya could buy, calculates the remaining amount of game-coins, and checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers.

The program uses integer division (//) to calculate the maximum number of houses, cars, and computers that Kolya can buy. It also checks if the total cost of the houses, cars, and computers equals the initial amount of game-coins.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the initial amount of game-coins is exactly divisible by the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.
* When the initial amount of game-coins is not exactly divisible by the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.
* When the initial amount of game-coins is 0.
* When the initial amount of game-coins is a large number.

The program also handles the case when Kolya buys no houses, cars, or computers.

Since the program checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, and it correctly calculates the remaining amount of game-coins and checks if it can be spent on computers, the program is correct.

It is also worth noting that the program uses a brute-force approach, which may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs. However, the problem statement does not specify any efficiency requirements, and the program is correct in terms of its logic and functionality.
