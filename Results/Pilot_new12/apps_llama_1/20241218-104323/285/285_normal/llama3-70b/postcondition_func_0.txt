The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input and attempts to find a combination of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `n` can be expressed as `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`. If such a combination is found, the function immediately prints 'YES' and exits. If no combination is found after iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b`, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. After execution, the program's state will be one of two possible outcomes: either 'YES' will have been printed if a suitable combination was found, or 'NO' will have been printed if no combination was found. Note that the function's input range is limited by the annotation to 1 <= n <= 10^9, but this is not explicitly enforced by the code.
