Postcondition: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 0`, `b` is 0, and `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, where `c` is a positive integer. The current value of `n` equals `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, which means `n` is a sum of `a` multiplied by `1234567`, `b` multiplied by `123456`, and `c` multiplied by `1234`, where `b` is 0, so the equation simplifies to `n` equals `a * 1234567 + c * 1234`.**
