To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we must analyze the code's impact on the program and consider the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`
- `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 0`
- `b` is 0
- `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`
- `n` equals `a * 1234567 + c * 1234`
- The string 'YES' has been printed

The code to be executed is:
```python
exit()
```

The `exit()` function in Python is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops execution entirely, and no further code is run.

Considering the initial state and the effect of `exit()`:
- The values of `a`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and the fact that 'YES' has been printed remain unchanged because `exit()` does not alter variable values; it simply stops the program.
- Since the program terminates, there's no further execution or modification of variables.

Thus, after executing `exit()`, the output state remains:
- `a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`
- `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 0`
- `b` is 0
- `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`
- `n` equals `a * 1234567 + c * 1234`
- The string 'YES' has been printed
- The program has terminated.

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 0`, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, `n` equals `a * 1234567 + c * 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has terminated.**
