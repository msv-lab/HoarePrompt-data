The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. 

The states of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before the `exit()` function. 

The value of `a` remains `n // 1234567 + 1`. 
The value of `n` is still greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 123456` and `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 >= 2`. 
The value of `b` is still 2. 
The value of `c` remains `(n - a * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234`. 
'YES' has been printed before the `exit()` function.

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 123456` and `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 >= 2`, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has been terminated**
