Postcondition: ***`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 0`, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, if `a * 1234567 + c * 1234 == n`, then 'YES' has been printed, and the program has terminated with `n` equal to `a * 1234567 + c * 1234`; otherwise, the program continues with its current state unchanged***
