The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution stops. 'YES' has been printed to the console before the program termination. 

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 123456`, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the program has been terminated.**
