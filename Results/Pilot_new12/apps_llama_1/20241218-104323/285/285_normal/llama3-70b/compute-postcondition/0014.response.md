To calculate the new value of `c`, we substitute the given values of `n`, `a`, and `b` into the equation.

Given:
- `n` is an integer greater than 123456
- `a` is 0
- `b` is 2

The equation for `c` is:
```python
c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
```

Substituting the values of `a` and `b`:
```python
c = (n - 0 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234
c = (n - 0 - 246912) // 1234
c = (n - 246912) // 1234
```

The initial value of `c` was `(n - 123456) // 1234`, but this has been updated according to the new equation.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not change. Only `c` is updated based on the given equation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, and `c` is `(n - 246912) // 1234`**
