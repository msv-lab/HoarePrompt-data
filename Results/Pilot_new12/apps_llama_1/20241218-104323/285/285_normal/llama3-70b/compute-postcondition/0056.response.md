The code snippet provided only contains a print statement, which does not affect the values of variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO' to the console. 

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the state of the variables remains the same. The value of `a` is still either `n // 1234567` if the loop completes all iterations without finding a solution, or it is not defined if the program was supposed to exit when the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is satisfied, but in this case, since 'NO' is printed, it implies that the loop completed without finding a solution. Hence, `a` equals `n // 1234567`, and `b` and `c` are not defined because the condition was not satisfied.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` equals `n // 1234567`, `b` and `c` are not defined, and 'NO' has been printed.**
