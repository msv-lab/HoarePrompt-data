The given code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. The program stops execution, and no further statements are executed.


Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, `b` is an integer and initially increased by 1, `c` is `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, `c` is a negative integer, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has exited**
