To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

1. **Given State**: 
   - `a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`
   - `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`
   - `b` and `c` are not defined

2. **Loop Statement**: 
   - `for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):`

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over a range that is determined by the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, this expression must yield a value greater than 0, since `range(0)` would not execute the loop body.
   - Given `a = n // 1234567 + 2`, let's substitute `a` in the loop's range expression:
     - `(n - (n // 1234567 + 2) * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`
   - Simplifying, we notice that `n // 1234567 * 1234567` equals `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by `1234567`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
     - `(n - (n - n % 1234567 + 2 * 1234567)) // 123456 + 1`
     - `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`
   - For the loop to execute, `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567)` must be greater than `-123456` to ensure the division by `123456` and then adding `1` results in a positive value.
   - Since `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, it implies `n % 1234567` could be any value from `0` to `1234566`. However, for the loop condition to hold, we specifically need the result of `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` to be at least `1`.
   - Given `b` is not defined before the loop, after the loop starts, `b` will be defined and take values starting from `0` up to the maximum value determined by the range expression.

4. **Adjusted State**:
   - `a` remains as `n // 1234567 + 2`
   - `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, ensuring that the loop can potentially execute since it influences the range of the loop
   - `b` is now defined within the loop's context and starts at `0`
   - `c` remains undefined as it's not used or defined within the given scope

**State: `a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, `b` starts at `0`, `c` is not defined**
