The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. 

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1, `c` is `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234` and is a negative integer, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated.**
