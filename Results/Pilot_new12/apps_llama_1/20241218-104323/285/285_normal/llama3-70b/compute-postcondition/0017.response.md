Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, and `c` is `(n - 246912) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed to the output, `c` is a negative integer, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the given values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
