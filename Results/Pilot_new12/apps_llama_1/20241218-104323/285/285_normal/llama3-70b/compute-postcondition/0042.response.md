The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops executing. 'YES' has been printed before the program exits.

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, `b` is an integer, `c` is `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, a negative integer, the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has exited**
