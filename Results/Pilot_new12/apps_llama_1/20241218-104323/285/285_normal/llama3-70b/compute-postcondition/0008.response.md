To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer that makes `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` greater than 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 0.
- `c` is `n // 1234`.

Given loop statement:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be 1.

The loop condition `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must still be greater than `b` for the loop to continue. Since `b` is now 1, this condition implies that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 1.

Given that `a` is 0, the condition simplifies to `(n) // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 1. This means `n // 123456` must be greater than 0, implying `n` must be greater than 0.

Other variables `a` and `c` do not change because their values depend on conditions outside the loop or are not updated within the loop based on the information provided. `c` is `n // 1234`, and since `n` does not change, `c` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `c` is `n // 1234`**
