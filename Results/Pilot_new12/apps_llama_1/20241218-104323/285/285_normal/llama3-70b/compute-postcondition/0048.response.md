Postcondition: ***`a` is `n // 1234567 + 2`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567 + 1)`, `b` is an integer and initially increased by 1, `c` is `(n % 1234567 - 2 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, and `c` is a negative integer. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the given values of `a`, `n`, `b`, and `c`.***
