The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. However, the given code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user.

Given this update, the previous constraint on `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9) is no longer guaranteed because the input could be any integer. The new value of `n` is directly dependent on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
