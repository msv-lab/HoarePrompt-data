Postcondition: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 123456`, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and the program has been terminated, otherwise, the program continues with the updated state.**
