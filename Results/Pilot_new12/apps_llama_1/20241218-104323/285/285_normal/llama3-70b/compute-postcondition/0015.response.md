The given code snippet is a simple print statement that prints 'YES'. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The initial state variables are: `n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, and `c` is `(n - 246912) // 1234`. 

The code does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, but it prints 'YES' to the output. The value of `c` can be calculated as `(n - 246912) // 1234`, but since `n` is greater than 123456, we can determine that `(n - 246912)` will be negative because 246912 is greater than 123456, and then it is divided by 1234. This means `c` will be a negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `c` is a negative integer equal to `(n - 246912) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed to the output.**
