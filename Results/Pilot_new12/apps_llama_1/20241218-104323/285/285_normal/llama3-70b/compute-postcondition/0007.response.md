Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that makes `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is `n // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then `n` equals `c * 1234`, `c` equals `n // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the initial conditions still applying: `n` is an integer that makes `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is `n // 1234`.***
