The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program in any way. The values of `a`, `n`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `n // 1234567 + 1`, `n` is greater than `1234567 * (n // 1234567)` and also satisfies `(n - a * 1234567) > 123456`, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
