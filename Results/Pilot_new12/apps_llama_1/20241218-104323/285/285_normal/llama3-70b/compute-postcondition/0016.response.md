The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, so no further code is executed after this point. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends. 'YES' has been printed to the output before the program ended. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 123456, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `c` is a negative integer equal to `(n - 246912) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed to the output, and the program has been terminated.
