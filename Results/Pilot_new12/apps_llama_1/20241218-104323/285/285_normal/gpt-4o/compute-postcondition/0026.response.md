To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 1.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `b` will range from 0 to `(n - 1234567) // 123456`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `(n - 1234567) - b * 123456`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` has a certain value. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Since `b` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `remaining_after_cars` is `(n - 1234567) - b * 123456`, and it is not perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`, this condition should still hold after incrementing `b`. Therefore, after incrementing `b` by 1, `remaining_after_cars` becomes `(n - 1234567) - (b + 1) * 123456`, and it should still not be perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is incremented by 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `(n - 1234567) - (b + 1) * 123456`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`**
