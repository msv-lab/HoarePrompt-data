To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`. This means the loop will execute based on the value of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`.

Given that:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `house_cost` is 1234567,
- `car_cost` is 123456,
- `computer_cost` is 1234,
- `a` is 0,
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute, it must be true that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0, since the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, and the loop will execute at least once if this condition is met. However, the critical factor here is not necessarily that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0 (since adding 1 ensures it's at least 1), but rather that `remaining_after_houses` is such that it allows for at least one iteration of the loop based on `car_cost`.

Thus, the state adjustments focus on ensuring that `remaining_after_houses` can facilitate the loop's execution. The initial state of `n` being between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `remaining_after_houses` being equal to `n`, already supports the potential for the loop to execute, as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` will always be at least 1 (due to the `+ 1`), ensuring the loop can run at least once.

However, to precisely define the state before the loop starts, considering the given conditions:
- `n`'s range does not directly impact the loop's ability to start, as long as `remaining_after_houses` allows for it.
- `house_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `a` are not directly relevant to the condition for the loop to start executing.
- `car_cost` is crucial in determining the number of iterations but not the ability to start the loop, given the `+ 1` in the range function.
- `remaining_after_houses` being equal to `n` implies its value must also be between 1 and 10^9, which inherently supports the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state, focusing on the variables directly relevant to the loop's execution, is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and is at least 0, `b` is 0**.

This adjustment includes `b` being 0, as it is the loop variable that will take on values starting from 0 in the range generated by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. The condition of `remaining_after_houses` being at least 0 is implicitly met given it equals `n`, which is a positive integer, ensuring the loop can indeed execute.
