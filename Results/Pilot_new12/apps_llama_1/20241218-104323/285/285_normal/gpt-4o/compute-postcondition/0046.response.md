According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. If `b` is less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` becomes 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456`**
