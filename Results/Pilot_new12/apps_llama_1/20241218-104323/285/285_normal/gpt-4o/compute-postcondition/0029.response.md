Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0. If `remaining_after_cars` is perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
