Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456`. If `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no value is returned.***
