The value of `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus `b * car_cost`. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `b` is 0, and the value of `car_cost` is 123456. 

So, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 0 * 123456`, which simplifies to `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and is at least 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and is at least 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `n`**
