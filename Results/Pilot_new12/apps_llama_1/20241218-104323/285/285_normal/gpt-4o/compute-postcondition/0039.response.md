Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, the initial value of `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567` and the initial value of `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, and `b` is 0. The current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, meaning the remainder when `remaining_after_cars` is divided by `computer_cost` is 0.**
