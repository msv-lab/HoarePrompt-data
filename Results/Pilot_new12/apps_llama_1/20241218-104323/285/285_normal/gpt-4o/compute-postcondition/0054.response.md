Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function checks if there exist non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that `n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, where `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, and `computer_cost` is 1234. If such integers `a` and `b` exist, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function's return value indicates whether the given budget `n` can be completely spent on houses, cars, and computers, with the specified costs, without any remaining balance. The function handles all possible cases for the input `n` and the specified costs, including edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, or where `n` is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.**
