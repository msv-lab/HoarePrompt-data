Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 2 * 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses` - 246912. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
