To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `house_cost` is 1234567,
- `car_cost` is 123456,
- `computer_cost` is 1234,
- `a` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
```

Given that `a` is 0, the expression `a * house_cost` evaluates to 0, regardless of the value of `house_cost`. Therefore, the variable `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n`, because `n - 0 = n`.

The states of `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `a` do not change. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `remaining_after_houses` which is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`**
