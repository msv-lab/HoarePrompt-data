Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, and `b` is 0. Additionally, `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0, meaning `remaining_after_cars` leaves a remainder when divided by `computer_cost`.**
