Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - b * 123456`, and if `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES', otherwise, there is no specified return value**
