To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is: `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 1.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0.

Since the loop iterates over `range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `b` has a certain value. For the loop to execute again, `b` should be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `b` will be incremented by 1.
- Since `remaining_after_houses` depends on `n` and `house_cost`, and these values are not changed by the loop counter `b`, `remaining_after_houses` remains `n - 1234567`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_after_houses` must be such that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than the current value of `b` plus one.

Given that `b` is incremented and the range depends on `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `remaining_after_houses` must allow for at least one more iteration of `b`. 

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time would reflect the increment of `b` and the condition that allows `b` to be within the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
