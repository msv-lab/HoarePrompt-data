To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 2 * 1234567
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 2
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567`
- `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567`
- `b` is 0
- `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0

Since the loop is controlled by the variable `b` and its range is determined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.

So, the new state of `b` would be `b + 1`, which means `b` is 1.

The values of `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, and `a` do not directly depend on the loop and remain unchanged.

`remaining_after_houses` and `remaining_after_cars` are expressions based on `n` and constants, and their values also do not change within the loop iterations as per the given information. However, the loop's ability to execute again does not directly depend on these variables but rather on `b` reaching the end of its defined range.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, considering `b` must increment:
State: **`n` is at least 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, and `b` is 1**
