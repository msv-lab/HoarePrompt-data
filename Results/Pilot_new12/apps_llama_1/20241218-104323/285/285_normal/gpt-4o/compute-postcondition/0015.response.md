The value of `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus `b` times `car_cost`. Since `b` is 2 and `car_cost` is 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses` - 2 * 123456, which is `remaining_after_houses` - 246912. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 2 * 123456, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses` - 246912**
