According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `n`. If `a` is less than `n // house_cost + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` if the loop executes, otherwise `b` is 0. 
For the loop to execute again `a` should be increased by 1. Therefore, `a` is 1. 
Now `remaining_after_houses` must be updated. `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`. 
So `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - 1 * house_cost`. 
`b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` if the loop executes, otherwise `b` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - house_cost`, `b` is `(n - house_cost) // car_cost + 1` if the loop executes, otherwise `b` is 0**
