Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, if `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES', otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `remaining_after_cars` being `remaining_after_houses - 123456` and `remaining_after_houses` being at least 0, allowing the loop to continue.**
