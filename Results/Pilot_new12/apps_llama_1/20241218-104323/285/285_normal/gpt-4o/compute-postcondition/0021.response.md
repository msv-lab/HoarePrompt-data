To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

- The loop is defined as `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):`. This implies that the loop will execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `n - house_cost`. For the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least 0, implying that `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0.
- Given that `house_cost` is 1234567 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), for `remaining_after_houses` to be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`.
- `b` is defined as `(n - house_cost) // car_cost + 1` if the loop executes, otherwise `b` is 0. However, the loop's execution is determined by the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, which directly relates to the value of `n`, `house_cost`, and `car_cost`.
- The initial state before the loop includes `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, `remaining_after_houses`, and the conditional value of `b`.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` to ensure `remaining_after_houses` is not negative.
- `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0 or more, considering the integer division.
- `b` will take on values from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` as it iterates through the range, starting from 0 because the range function in Python generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the stop value.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the conditions for the loop to execute, we adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` will range from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`**
