Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` will range from 0 to `(n - 1234567) // 123456`, `remaining_after_cars` is `(n - 1234567) - b * 123456`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not perfectly divisible by `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
