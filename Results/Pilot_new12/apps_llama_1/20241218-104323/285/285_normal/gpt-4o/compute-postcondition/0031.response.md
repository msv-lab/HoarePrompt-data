In the given code, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

We know `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and `b` is incremented by 1. 

So the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - b * 123456`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - b * 123456`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - b * 123456`**
