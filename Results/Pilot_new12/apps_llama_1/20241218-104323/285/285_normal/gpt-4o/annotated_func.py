    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, and either there exists an `a` and `b` such that `n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost` is a multiple of `computer_cost` (in which case the function returns 'YES'), or no such `a` and `b` exist within the given constraints.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that within the given constraints, there do not exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, and `computer_cost` is 1234.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function checks if there exist non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that `n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, where `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, and `computer_cost` is 1234. If such integers `a` and `b` exist, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function's return value indicates whether the given budget `n` can be completely spent on houses, cars, and computers, with the specified costs, without any remaining balance. The function handles all possible cases for the input `n` and the specified costs, including edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, or where `n` is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.
