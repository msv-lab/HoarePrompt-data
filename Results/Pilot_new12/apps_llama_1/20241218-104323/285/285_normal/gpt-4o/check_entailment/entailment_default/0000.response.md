Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided checks if it's possible to spend all the initial game-coins by buying houses, cars, and computers. It iterates over all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, and then checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. If it finds a combination where the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer cost, it returns 'YES'.

The code handles all possible cases for the input `n` and the specified costs, including edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, or where `n` is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. The code's return value indicates whether the given budget `n` can be completely spent on houses, cars, and computers, without any remaining balance.

The logic of the code is correct, and it should return the expected output for all valid inputs. It uses a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, and then checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. This approach ensures that it will find a solution if one exists.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
