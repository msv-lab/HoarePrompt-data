Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the described functionality. It checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers within the given budget 'n'. The function `func_1` iterates over all possible numbers of houses and cars that can be bought, and for each combination, it checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. If it finds a combination where the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer cost, it immediately returns 'YES'. If it checks all possible combinations without finding a valid one, it returns 'NO'.

The code handles all edge cases, including when 'n' is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, and when 'n' is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer. It also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description.

For example, given the input `1359257`, the code correctly returns 'YES' because one possible solution is to buy one house, one car, and one computer, spending `1234567 + 123456 + 1234 = 1359257` game-coins in total.

Similarly, given the input `17851817`, the code correctly returns 'NO' because there is no combination of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought to exactly spend `17851817` game-coins.

The code is efficient and correctly implements the described functionality, making it correct for every potential case.
