Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the solution to the problem described. The problem asks to determine if it's possible to spend all of an initial amount of game-coins (`n`) on houses, cars, and computers, where each item has a specific cost. The program checks all possible combinations of buying houses and cars, then checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It iterates over all possible numbers of houses that can be bought (`a` ranges from 0 to `n // house_cost`), which covers all possible scenarios of buying houses.
2. For each number of houses bought, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount (`b` ranges from 0 to `(n - a * house_cost) // car_cost`), which covers all possible scenarios of buying cars after buying houses.
3. For each combination of houses and cars bought, it checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers by checking if `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`. If it is, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to spend all of the initial amount on houses, cars, and computers.
4. If the program exhausts all possible combinations of buying houses and cars and finds no combination where the remaining amount can be spent on computers, it returns 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend all of the initial amount on houses, cars, and computers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. It checks all possible scenarios and returns the correct answer based on the problem's constraints.
