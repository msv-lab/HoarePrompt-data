You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I analyzed the given Python program and found it to be correct according to the problem description. The program is trying to determine whether it is possible to spend all the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers, given their respective costs.

The program uses a brute force approach, iterating over all possible combinations of houses and cars, and checking if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. The iteration is bounded by the remaining amount after buying houses and cars, which prevents unnecessary iterations.

The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remaining amount can be spent on computers is correct, as it checks if the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer's cost.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided examples seem to be handled correctly. The program returns "YES" when it is possible to spend all the initial game-coins, and "NO" otherwise.

Overall, the program seems to be correct, and it should handle all possible inputs according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function checks if there exist non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that `n - a * house_cost - b * car_cost` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, where `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, and `computer_cost` is 1234. If such integers `a` and `b` exist, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function's return value indicates whether the given budget `n` can be completely spent on houses, cars, and computers, with the specified costs, without any remaining balance. The function handles all possible cases for the input `n` and the specified costs, including edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, or where `n` is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
