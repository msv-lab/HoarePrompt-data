Correctness: **True**.

I analyzed the given Python program and found it to be correct according to the problem description. The program is trying to determine whether it is possible to spend all the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers, given their respective costs.

The program uses a brute force approach, iterating over all possible combinations of houses and cars, and checking if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. The iteration is bounded by the remaining amount after buying houses and cars, which prevents unnecessary iterations.

The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remaining amount can be spent on computers is correct, as it checks if the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer's cost.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided examples seem to be handled correctly. The program returns "YES" when it is possible to spend all the initial game-coins, and "NO" otherwise.

Overall, the program seems to be correct, and it should handle all possible inputs according to the problem description.
