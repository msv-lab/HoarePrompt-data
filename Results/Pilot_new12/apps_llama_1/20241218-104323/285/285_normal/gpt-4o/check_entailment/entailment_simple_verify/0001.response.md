Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment makes sense. The code correctly implements the required logic to determine if it's possible to spend all the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment, providing a clear step-by-step breakdown of the program's state and logic. The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought with the initial game-coins.

The key point in the code is the condition `if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:`, which checks if the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be exactly spent on computers. If this condition is met, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to spend all the initial game-coins. If the condition is not met for any combination of houses and cars, the program returns 'NO'.

The annotated version of the code also provides additional context and clarification on the program's state and logic, but it does not reveal any issues or inconsistencies with the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
