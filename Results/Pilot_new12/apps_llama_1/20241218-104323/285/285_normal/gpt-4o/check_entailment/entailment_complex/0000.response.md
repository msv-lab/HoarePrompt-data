Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem statement**: The problem asks if there exists a triple of non-negative integers a, b, and c such that a × 1,234,567 + b × 123,456 + c × 1,234 = n.
2. **Program implementation**: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it's possible to spend all of `n` on houses, cars, and computers with the specified costs.
3. **Loop structure**: The program uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b`. For each pair of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining amount after buying `a` houses and `b` cars.
4. **Modulus check**: The program checks if the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer cost (1,234) using the modulus operator (`%`). If it is, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to spend all of `n` on houses, cars, and computers.
5. **Return 'NO'**: If the program exhausts all possible combinations of `a` and `b` without finding a solution, it returns 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend all of `n` on houses, cars, and computers.

The program correctly implements the problem statement by checking all possible combinations of `a` and `b` and verifying if the remaining amount is a multiple of the computer cost. The loop structure and modulus check ensure that the program considers all possible solutions and returns the correct result.

In the given examples, the program correctly returns 'YES' for the input 1359257 and 'NO' for the input 17851817, which matches the expected output.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and returns the correct result for all possible inputs, making it correct.
