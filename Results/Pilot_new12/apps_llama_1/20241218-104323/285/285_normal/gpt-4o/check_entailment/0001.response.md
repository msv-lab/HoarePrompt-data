Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the required logic to determine if it's possible to spend all the initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's why:

- The program iterates over all possible numbers of houses that can be bought (`a` ranges from 0 to `n // house_cost`).
- For each number of houses bought, it then iterates over all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining coins (`b` ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`).
- For each combination of houses and cars, it checks if the remaining coins can be exactly spent on computers (i.e., `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`).
- If it finds any combination where the remaining coins can be exactly spent on computers, it immediately returns 'YES'.
- If it exhausts all possible combinations without finding a valid one, it returns 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the program checks all possible ways to spend the initial game-coins on houses, cars, and computers, and returns the correct answer according to the problem description.

The code is well-structured and properly handles all edge cases, including the case where `n` is 0 (in which case the function will return 'YES' because `a = b = c = 0` is a valid solution). 

Therefore, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
