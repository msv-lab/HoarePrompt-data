According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, and `decimal_value` is 0. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least 1 digit.

State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is 0, digit is the first digit in the list**
