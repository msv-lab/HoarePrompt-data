The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, and `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40. Additionally, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`. After executing the function body, the function returns the decimal value of the number represented by the `digits` in the list with the given `base`. If the list `digits` is empty, the function returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of digits and a base, and returns the decimal value of the number represented by the digits in the given base.**
