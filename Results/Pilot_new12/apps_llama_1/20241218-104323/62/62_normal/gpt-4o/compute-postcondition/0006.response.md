The value of `decimal_value` is updated to be the product of its current value and `base`, plus `digit`. The initial value of `decimal_value` is `digit * (base + 1)`. 

The new value of `decimal_value` is therefore `decimal_value * base + digit = (digit * (base + 1)) * base + digit = digit * (base^2 + base) + digit = digit * (base^2 + base + 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base^2 + base + 1)`, where `digit` is the third digit in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base^2 + base + 1)`, where `digit` is the third digit in the list.**
