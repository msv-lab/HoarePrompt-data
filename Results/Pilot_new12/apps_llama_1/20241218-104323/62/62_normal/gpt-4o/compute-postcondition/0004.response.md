The value of `decimal_value` is updated to be the product of its current value and `base`, plus the value of `digit`. Since `decimal_value` is initially equal to the second digit in the list and `digit` is also the second digit in the list, `decimal_value` is initially equal to `digit`. 

The new value of `decimal_value` is `decimal_value * base + digit`, which can also be written as `digit * base + digit`, since `decimal_value` is initially equal to `digit`. This simplifies to `digit * (base + 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)`, `digit` is the second digit in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)`, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
