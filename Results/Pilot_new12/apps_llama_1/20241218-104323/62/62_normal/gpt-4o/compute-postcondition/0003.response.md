To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 digit.
- `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40.
- All elements in `digits` are less than `base`.
- `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`.
- `digit` is the first digit in the list.

The loop statement is `for digit in digits:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `digits` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `digit` has been processed as the first digit in the list.
- For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more digit in the `digits` list.

Adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `digits` must have at least 2 digits because it has already processed the first digit.
- `base` remains the same since its value does not change based on the loop iteration (2 <= `base` <= 40).
- All elements in `digits`, including the new `digit` to be processed, are less than `base`.
- `decimal_value` will be updated to the next `digit` in the list, but we don't have its exact value. However, we know `decimal_value` is now equal to the second digit in the list.
- Since `digit` was the first digit, for the loop to execute again, `digit` must now be the second digit in the list.

State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are less than `base`, `decimal_value` is equal to the second digit in the list, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
