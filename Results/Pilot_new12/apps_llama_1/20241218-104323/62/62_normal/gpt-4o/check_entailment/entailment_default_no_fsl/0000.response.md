Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the comparison of two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the number of digits and the base for each number, then the digits themselves. It converts each number to its decimal equivalent using the `func_1` function and compares these decimal values to determine the output.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. It iterates through the digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit in each step. This process effectively converts the number from its given base to decimal.

The code handles the constraints specified in the problem description. It assumes the input is valid, as per the instructions, meaning that the bases are between 2 and 40, the digits are between 0 and the base minus one, and there are no leading zeroes in the input numbers. It does not include error checking for invalid inputs, which is acceptable based on the assumption of valid input.

The comparison logic at the end correctly determines whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number based on their decimal equivalents, and it prints the corresponding operator.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, both numbers are converted to decimal and found to be equal (47), leading to the output '='. In the second example, the numbers are correctly compared, resulting in '<' because 21 (in base 5) is less than 24 (in base 5). The third example also works as expected, comparing the two numbers and printing '>' because the number in base 16 (FF 4007 A) is larger than the number in base 9 (4803150).

Therefore, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
