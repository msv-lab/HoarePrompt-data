Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it does what it's supposed to do:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, splitting the lines into the number of digits and the base for each number, as well as the digits themselves.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The `func_1` function converts a list of digits in a given base to its equivalent decimal value. It does this by iterating through the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant), multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and then adding the current digit. This process is repeated for both numbers, X and Y.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the correct output based on whether X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y.

The program handles the conversion and comparison correctly because it:

- Uses the correct formula for converting a number from any base to decimal.
- Iterates through the digits in the correct order (most significant to least significant).
- Compares the decimal values of the two numbers correctly.

The program meets the problem description for all potential cases, assuming valid input is provided (i.e., the input follows the format specified in the problem description, including the constraints on the number of digits, the base, and the digits themselves). 

Given the constraints and assuming valid input, the program will always produce the correct output according to the problem description. It converts numbers from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal and compares them correctly, which is exactly what the problem asks for.
