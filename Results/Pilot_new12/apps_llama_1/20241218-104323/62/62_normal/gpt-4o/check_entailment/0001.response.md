Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a correct implementation of the problem description. It reads the input correctly, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and then compares them. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of digits and the base of the first number, followed by the digits themselves. The same process is repeated for the second number.

2. The program converts the numbers to decimal correctly: The function `func_1` uses a loop to iterate over each digit of the number. For each digit, it multiplies the current decimal value by the base and adds the digit. This is the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.

3. The program compares the decimal values correctly: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them using simple if-elif-else statements. If the first number is less than the second, it prints '<'. If the first number is greater than the second, it prints '>'. If the numbers are equal, it prints '='.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the numbers have different numbers of digits or bases. It also handles cases where the numbers are equal, less than, or greater than each other.

The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly outputs '=' because the decimal values of the two numbers are equal (47). In the second example, the program correctly outputs '<' because the decimal value of the first number (21) is less than the decimal value of the second number (24). In the third example, the program correctly outputs '>' because the decimal value of the first number is greater than the decimal value of the second number.

In summary, the program is correct because it reads the input correctly, converts the numbers to decimal correctly, and compares the decimal values correctly. It handles all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output for the examples provided in the problem description.
