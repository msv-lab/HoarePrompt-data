Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly compares two numbers X and Y represented in different bases. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly:

1. The program first reads the input for the number of digits and the base for both X and Y.
2. It then reads the digits for both numbers.
3. The function `func_1` is used to convert the digits of a number from a given base to decimal.
4. The decimal values of both X and Y are calculated using the `func_1` function.
5. Finally, the program compares the decimal values of X and Y and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.

The code handles all the cases as specified in the problem description, including:

- Non-zero and zero digits
- Different bases for X and Y
- Positive numbers
- No leading zeroes
- All digits are given in the standard decimal numeral system

The provided examples in the problem description also work correctly with the given program.

Since the code handles all the specified cases and examples correctly, and no potential case can be found where the program does not work as expected, the program is correct.
