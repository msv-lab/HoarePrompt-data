Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input in the specified format, including the number of digits in the base representation of X and Y, the base values, and the digits themselves.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` correctly converts the given digits in a specific base to their decimal representation. It iterates through each digit from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit. This process is mathematically accurate and follows the standard procedure for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares their values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '='), which aligns with the problem description's requirements.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Since the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can disregard potential issues with invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers, bases outside the specified range, or non-numeric inputs). The program is designed under the premise that it will receive well-formed input that adheres to the problem's constraints.

The logic of the program, from input to comparison and output, aligns with the problem's description. It correctly handles the conversion of numbers from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal and compares them as requested. Thus, under the assumption of valid input and the constraints provided, the program performs its intended function as described in the problem statement.
