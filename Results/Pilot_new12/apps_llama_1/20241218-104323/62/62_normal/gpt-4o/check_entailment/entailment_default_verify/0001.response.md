Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and compares them. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base, and it handles empty lists by returning 0, ensuring consistency across all possible inputs.

The output hints confirm that the function converts a list of non-negative integers representing digits in a given base to its equivalent decimal value and that it accepts a list of digits and an integer base as input and returns the decimal value. The hints also indicate that the function does not modify the input list or perform any error checking on the base or digits beyond what is implicit in its calculation, implying that it assumes the input is valid according to the specified constraints.

The program's behavior aligns with the problem description, which requires comparing two numbers represented in different bases. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

Therefore, I will maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
