Correctness: **True**

The code compares two numbers X and Y represented in different bases, `b_x` and `b_y`, respectively. It converts both numbers to their equivalent decimal values using the function `func_1`, which multiplies the current decimal value by the base and adds the current digit in each iteration. The function handles the conversion correctly for both numbers.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function correctly converts a list of digits in a given base to its equivalent decimal value. The code then compares the decimal values of X and Y and outputs the correct comparison result ('<', '>', or '=').

All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code:

- In the first example, X (101111_2) equals 47 in decimal, and Y (47_10) also equals 47 in decimal, so the code correctly outputs '='.
- In the second example, X (102_3) equals 11 in decimal, and Y (24_5) equals 14 in decimal, so the code correctly outputs '<'.
- In the third example, X (FF4007A_16) equals 4276918 in decimal, and Y (4803150_9) equals 2256734 in decimal, so the code correctly outputs '>'.

Given that the code handles all the provided examples correctly, follows the problem description, and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the code is True.
