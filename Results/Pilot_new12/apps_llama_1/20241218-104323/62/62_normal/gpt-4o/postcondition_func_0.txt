The function converts a list of non-negative integers representing digits in a given base (between 2 and 40) to its equivalent decimal value. It accepts a list of digits and an integer base as input and returns the decimal value. The function handles empty lists by returning 0, ensuring consistency across all possible inputs. It does not modify the input list or perform any error checking on the base or digits beyond what is implicit in its calculation, implying it assumes the input is valid according to the specified constraints. The function's output is determined solely by the input digits and base, with no side effects or modifications to external state.
