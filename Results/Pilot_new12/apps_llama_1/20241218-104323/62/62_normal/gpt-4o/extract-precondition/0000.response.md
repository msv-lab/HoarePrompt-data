To compare the two numbers X and Y in different bases, we need to understand the input variables. The problem description provides detailed information about the input.

For number X:
- `n` is the number of digits in the base `b_x` representation of X.
- `b_x` is the base of the number X, where 2 ≤ `b_x` ≤ 40.
- `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` are the digits of X in base `b_x`, given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one, where 0 ≤ `x_i` < `b_x`.

For number Y:
- `m` is the number of digits in the base `b_y` representation of Y.
- `b_y` is the base of the number Y, where 2 ≤ `b_y` ≤ 40 and `b_x` ≠ `b_y`.
- `y_1, y_2,..., y_m` are the digits of Y in base `b_y`, given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one, where 0 ≤ `y_i` < `b_y`.

Given this information, we can describe the precondition as follows:

Precondition: **digits is a list of non-negative integers and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40, and all elements in digits are less than base.**
