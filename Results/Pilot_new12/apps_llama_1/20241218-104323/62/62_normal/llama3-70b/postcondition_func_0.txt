The function converts a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent and returns the result. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. The function accepts two parameters: a list of non-negative integers `digits` and an integer `base` between 2 and 40 (inclusive). The function performs the conversion by iterating over the list of digits and calculating the decimal equivalent. It handles the edge case where the input list is empty, in which case it returns 0. The function does not modify the input list or base, and it does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative digits, base outside the range 2-40, or non-integer inputs). After execution, the program state will have the input list and base unchanged, and the return value will be the decimal equivalent of the input number in the given base, or 0 if the input list is empty.
