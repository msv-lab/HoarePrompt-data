The `result` is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. If `digits` is not empty, `result` equals the decimal equivalent, otherwise `result` equals 0. 
Given that `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40 and for all original `digit` in `digits`, 0 ≤ original `digit` < `base`, `result` will be the decimal value of the number formed by `digits` in the given base.
Output State: **The program returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base` if `digits` is not empty, otherwise it returns 0**
