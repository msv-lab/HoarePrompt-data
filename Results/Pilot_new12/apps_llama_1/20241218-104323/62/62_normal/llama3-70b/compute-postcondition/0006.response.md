The given code is: 
```
result = result * base + digit
```
Given the initial state: 
- `digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements.
- `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive).
- For all `digit` in `digits`, `digit` is between 0 and `base` (exclusive).
- `result` equals the third element in `digits` multiplied by `base` plus the third element in `digits`.
- `digit` is the third element in `digits`.

Since `result` initially equals the third element in `digits` multiplied by `base` plus the third element in `digits`, and `digit` is the third element in `digits`, we can express the initial `result` as `result = digit * base + digit`.

After executing the given code, `result` is updated to `result * base + digit`. Substituting the initial value of `result`, we get `result = (digit * base + digit) * base + digit`.

This simplifies to `result = digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`, which can be further simplified to `result = digit * (base^2 + base + 1)`.

The state of `digits`, `base`, and `digit` remains unchanged as the code only updates the value of `result`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), for all `digit` in `digits`, `digit` is between 0 and `base` (exclusive), `digit` is the third element in `digits`, `result` equals `digit` multiplied by (`base` squared plus `base` plus 1)**
