The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of non-negative integers, and `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive). Additionally, each digit in `digits` must be less than `base`. After executing the function body, if `digits` is not empty, the function returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`; otherwise, it returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of digits and a base, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the digits in the given base if the list is not empty, otherwise it returns 0.**
