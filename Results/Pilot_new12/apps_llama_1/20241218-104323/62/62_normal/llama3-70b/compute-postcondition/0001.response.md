To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to examine the loop statement and the given program state.

The loop statement is `for digit in digits:`, which means the loop will iterate over each element `digit` in the list `digits`.

Given the program state before the loop starts:
- `digits` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40.
- For all `digit` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digit` < `base`.
- `result` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `digits` must not be empty, meaning it must have at least one element. Since `digit` takes the value of each element in `digits` during iteration, at the start of the loop, `digit` should be the first element in `digits`.

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40 and for all `digit` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digit` < `base`, `result` is 0, `digit` is the first element in `digits`**
