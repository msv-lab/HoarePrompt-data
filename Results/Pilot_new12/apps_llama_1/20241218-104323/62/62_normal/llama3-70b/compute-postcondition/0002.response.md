The code multiplies the current `result` by `base` and adds the value of `digit` to it. 

Since `result` is initially 0, multiplying it by `base` will still result in 0. Then, adding `digit` to this product will simply set `result` to the value of `digit`. 

The values of `digits`, `base`, and the fact that `digit` is the first element in `digits` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40 and for all `digit` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digit` < `base`, `result` is equal to `digit`, `digit` is the first element in `digits`**
