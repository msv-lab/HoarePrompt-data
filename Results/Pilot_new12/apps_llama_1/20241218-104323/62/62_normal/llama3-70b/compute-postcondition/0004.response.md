The value of `result` is updated to be the product of the original `result` and `base`, plus `digit`. Since `result` is initially equal to the second element in `digits` and `digit` is also the second element in `digits`, we can express the new value of `result` as `result = (second element in digits) * base + (second element in digits)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40 and for all `digit` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digit` < `base`, `result` is equal to the second element in `digits` multiplied by `base` plus the second element in `digits`, `digit` is the second element in `digits`**
