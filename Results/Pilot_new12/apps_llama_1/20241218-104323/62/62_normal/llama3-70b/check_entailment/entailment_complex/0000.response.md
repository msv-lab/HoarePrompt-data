Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of how the program works:

1. It reads the input as specified in the problem description: two space-separated integers for the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y, followed by the digits of each number.

2. The program then uses a function `func_1` to convert the list of digits of each number to its decimal equivalent. This function works by iterating over the list of digits from left to right (i.e., from most significant to least significant), and at each step, it multiplies the current result by the base and adds the current digit. This is a standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to decimal.

3. After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them using the standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`) and prints the result as specified in the problem description (`<` if X is less than Y, `>` if X is greater than Y, and `=` if X is equal to Y).

The program correctly handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, including the edge case where the input list is empty (although the problem description guarantees that the input lists will not be empty). 

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., that the input will always be a list of non-negative integers and an integer base between 2 and 40, inclusive) is also explicitly stated in the problem description, so the program does not need to include error checking code to handle invalid inputs.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the algorithm described in the problem description and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
