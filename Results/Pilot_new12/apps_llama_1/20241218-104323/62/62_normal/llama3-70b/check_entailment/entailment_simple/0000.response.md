Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1.  The program reads the input correctly:
    *   It takes two space-separated integers `n` and `b_x` as input, where `n` is the number of digits in the `b_x`-based representation of `X` and `b_x` is the base of `X`.
    *   Then, it reads `n` space-separated integers representing the digits of `X`.
    *   Similarly, it takes two space-separated integers `m` and `b_y` as input, where `m` is the number of digits in the `b_y`-based representation of `Y` and `b_y` is the base of `Y`.
    *   Finally, it reads `m` space-separated integers representing the digits of `Y`.

2.  The `func_1` function correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal:
    *   For each number, it initializes a variable `result` to 0.
    *   Then, it iterates through the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant), multiplying the current `result` by the base and adding the current digit.
    *   This process converts the number from its original base to decimal.
    *   If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the decimal equivalent of an empty number in any base.

3.  The program compares the decimal equivalents of `X` and `Y` and outputs the correct result:
    *   If `X` (in decimal) is less than `Y`, it prints `<`.
    *   If `X` is greater than `Y`, it prints `>`.
    *   If `X` is equal to `Y`, it prints `=`.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly, its correctness is confirmed.
