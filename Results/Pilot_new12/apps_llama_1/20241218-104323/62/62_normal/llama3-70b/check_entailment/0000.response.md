Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. Here's why:

1. The `func_1` function converts a list of digits in a given base to a decimal number. This is done by iterating through the digits from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit.

2. The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y.

3. It then uses the `func_1` function to convert both numbers to decimal.

4. The comparison is straightforward: if X is less than Y, it prints '<'; if X is greater than Y, it prints '>'; otherwise, it prints '='.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Different bases for X and Y
- X and Y having different numbers of digits
- The bases being greater than 10 (using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for higher bases)
- The input being well-formed (no leading zeroes, positive numbers, etc.)

All the examples provided work correctly with this program. Without any specific edge cases or counterexamples, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
