Correctness: **True**

The program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. The `func_1` function converts the given digits and base into a decimal number, which can then be compared directly. 

The logic of the program is as follows:
- It first reads the number of digits and the base for the number X, then reads the digits of X.
- It does the same for the number Y.
- It then converts the digits and bases of X and Y into decimal numbers using the `func_1` function.
- Finally, it compares the two decimal numbers and prints '<', '>', or '=' based on whether X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y, respectively.

The `func_1` function works by iterating over each digit in the given list of digits, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The program correctly handles all the given examples and should work correctly for any valid input, as long as the input is a positive integer and the base is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and there are no leading zeroes. 

Since the program correctly implements the logic to compare numbers in different bases and there are no obvious edge cases that it does not handle, the program is correct.
