Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. The function `func_1` converts a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent, which allows for comparison between numbers in different bases.

The program handles the cases where the input lists are not empty, and the bases are within the range of 2-40. It also correctly handles the comparison between the two numbers.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y, and the program correctly outputs '='. In the second example, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, and the program correctly outputs '<'. In the third example, X = FF4007A_16 and Y = 4803150_9, and the program correctly outputs '>'.

The output hints also agree with the code, as the function `func_1` correctly converts the list of digits to its decimal equivalent.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case.
