Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code accurately follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. The main part of the program compares two numbers represented in different bases by first converting each number to decimal using the `func_1` function and then comparing the decimal equivalents.

The output hints agree with the code, explaining how the conversion function works. The program correctly handles the edge case where the input lists are not empty, as specified in the problem description. The assumption that the input will be valid (e.g., non-empty lists, positive integers, and bases within the specified range) is reasonable and aligns with the problem description.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, the first example compares two numbers represented in base 2 and base 10, respectively, and correctly outputs '=' because the decimal equivalents of the two numbers are equal.

Overall, the program accurately implements the comparison of two numbers represented in different bases, and there are no apparent cases where it does not work as expected according to the problem description.
