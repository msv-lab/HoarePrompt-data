The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of input integers. The value of `n` is not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order**.
