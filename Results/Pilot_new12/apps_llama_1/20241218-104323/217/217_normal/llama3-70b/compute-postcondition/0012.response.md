To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order
- `i` is an even number greater than 0
- `b` is equal to `a[0]`
- `c` is 0
- `n` must be greater than `i`

The code is:
```python
c += a[i]
```

Given that `i` is an even number and `n` must be greater than `i`, and considering that list indices in Python start at 0, `i` must be less than `n` but also a valid index for the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list in descending order and `b` equals `a[0]`, the value of `a[i]` will be one of the elements in the list `a`, specifically the one at the index `i`.

The operation `c += a[i]` increments the value of `c` by the value of the element at index `i` in list `a`. Initially, `c` is 0, so after the operation, `c` will be equal to `a[i]`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `b` do not change because of this operation. Only the value of `c` changes.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order
- `i` is an even number greater than 0
- `b` is equal to `a[0]`
- `c` is equal to `a[i]`
- `n` must be greater than `i`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `i` is an even number greater than 0, `b` is equal to `a[0]`, `c` is equal to `a[i]`, and `n` must be greater than `i`**
