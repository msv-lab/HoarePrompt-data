The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, we can infer that the function operates on two lines of input: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers. 

Given the constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and the integers in the second line are also integers such that -100 <= `a_i` <= 100 for 1 <= `i` <= `n`. 

Since the function does not take any explicit parameters but rather reads from input, and the output description is missing, we cannot directly fill in the return value based on the provided information. 

However, following the required format for describing functionality, we acknowledge the absence of explicit parameters and the reliance on input for `n` and the subsequent integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads input for an integer n and n subsequent integers, operating within the given constraints of 1 <= n <= 100 and -100 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n.**
