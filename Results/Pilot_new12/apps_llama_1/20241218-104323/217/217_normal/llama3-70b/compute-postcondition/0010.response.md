According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `i` is an odd number greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` will be an even number. Since `i` is now even, `b` will be equal to `a[0]` and `c` will be 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `i` is an even number greater than 0, `b` is equal to `a[0]`, `c` is 0, and `n` must be greater than `i`**
