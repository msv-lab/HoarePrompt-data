Given the initial state and the provided code, let's analyze the changes:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i + 1`. 
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order.
- `i` is an even number greater than 0 and equal to `i + 2`, which implies `i` must be an invalid or contradictory statement since an even number cannot be equal to itself plus 2 (except in a hypothetical or incorrectly stated scenario). However, following the logical structure provided, if we consider `i` simply as an even number greater than 0 without the equality to `i + 2`, then we proceed.
- `b` will be equal to `a[0] + a[i + 2]`.
- `c` will be 0.

Given `i` is an even number and assuming the intention was to state `i` is a specific even number without the self-contradictory equality, the operation `b += a[i]` implies that `b`'s value is updated by adding the value of `a` at index `i`.

So, the initial value of `b` is `a[0] + a[i + 2]`, and after the operation, `b` becomes `a[0] + a[i + 2] + a[i]`.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i + 1`.
- `a` remains a sorted list of input integers in descending order.
- `i` is an even number greater than 0.
- `b` is now equal to `a[0] + a[i + 2] + a[i]`.
- `c` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `i` is an even number greater than 0, `b` is `a[0] + a[i + 2] + a[i]`, and `c` is 0**
