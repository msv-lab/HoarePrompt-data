To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100.
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order.
- `i` is an even number greater than 0.
- `b` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `c` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than `i`.

Given the code `b += a[i]`, we need to consider the impact on the variables.

- The value of `b` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Initially, `b` was equal to `a[0]`, so after the update, `b` will be equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.
- The list `a` is sorted in descending order, which means that `a[0]` is the largest element in the list.
- Since `i` is an even number greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than `i`, and given that `n` can be at most 100, `i` can be any even number from 2 up to 99 (since `n` has to be greater than `i`).
- The value of `a[i]` will depend on the index `i` but will always be less than or equal to `a[0]` because the list is sorted in descending order.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `c` are not changed by the code.

Therefore, the output state, considering all the given information, is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i`.
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order.
- `i` is an even number greater than 0.
- `b` is equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.
- `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i`, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `i` is an even number greater than 0, `b` is equal to `a[0] + a[i]`, `c` is 0**
