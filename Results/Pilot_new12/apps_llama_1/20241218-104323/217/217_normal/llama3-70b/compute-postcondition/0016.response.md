To solve this problem, let's first analyze the initial conditions and then apply the given code to see how it affects the variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i + 1`.
- `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order.
- `i` is an even number greater than 0 and equal to `i + 2`. This implies `i` must be a specific value that satisfies this condition. The only way this can be true is if `i` equals a value that when increased by 2 does not change its value in the context of this problem, which seems to be a contradiction or a misunderstanding since `i` cannot literally be equal to `i + 2` in a conventional sense. However, if we interpret the condition as `i` being an even number and there's been a misunderstanding in the representation of its relationship with itself, we might need to reassess this condition. Normally, `i` being an even number and greater than 0 could mean `i` = 2, 4, 6, etc., but with the given constraint, it seems there might be a need for clarification. For the sake of proceeding, let's consider the intention might have been to state `i` is a specific even number without the self-referential equality.
- `b` will be equal to `a[0] + a[i + 2]`.
- `c` will be 0.

Given the code `c += a[i]`, let's see how it affects the variables:

- `n` remains unchanged as the code does not directly or indirectly affect `n`.
- `a` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the list `a`.
- `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
- `b` is not directly affected by the code but its value is determined by `a[0]` and `a[i + 2]`, which are not changed by the code.
- `c` is initially 0 and is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. So, `c` becomes `a[i]`.

Considering the constraints and the effect of the code:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and `n` > `i + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `i` is an even number greater than 0, `b` is `a[0] + a[i + 2]`, and `c` is `a[i]`.**
