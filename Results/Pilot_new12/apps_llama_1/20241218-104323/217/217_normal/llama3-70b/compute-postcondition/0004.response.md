According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is within the specified range, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
