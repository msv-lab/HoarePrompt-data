The given code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `a`. The integers are obtained by taking an input, splitting it into a list of strings (using spaces as delimiters), and then converting each string to an integer.

The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. However, there is no direct relation between `n` and the code provided. The code only deals with the variable `a` and the input.

Given the information, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of input integers**
