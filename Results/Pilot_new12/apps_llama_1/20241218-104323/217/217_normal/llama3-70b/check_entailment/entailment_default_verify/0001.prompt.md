You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly in all cases. The problem requires us to find the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.

The provided program attempts to solve this by sorting the sequence in descending order and then adding elements at even indices to sequence b and at odd indices to sequence c. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-10 -20 -30
```
The program will sort the sequence in descending order and then add the elements as follows:
- -10 (at even index 0) to sequence b
- -20 (at odd index 1) to sequence c
- -30 (at even index 2) to sequence b

The sums will be B = -10 - 30 = -40 and C = -20, resulting in B - C = -20.

However, the optimal solution would be to add all elements to sequence b, resulting in B = -10 - 20 - 30 = -60 and C = 0, which gives B - C = -60.

The program does not consider this case and therefore does not work correctly for all possible inputs.

To fix this, we would need to modify the program to consider all possible partitions of the sequence and find the one that maximizes B - C. The current implementation does not achieve this. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))])
        c = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if not (mask & (1 << i))])
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no explicit parameters and reads input for an integer n and n subsequent integers, performs sorting in descending order on the input integers, calculates the sum of elements at even and odd indices separately, and then prints the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices. The final state of the program includes the input integer n and the n input integers being consumed, resulting in a program output that represents the calculated difference between the two sums, covering all potential cases within the given constraints of 1 <= n <= 100 and -100 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, including edge cases where n equals 1 or equals 100, and handling both positive and negative input integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
