Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to find the maximum possible value of `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of elements of sequence `b` and `C` is the sum of elements of sequence `c`. 

However, the program sorts the input sequence in descending order and then distributes the elements to `b` and `c` in an alternating manner. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of `B - C`, because it does not consider all possible ways to partition the input sequence into two sequences.

A correct approach would be to try all possible partitions of the input sequence into two sequences and calculate `B - C` for each partition. The maximum value of `B - C` among all partitions would be the answer.

For example, given the input `[1, -2, 0]`, the program would distribute the elements as `b = [1, 0]` and `c = [-2]`, resulting in `B - C = 3`. However, the maximum possible value of `B - C` for this input is `3`, which is achieved by choosing `b = [1, 0]` and `c = [-2]`, but the program does not consider the case where `b = [1]` and `c = [-2, 0]`, which results in `B - C = 1 - -2 = 3`, or the case where `b = [1, -2, 0]` and `c = []`, which results in `B - C = 1 - 2 + 0 = -1`. The correct approach would consider all possible partitions and choose the one that results in the maximum value of `B - C`.

The correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for i in range(2**n):
        b, c = 0, 0
        for j in range(n):
            if (i & (1 << j)) > 0:
                b += a[j]
            else:
                c += a[j]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```
This code tries all possible partitions of the input sequence into two sequences and calculates `B - C` for each partition. The maximum value of `B - C` among all partitions is the answer.
