You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it partitions the sequence into two sequences `b` and `c` in a way that is based on the index of the elements after sorting. However, the problem statement does not specify any particular partitioning strategy, and this greedy strategy may not always result in the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

For example, if the input is `2`, `1 -1`, the program will output `-2` because it will choose `b = 1` and `c = -1`. However, the optimal solution would be to choose `b = 1` and `c = {}` (an empty sequence), resulting in `B - C = 1 - 0 = 1`. 

This shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. It should consider all possible partitions of the sequence `a` to find the maximum possible value of `B - C`. 

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming, would be needed to consider all possible partitions and find the one that results in the maximum value of `B - C`. 

However, there is an easier way. We can get the maximum possible `B` (and therefore the maximum possible `B - C`) by including all non-negative numbers in `B` and all negative numbers in `C`. This ensures that `B` is maximized, while `C` is minimized, thus maximizing the difference `B - C`. 

Here is how the correct code would look like:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = sum(x for x in a if x >= 0)
    c = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    print(b - c)
```
This code correctly solves the problem by maximizing `B` and minimizing `C`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the integers in the second line are also integers such that -100 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b, c = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a sorted list of input integers in descending order, `b` is the sum of elements at even indices of `a` up to `n-1`, `c` is the sum of elements at odd indices of `a` up to `n-1`.
    print(b - c)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
