Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly in all cases. The problem requires us to find the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.

The provided program attempts to solve this by sorting the sequence in descending order and then adding elements at even indices to sequence b and at odd indices to sequence c. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-10 -20 -30
```
The program will sort the sequence in descending order and then add the elements as follows:
- -10 (at even index 0) to sequence b
- -20 (at odd index 1) to sequence c
- -30 (at even index 2) to sequence b

The sums will be B = -10 - 30 = -40 and C = -20, resulting in B - C = -20.

However, the optimal solution would be to add all elements to sequence b, resulting in B = -10 - 20 - 30 = -60 and C = 0, which gives B - C = -60.

The program does not consider this case and therefore does not work correctly for all possible inputs.

To fix this, we would need to modify the program to consider all possible partitions of the sequence and find the one that maximizes B - C. The current implementation does not achieve this. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))])
        c = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if not (mask & (1 << i))])
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```
