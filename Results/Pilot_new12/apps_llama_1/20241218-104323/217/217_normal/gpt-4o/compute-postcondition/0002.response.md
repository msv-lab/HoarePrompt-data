The given code calculates the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`. 

`B` is assigned the value of the sum of all `x` in `a` where `x` is greater than 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`.**
