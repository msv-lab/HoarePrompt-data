The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

The initial state mentions that the input consists of two lines, but the given code only reads the first line, which contains a positive integer `n`. 

So, after executing the code, `n` is a positive integer, and there is still a line of input left to be read, which contains `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, there are `n` integers left to be read from the input**
