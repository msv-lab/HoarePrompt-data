The code calculates the sum of all negative integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `C`. The value of `n` is unchanged, as it is the number of integers in `a`. The list `a` itself is also unchanged, but we now have a new variable `C` that represents the sum of all negative integers in `a`. The variable `B` is still the sum of all positive integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`, `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.**
