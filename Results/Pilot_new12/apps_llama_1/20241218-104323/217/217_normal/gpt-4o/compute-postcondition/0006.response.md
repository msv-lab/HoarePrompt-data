The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The input to the function consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_n`, where `-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100` for all `i`. 

However, since the function `func` does not have any parameters, we must assume the input is handled internally within the function, but the description provided does not specify how this input is used or what the output is based on this input. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine the exact functionality of `func` regarding its return value without knowing how the input integers are utilized within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, and its return value is undetermined based on the provided input of a positive integer n and n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_n.**
