The given code reads a line of input, splits it into strings, converts each string to an integer using the `map` function, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `a`. The number of integers left to be read from the input is `n`, which means we expect `n` integers in the input.

Since `a` is created by mapping `int` over the result of `input().split()`, `a` will be a list of `n` integers, assuming the input provides exactly `n` integers separated by spaces.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input**
