Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem description. It calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers (`B`) and the sum of all negative integers (`C`) in the given list of integers. This approach effectively maximizes the value of `B - C` because it assigns all positive numbers to `B` and all negative numbers to `C`, resulting in the maximum possible difference.

The program handles cases with positive, negative, and zero integers correctly by excluding zeros from both sums. When the input list contains all zeros, the program will correctly output `0`, as `B` and `C` will both be `0`. If the list contains all positive or all negative numbers, the program will also produce the correct result.

The problem description allows for any partitioning of the sequence into two sequences `b` and `c`, but the optimal solution is always achieved by assigning all positive numbers to `b` and all negative numbers to `c`, which is exactly what the program does. 

Therefore, the program always follows the problem description and produces the correct output for every valid input.
