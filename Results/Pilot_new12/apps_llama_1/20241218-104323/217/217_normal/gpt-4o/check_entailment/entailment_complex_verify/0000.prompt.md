You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a solution to the problem of finding the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c, after partitioning a given sequence a into two sequences b and c.

The program works as follows: it first reads the number of elements n in the sequence a and the elements themselves. Then it calculates the sum of all positive elements in the sequence (which will be part of sequence b) and the sum of all negative elements in the sequence (which will be part of sequence c). Finally, it calculates B - C, where B is the sum of elements in b and C is the sum of elements in c, and prints the result.

This approach is correct because the problem does not impose any constraints on the elements of sequences b and c, other than that every element in a must belong to exactly one of them. Therefore, to maximize B - C, it is optimal to put all positive elements in b and all negative elements in c, which is exactly what the program does.

Since the program handles all cases correctly according to the problem description, its correctness is **True**. The code handles both positive, negative, and zero values correctly. For example, if the input sequence is [1, -2, 0], the program correctly calculates B as 1 (the sum of positive elements) and C as -2 (the sum of negative elements), resulting in a maximum possible value of B - C = 3, which is the expected output. Similarly, if the input sequence is [16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8], the program correctly calculates B as 120 (the sum of all elements, since they are all positive) and C as 0 (since there are no negative elements), resulting in a maximum possible value of B - C = 120, which is also the expected output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_n, where -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for all i.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers in a given list of integers, then prints the result. It accepts no parameters, reads two lines of input from the user (a positive integer n and n integers), and its return value is undefined as it prints the result directly. The function handles cases with positive, negative, and zero integers, as well as edge cases where the input list contains all zeros or all positive/negative numbers. It does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer or where the number of integers does not match the first input number. After execution, the program state is that the result of the calculation has been printed to the console, and the input variables n and the list of integers are stored in memory, but not returned or used further.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
