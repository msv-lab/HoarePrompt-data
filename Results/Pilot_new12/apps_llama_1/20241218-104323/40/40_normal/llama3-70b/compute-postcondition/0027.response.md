Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is either its previous value if that value is 2 or greater, or 2 if its previous value was less than 2.***
