To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. 

The code `substr = s[i:j]` updates the value of `substr` based on the current values of `s`, `i`, and `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 5.
- `substr` is initially a string `s[2:5]`.

Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, `substr` will be assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index 2 up to but not including index 5, which is the same as its initial value because `s[2:5]` means the same.

Therefore, the value of `substr` remains `s[2:5]`, but it is reassigned based on the current values of `i` and `j`, which are 2 and 5 respectively. This means `substr` equals `s[2:5]`, which is the same as its initial condition.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is `s[2:5]`.**
