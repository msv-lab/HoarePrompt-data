Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its initial value and 3.**
