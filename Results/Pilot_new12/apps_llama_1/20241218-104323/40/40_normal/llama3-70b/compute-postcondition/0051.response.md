Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit string input from the user, with the assumption that the input string `s` is a non-empty string of at most 50 characters containing only lowercase English letters. The function calculates the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in the input string `s` and returns this length if it is greater than 0, otherwise, it returns 0. The function performs this action for all possible substrings of the input string, considering all edge cases where the input string itself could be a palindrome or could contain palindromic substrings of varying lengths. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has printed the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in the input string, or 0 if no such substrings exist, meaning all substrings are palindromes. However, it is worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the input string exceeds 50 characters or contains characters other than lowercase English letters, as these scenarios are not explicitly handled in the provided code.**
