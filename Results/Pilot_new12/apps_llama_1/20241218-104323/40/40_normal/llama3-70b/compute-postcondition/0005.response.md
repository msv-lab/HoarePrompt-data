The code `substr = s[i:j]` creates a substring `substr` from the string `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` will be in the range from 1 to `n`.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, `substr` will be a substring of `s` starting from the beginning of `s` and ending at some position in the range from the first character to the last character of `s`.

The length of `substr` will be `j - i`, which simplifies to `j` since `i` is 0.

The states of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Only `substr` is defined as a result of this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`.**
