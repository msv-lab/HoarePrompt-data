According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, and `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes. 

Since `i` is 1 and the loop starts from `i + 1`, the loop will start from 2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. However, it's already given that `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), so this condition is already satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be `i + 1`, which is 2. So, `j` is 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes**
