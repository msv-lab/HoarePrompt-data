To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
2. `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
3. `i` is 0.
4. `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`.
5. `substr` is `s[0:j]`.

The code updates `max_len` with the maximum value between the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[0:j]`, its length is `j` because it takes the first `j` characters of `s`.

Given that `j` ranges from 3 to `n + 1` and `n` is the length of `s`, the maximum possible value of `j` that still makes `s[0:j]` a valid substring of `s` is `n`, because attempting to access `s` up to index `n + 1` would go out of bounds. However, the code does not explicitly check for this, so we consider `j` can indeed reach up to `n + 1` as per the initial condition, but practically, for string operations, it's relevant up to `n`.

The initial state does not specify `max_len`, so we assume it's either not defined or has some initial value. The update to `max_len` will be based on comparing its current value (if any) to the length of `substr`, which is `j`. Since `j` can range from 3 to potentially `n + 1`, but we're dealing with substrings of `s`, the effective `j` for our consideration in terms of `s`'s length is up to `n`.

Thus, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j`, where `j` is effectively in the range of 3 to `n` when considering valid substrings of `s`.

The output state, considering the update of `max_len` based on `j` and the length of `s` (which is `n`), would be:

- `s` remains a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, but effectively up to `n` for considerations related to `s`.
- `substr` remains `s[0:j]`, but its effective consideration for length comparisons is up to `n`.
- `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `j`, where `j` can range from 3 to `n` for practical considerations related to the length of `s`.

Therefore, the specific value of `max_len` depends on the initial value of `max_len` (if any) and the range of `j` up to `n`, but it will be at most `n` since `j` effectively ranges up to `n` for valid substrings of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value (if any) and `j`, effectively up to `n`.**
