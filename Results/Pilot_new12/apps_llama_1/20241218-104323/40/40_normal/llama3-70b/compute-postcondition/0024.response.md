To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `max_len` and `substr` have properties based on whether `substr` (the second character of `s`) is a palindrome or not, but for the loop's execution, these values are less critical than `j`, `i`, and `n`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`. This means `j` will iterate from `i + 1` up to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to move to the next value in the range `range(i + 1, n + 1)`. Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` should be 3. 

However, we also need to consider `i`. In the given loop statement, `i` does not change within the loop; it's part of the loop definition. So, `i` remains 1 for all iterations of this loop. The progression happens through `j`.

Considering the conditions for `j` to move to the next iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 2 (since `j` needs to reach 3), implying `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
- `s`'s length (`n`) allows for `j` to be 3 (meaning `s` has at least 3 characters).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
