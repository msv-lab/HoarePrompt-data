Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2. If `substr` is a palindrome, `max_len` remains the same as its previous value.***
