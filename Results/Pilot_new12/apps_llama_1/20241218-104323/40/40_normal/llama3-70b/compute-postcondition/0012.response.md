Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and `j`.***
