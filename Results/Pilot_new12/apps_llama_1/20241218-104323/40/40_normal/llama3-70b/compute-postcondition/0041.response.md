To determine the impact of the code on the program, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet:

- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`.
- `max_len` is updated based on whether `s[2:4]` is a palindrome or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than any previous `max_len`, or remains the same if all such substrings are palindromes.

Given the code snippet:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

This line of code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[2:4]`, its length is 2 (because it includes characters at indices 2 and 3 of `s`).

Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2. 

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `substr`) are not affected by this line of code.

Thus, the output state, considering all given information and the effect of the code, is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.**
