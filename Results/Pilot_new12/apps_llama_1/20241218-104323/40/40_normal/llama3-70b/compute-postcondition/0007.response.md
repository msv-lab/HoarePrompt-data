The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is equal to `j`, which is in the range from 1 to `n`. 

Since `max_len` was initially 0 and the length of `substr` is `j`, the new value of `max_len` will be `j` because `j` is always greater than or equal to 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr` is not a palindrome).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j` and `substr` is not a palindrome.**
