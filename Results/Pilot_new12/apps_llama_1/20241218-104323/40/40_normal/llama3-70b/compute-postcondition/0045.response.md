To calculate the output state, let's consider the given information and the code snippet.


The initial state gives us the following information:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 5.
- `substr` is `s[2:5]`, which means it is a substring of `s` starting from index 2 up to but not including index 5.


Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, `substr` (`s[2:5]`) has a length of `j - i = 5 - 2 = 3`.


The code snippet is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```


However, the initial state does not specify the value of `max_len`. To provide a meaningful output, we need to consider the possible values of `max_len` relative to `len(substr)`.


Since `substr` is `s[2:5]` and given the values of `i` and `j`, `len(substr)` is 3.


If `max_len` is less than 3, it will be updated to 3. If `max_len` is 3 or greater, its value will not change.


Given the constraints and the code, the output state regarding the updated variables is as follows:


- `s` remains a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 5.
- `substr` remains `s[2:5]`.
- `max_len` is either updated to 3 if it was less than 3 or remains its previous value if it was 3 or greater.


Therefore, considering the specific lengths and the fact that `max_len` could either be updated to 3 or remain unchanged depending on its initial value, the most accurate output state given the provided information would reflect the potential update of `max_len` based on its comparison with the length of `substr`, which is 3.


Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is `s[2:5]`, and `max_len` is at least 3.**
