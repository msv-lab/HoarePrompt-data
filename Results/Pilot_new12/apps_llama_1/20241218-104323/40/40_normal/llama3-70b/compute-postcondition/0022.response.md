To calculate the impact of the code on the program, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given code snippet affects it.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.
- `substr` is the second character of `s`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome.

The code snippet given is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

This line of code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`.

Since `substr` is the second character of `s`, and given that `s` contains only lowercase English letters and is at least 2 characters long (because `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `n` equals the length of `s`), `substr` is a single character. Therefore, the length of `substr` is 1.

The initial value of `max_len` could be either 0 (if all substrings considered so far are palindromes) or a positive value (if non-palindromic substrings have been found). However, since `substr` is not a palindrome (as per the given condition), and it's a single character, its "non-palindromic" nature doesn't apply in the traditional sense used for longer strings, but since it's stated not to be equal to its reverse, this is a special case. However, given `substr` is a single character, it's always equal to its reverse, making the statement about it not being a palindrome potentially confusing. For the sake of this exercise, we'll proceed under the assumption that the condition about `substr` not being a palindrome was an error or misinterpretation, and what's key is that `substr` is a single character.

Given `substr` is a single character (length of 1), the `max` function will choose the maximum between the current `max_len` and 1. If `max_len` was 0 (indicating all substrings considered were palindromes or this is the first non-palindromic substring encountered), it will be updated to 1. If `max_len` was already greater than 1, its value remains unchanged because 1 (the length of `substr`) is not greater than any value of `max_len` that is already greater than 1.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `s` remains a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` remains 2.
- `max_len` is updated to be at least 1 if it was 0, or remains its current value if it was already greater than 1.
- `substr` remains the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is at least 1 (or its previous value if that was greater than 1), and `substr` is the second character of `s`.**
