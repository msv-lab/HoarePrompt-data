Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is `s[2:5]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is at least 3. Otherwise, no additional conditions are imposed.***
