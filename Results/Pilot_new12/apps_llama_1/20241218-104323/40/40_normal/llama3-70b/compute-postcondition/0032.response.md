To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's functionality. The loop iterates through substrings of `s` starting from the second character (`i = 1`) to the end of `s` (`n`), and for each substring, it checks if the substring is not equal to its reverse. If it's not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length between the current `max_len` and the length of the non-palindromic substring.

Given the loop's code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr!= substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
And the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

After all iterations, `j` will have reached `n + 1`, but since the loop ends when `j` is about to exceed `n`, the last valid `j` considered is `n`. The variable `i` remains 1 throughout the loop as it is not modified inside or outside the loop. The string `s` and its length `n` do not change, as the loop only reads from `s` without modifying it. The `substr` variable's value will change with each iteration but will be the last considered substring when the loop ends, which is `s[1:n]`.

The key point is understanding how `max_len` evolves. Initially, `max_len` could be 0 if all substrings considered up to that point are palindromes. As the loop progresses, if any non-palindromic substring is found, `max_len` gets updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of the newly found non-palindromic substring.

Considering all possible scenarios:
- If all substrings of `s` (starting from the second character to any point beyond) are palindromes, then `max_len` remains 0, which is its initial value for the case where no non-palindromic substrings are found.
- If any non-palindromic substring is found during the iterations, `max_len` will be updated to the length of the longest such substring found.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`, starting from the second character, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.**
