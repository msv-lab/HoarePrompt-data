The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` to `substr`, starting from index `i` to `j`. Given the initial state, `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`. 

`s[i:j]` means we are taking a substring from `s` starting at index `i` (which is 0) up to but not including index `j`. Since `j` is between 2 and `n` (inclusive) and `n` is the length of `s`, the length of `substr` will be `j`, because we're starting from index 0 and going up to but not including `j`.

The states of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Only the value of `substr` is updated. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`, starting from the beginning of `s` up to the `j-th` character.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, and `substr` is `s[0:j]`.**
