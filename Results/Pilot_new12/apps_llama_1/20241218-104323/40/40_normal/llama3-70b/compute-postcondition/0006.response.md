Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr` is not a palindrome).**
