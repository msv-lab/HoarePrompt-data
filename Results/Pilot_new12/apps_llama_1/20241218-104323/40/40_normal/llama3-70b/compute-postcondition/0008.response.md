Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`, if `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is `j`, otherwise `max_len` remains 0**
