According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` is between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the length of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5. 
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `substr` is a string `s[2:5]`**
