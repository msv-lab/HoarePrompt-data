To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`.

The given code is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Here, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` has a length of 3 (as given in the initial state), `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

However, the initial value of `max_len` is not specified in the problem. Assuming `max_len` is an integer variable that has been initialized before this line of code (though its initial value is not provided), its value after this operation will depend on its initial value. If `max_len` is less than 3, it will be updated to 3; otherwise, its value will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its initial value and 3.

Since we do not know the initial value of `max_len`, we cannot provide a more specific value for `max_len` in the output state.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its initial value and 3.**
