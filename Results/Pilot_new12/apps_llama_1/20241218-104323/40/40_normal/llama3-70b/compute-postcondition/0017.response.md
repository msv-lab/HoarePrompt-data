To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

1. The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
2. In each iteration, a substring `substr` is extracted from `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.
3. The code checks if `substr` is not a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).
4. If `substr` is not a palindrome, the code updates `max_len` with the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can observe that:

* `s` remains the same non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
* `n` remains the same integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
* `i` remains 0, as it is not updated inside the loop.
* `j` takes values from 1 to `n` in each iteration.
* `substr` is a substring of `s` with varying lengths.
* `max_len` is updated with the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `s` and `n` retain their original values.
* `i` remains 0.
* `j` is no longer relevant, as the loop has finished.
* `substr` is no longer relevant, as the loop has finished.
* `max_len` contains the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in the entire string `s`. If all substrings are palindromes, `max_len` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.**
