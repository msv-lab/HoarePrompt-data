Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes, `substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome.**
