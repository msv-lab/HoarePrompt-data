To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is: `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]`.
- If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is 1 or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than 1, otherwise `max_len` remains as the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. So, `j` will become 4.

Additionally, since `j` is now 4, `substr` should be updated to `s[2:4]` (considering `i` remains 2, as the loop for `i` is not provided, and we're only considering the loop for `j` here), and `max_len` should be updated based on whether `s[2:4]` is a palindrome or not, following the same logic as before.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`, and `max_len` is updated based on whether `s[2:4]` is a palindrome or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than any previous `max_len`, or remains the same if all such substrings are palindromes**
