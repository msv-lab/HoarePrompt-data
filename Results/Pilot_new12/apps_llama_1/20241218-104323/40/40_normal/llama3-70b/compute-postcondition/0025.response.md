The value of `substr` is assigned the substring of `s` starting at index `i` (which is 1) and ending at index `j` (which is 3). Since `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, and `n` is equal to the length of `s`, the states of `s` and `n` are not affected. The states of `i` and `j` are also not affected. The variable `substr` is assigned a substring of `s` with length 2 (since `j` - `i` = 3 - 1 = 2).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`.**
