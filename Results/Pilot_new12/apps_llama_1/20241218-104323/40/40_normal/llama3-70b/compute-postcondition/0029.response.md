The code assigns a substring of `s` to the variable `substr`. The substring starts at index `i` (which is 1) and ends at index `j` (which is 4). Since Python uses zero-based indexing, this means the substring will include characters at indices 1, 2, and 3.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, and `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, the length of the substring `substr` will be `j - i = 4 - 1 = 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is a string of length 3, equal to `s[1:4]`.**
