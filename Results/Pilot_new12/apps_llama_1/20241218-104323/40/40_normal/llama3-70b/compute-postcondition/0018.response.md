According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes**
