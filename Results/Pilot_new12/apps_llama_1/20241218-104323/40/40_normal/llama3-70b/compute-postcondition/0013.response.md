According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1` and `i + 1` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, `n` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`. But since `j` is in the range of the loop from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, for `j` to be in this new range, `i` remains the same (0) or `j` will never reach `n + 1`, since `j` is increased from `i + 1` in every iteration, so `j` can be in the range 3 to `n + 1`. For `j` to be at least 3, the string must be long enough to have a substring of length 3. So `n` is still between 2 and 50, `s` length `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`**
