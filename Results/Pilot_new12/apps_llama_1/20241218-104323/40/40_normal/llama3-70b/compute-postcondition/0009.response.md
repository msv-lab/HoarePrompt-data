According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i + 1` and `n + 1`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, thus `j` is now in the range from 2 to `n`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The loop condition is `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, so for `j` to be in this range and execute the loop one more time, `j` should be at least 2 and at most `n`. If `j` is equal to `n`, then `n` should be at least 2, because we have already had one iteration of the loop. The string `s` is still a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only. The variable `n` remains the same as it is the length of `s`. The variable `substr` will be a substring of `s` with length `j`, which is now at least 2 and at most `n`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` will be updated to `j`, otherwise it remains the same.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` with length `j`**
