To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`.
- `max_len` is updated based on whether `s[2:4]` is a palindrome or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than any previous `max_len`, or remains the same if all such substrings are palindromes.

Given the code `substr = s[i:j]`:

- Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, `substr` will be assigned the value of `s[2:4]`, which is the same as its initial value.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `max_len` are not changed by this operation.
- The only change is that `substr` is reassigned the same value it already had, based on the current values of `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the output state remains largely the same as the initial state, with `substr` still being `s[2:4]`, and all other variables retaining their initial values and properties.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string `s[2:4]`, and `max_len` is updated based on whether `s[2:4]` is a palindrome or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than any previous `max_len`, or remains the same if all such substrings are palindromes**
