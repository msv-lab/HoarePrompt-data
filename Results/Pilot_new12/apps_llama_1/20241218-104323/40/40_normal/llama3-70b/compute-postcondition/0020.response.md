The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. 

Given that `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `substr` will be a substring of length 1 (because the end index in Python is exclusive), which is `s[1:2]`, essentially the character at index 1 in the string `s`.

The states of `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `max_len` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, `substr` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, `substr` is the second character of `s`**
