The code `substr = s[i:j]` extracts a substring from `s` starting at index `i` (2) and ending at index `j` (3). 

Given the initial state: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.

The new variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring `s[2:3]`, which is a single character since `j - i` equals 1.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `max_len`) are not affected by the creation of `substr`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, 
`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 3, 
`max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes, 
`substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes, `substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]`.**
