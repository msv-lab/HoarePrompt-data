Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value (if any) and `j`, effectively up to `n`.***
