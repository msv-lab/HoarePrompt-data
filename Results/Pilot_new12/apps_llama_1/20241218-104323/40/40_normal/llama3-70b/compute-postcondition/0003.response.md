According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the length of `s`, we can confirm that the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`. Also, `max_len` is 0. For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to 0 (since the loop iterates over `range(n)`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
