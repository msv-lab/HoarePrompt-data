To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Given that `substr` has a length of 2 (as it is defined as `s[1:3]`, which are two characters), `len(substr)` will always be 2. 

However, the initial value of `max_len` is not specified in the problem. Since we are only updating `max_len` based on its current value and the length of `substr`, and we know `len(substr)` is 2, the new value of `max_len` will depend on its initial value. 

If the initial value of `max_len` is less than 2, `max_len` will become 2. If `max_len` is already 2 or greater, its value will not change because `max(2 or more, 2)` equals `2 or more`.

The states of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Therefore, the output state, considering all possible scenarios for `max_len`, is:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`.
- `max_len` is either its previous value if that value is 2 or greater, or 2 if its previous value was less than 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]`, and `max_len` is either its previous value if that value is 2 or greater, or 2 if its previous value was less than 2.**
