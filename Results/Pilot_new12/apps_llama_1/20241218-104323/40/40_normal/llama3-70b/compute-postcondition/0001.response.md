The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, the value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The state of `s` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, equal to the input string, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`**
