Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, `substr` is the second character of `s`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome**
