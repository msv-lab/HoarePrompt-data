The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is `j`, since `substr` is defined as `s[0:j]`. 

The value of `max_len` is now the maximum of its previous value and `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and `j`.**
