The given code prints the value of `max_len` if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0. This means that `max_len` is the value that is being printed. 

The value of `max_len` is either the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes. 

Other variables such as `s`, `n`, `i` are not affected by this print statement.

The output of the print statement is a value equal to `max_len` if `max_len` > 0, otherwise the output is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of the original string `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, and the value `max_len` if `max_len` > 0, otherwise 0 has been printed.**
