Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if `substr` (the second character of `s`) is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is at least 1 (or its previous value if that was greater than 1), otherwise `max_len` remains unchanged, and `substr` is the second character of `s`**
