According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is between 3 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 to 4, and for the loop to have a next iteration, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `j` starts from `i + 1` and `i` is 1).

Additionally, since `i` is not changing in the given for loop statement and is constant at 1, and `s` is a string of length `n`, the adjusted states should also consider `i` remaining the same and `s` being able to accommodate the changes in `j` and `n`. 

`substr` is a string with length 2 equal to `s[1:3]` initially, but since the loop progresses with `j`, we should consider what happens next. Given the loop structure and the incremental nature of `j`, when `j` moves to 4, `substr` should conceptually move to `s[1:4]` if we were considering substrings in a dynamic manner, but the actual adjustment of `substr` depends on how it's used within the loop body which isn't provided. However, our main focus is on the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute again.

Thus, considering all adjustments, the new state should reflect an increment in `j` and potentially an adjustment in how we consider `substr` and the conditions on `n` to facilitate another iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 4 characters and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
