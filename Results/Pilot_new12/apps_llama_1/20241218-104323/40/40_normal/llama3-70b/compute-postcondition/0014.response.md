`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, the value of `substr` is now a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending at index `j`. The length of `substr` is `j`, which is between 3 and `n + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still equal to the length of `s`. The value of `s` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at least 3 and at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`, `substr` is `s[0:j]`.**
