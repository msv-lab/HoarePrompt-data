The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]`, its length is 1. The previous value of `max_len` was the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes. 

Given that `substr` is not a palindrome, and its length is 1, `max_len` will be updated to 1 if it was 0, or remain the same if it was already greater than 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `max_len` is 1 or the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s` starting from the second character if it is greater than 1, `substr` is a single character string `s[2:3]` and is not a palindrome**
