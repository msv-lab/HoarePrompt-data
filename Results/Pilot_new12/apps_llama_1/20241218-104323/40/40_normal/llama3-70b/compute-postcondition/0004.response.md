To determine the state at the start of the for loop, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`, which is guaranteed since `i` starts at 0 and `n` is at least 1. Thus, the loop will always execute at least once given the initial conditions.

The variable `j` will take on values from `i + 1` (which is 1, given `i` is 0) up to `n` (inclusive), because the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, unless the stop value is specified as `n + 1` to include `n`.

The state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is to ensure that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, but given that `i` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 50, this condition is inherently satisfied.

Therefore, considering the loop's condition, the state at the start of the loop is adjusted as follows:
- `s` remains a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`.
- `max_len` remains 0.
- `i` is 0, and `j` will start from 1 (`i + 1`).

Thus, the adjusted state considering the loop's execution condition is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` will be in the range from 1 to `n`**
