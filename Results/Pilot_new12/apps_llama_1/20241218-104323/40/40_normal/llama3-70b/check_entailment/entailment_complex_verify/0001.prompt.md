You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks every possible substring of the input string `s` and checks if it's a palindrome or not. If it finds a non-palindrome substring, it updates the `max_len` variable with the length of the longest non-palindrome substring found so far. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program starts by taking the input string `s` and calculating its length `n`.
2. It initializes a variable `max_len` to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest non-palindrome substring found so far.
3. The program then uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of `s`. The outer loop starts from the first character of `s` and the inner loop starts from the next character of the outer loop's current position to the end of `s`.
4. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If it's not equal, it means the substring is not a palindrome.
5. If a non-palindrome substring is found, the program updates `max_len` with the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings found so far.
6. After checking all substrings, the program prints `max_len` if it's greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0.

The program correctly handles all possible cases because it checks every possible substring of the input string. It doesn't miss any substrings, and it correctly identifies non-palindrome substrings.

Additionally, the program passes all the test cases provided in the problem description:

- For the input "mew", it correctly returns 3 because "mew" itself is a non-palindrome substring.
- For the input "wuffuw", it correctly returns 5 because "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings of "wuffuw".
- For the input "qqqqqqqq", it correctly returns 0 because all substrings of "qqqqqqqq" are palindromes.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input variables are explicitly defined in the function, however, based on the problem description, the input variable is assumed to be a non-empty string s with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) equal to the length of the original string `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an implicit string input from the user, with the assumption that the input string `s` is a non-empty string of at most 50 characters containing only lowercase English letters. The function calculates the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in the input string `s` and returns this length if it is greater than 0, otherwise, it returns 0. The function performs this action for all possible substrings of the input string, considering all edge cases where the input string itself could be a palindrome or could contain palindromic substrings of varying lengths. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has printed the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in the input string, or 0 if no such substrings exist, meaning all substrings are palindromes. However, it is worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the input string exceeds 50 characters or contains characters other than lowercase English letters, as these scenarios are not explicitly handled in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
