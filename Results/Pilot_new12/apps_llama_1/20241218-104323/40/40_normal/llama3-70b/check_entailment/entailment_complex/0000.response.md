Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:
- It reads the input string `s` from the user.
- It iterates over all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops.
- For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`).
- If a non-palindromic substring is found, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length of such substrings.
- Finally, it prints `max_len` if it is greater than 0 (i.e., at least one non-palindromic substring exists) or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

The program handles all edge cases:
- If the input string is a palindrome, `max_len` will remain 0, and the program will print 0.
- If the input string contains a non-palindromic substring, `max_len` will be updated with the maximum length of such substrings.
- The program correctly handles input strings of varying lengths (up to 50 characters) and only containing lowercase English letters.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid, we do not need to consider cases where the input string exceeds 50 characters or contains characters other than lowercase English letters. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
