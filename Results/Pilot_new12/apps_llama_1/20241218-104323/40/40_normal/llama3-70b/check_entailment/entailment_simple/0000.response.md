Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
2. It initializes a variable `max_len` to 0, which will store the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings.
3. The program uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of `s`. For each substring, it checks if it is not a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`).
4. If a non-palindromic substring is found, the program updates `max_len` with the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far.
5. After checking all substrings, the program prints the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings (`max_len`) if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it prints 0.

The program correctly handles all cases specified in the problem description:

* If the input string is a palindrome, the program will not find any non-palindromic substrings and will print 0.
* If the input string has non-palindromic substrings, the program will find the maximum length of such substrings and print it.
* The program assumes that the input will be a valid non-empty string with length at most 50 characters, containing lowercase English letters only, which is in line with the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
