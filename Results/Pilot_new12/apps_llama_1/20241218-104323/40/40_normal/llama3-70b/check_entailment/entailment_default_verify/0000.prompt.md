You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program checks all possible substrings of the input string and checks if they are palindromes by comparing the substring with its reverse. If a substring is not a palindrome, its length is compared with the current maximum length, and the maximum length is updated if the current substring's length is greater. If no non-palindrome substrings are found, the program prints 0.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It checks all possible substrings of the input string, which ensures that all non-palindrome substrings are considered.
* It correctly identifies whether a substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
* It keeps track of the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings found so far.
* It handles the case where all substrings are palindromes by printing 0.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness for different input cases:

* For the input "mew", the program correctly prints 3, which is the length of the longest non-palindrome substring "mew".
* For the input "wuffuw", the program correctly prints 5, which is the length of the longest non-palindrome substring "uffuw".
* For the input "qqqqqqqq", the program correctly prints 0, which indicates that all substrings are palindromes.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible input cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an implicit string input from the user, with the assumption that the input string `s` is a non-empty string of at most 50 characters containing only lowercase English letters. The function calculates the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings in the input string `s` and returns this length if it is greater than 0, otherwise, it returns 0. The function performs this action for all possible substrings of the input string, considering all edge cases where the input string itself could be a palindrome or could contain palindromic substrings of varying lengths. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has printed the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in the input string, or 0 if no such substrings exist, meaning all substrings are palindromes. However, it is worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the input string exceeds 50 characters or contains characters other than lowercase English letters, as these scenarios are not explicitly handled in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
