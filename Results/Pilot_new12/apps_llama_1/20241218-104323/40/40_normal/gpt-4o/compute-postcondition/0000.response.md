The code `return s == s[::-1]` checks if the string `s` is equal to its reverse. Since `s` is a non-empty string containing at most 50 lowercase English letters, `s[::-1]` will also be a string of the same length, containing the same letters in reverse order. 

The expression `s == s[::-1]` will evaluate to `True` if the string `s` is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards) and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if string 's' is a palindrome and False otherwise, where 's' is a non-empty string containing at most 50 lowercase English letters.**
