Correctness: **False**.

The code does not check all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest non-palindromic substring. It only checks the entire string and two substrings that are one character shorter than the entire string. This approach is incomplete and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input string "aaab". The code will return 0 because the entire string is not a palindrome and the two substrings "aaab" (without the first character) and "aaab" (without the last character) are both not checked for being palindromes of length less than the string. However, there is a non-palindromic substring "aab" of length 3, which the code does not consider.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
