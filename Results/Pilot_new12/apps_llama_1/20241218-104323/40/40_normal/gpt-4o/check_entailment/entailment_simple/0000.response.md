Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Handling single character strings**: If the input string `s` has a length of 1 or less, the program prints `0`, which is correct because a single character is always a palindrome.

2. **Checking for palindromes**: The function `func_1(s)` checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). This function works correctly for all non-empty strings containing at most 50 lowercase English letters.

3. **Finding the longest non-palindrome substring**: The main part of the program checks the input string `s` and its substrings to find the longest one that is not a palindrome. It first checks if `s` itself is not a palindrome, in which case it prints the length of `s`. If `s` is a palindrome, it then checks if removing the first or last character results in a non-palindrome substring. If either of these is the case, it prints the length of the resulting substring.

4. **Handling the case when all substrings are palindromes**: If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., `s` and its substrings obtained by removing one character are all palindromes), it prints `0`, indicating that there are no non-palindrome substrings.

The logic of the program follows the problem description closely. It correctly identifies the longest non-palindrome substring (or the absence thereof) within the given string `s`. 

However, it might be argued that the program could be simplified or optimized further to directly find the longest non-palindrome substring without checking `s` and its immediate substrings sequentially. Nonetheless, from a correctness standpoint regarding the problem description, the program behaves as expected.
