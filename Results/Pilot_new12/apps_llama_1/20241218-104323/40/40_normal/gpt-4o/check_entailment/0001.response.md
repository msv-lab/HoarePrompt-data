Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest substring that is not a palindrome. 

For example, if we take the input string "abba", the program will return 3 because it checks if the string itself is a palindrome, then if the string without the first character is a palindrome, and finally if the string without the last character is a palindrome. However, in this case, the longest substring that is not a palindrome is "abb" or "bba" with a length of 3, but the program does not correctly identify this.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks a few specific substrings (the entire string, the string without the first character, and the string without the last character) instead of checking all possible substrings. This means that it may miss the longest substring that is not a palindrome.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible substrings of the input string and keeping track of the longest one that is not a palindrome. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if not is_palindrome(substring):
                max_length = max(max_length, j - i)
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
