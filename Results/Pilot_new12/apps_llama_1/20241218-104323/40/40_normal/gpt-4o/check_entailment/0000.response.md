Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. It only checks the given string and some of its prefixes and suffixes, but it does not check all possible substrings. 

For example, consider the string "ababa". This string is a palindrome, so it should return a non-palindrome substring "aba" with length 3 (or any other non-palindrome substring if it exists). However, the provided program does not correctly identify this substring.

The issue with the program is that it relies on a function `func_1` that checks if a string is a palindrome. It then checks the original string and some of its prefixes and suffixes to find the longest non-palindrome substring. However, this approach is not sufficient, as it does not consider all possible substrings.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check all possible substrings of the given string and return the maximum length of a non-palindrome substring. If no such substring exists, it should return 0. 

Here's an example of a correct approach:

```python
def longest_non_palindrome_substring(s):
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if not is_palindrome(substring):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome_substring(s))
```
