Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

- The program first checks if the length of the input string is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the program prints 0 because a single character or an empty string is a palindrome and does not have any non-palindromic substrings.

- If the string is longer than 1 character, the program checks if the string itself is a palindrome using the `func_1` function. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of the string because the string itself is the longest non-palindromic substring.

- If the string is a palindrome, the program then checks if the string without the first character (`s[1:]`) or without the last character (`s[:-1]`) is a palindrome. If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, the program prints the length of the string minus 1 because the longest non-palindromic substring is the string without the first or last character.

- If all of the above checks pass, it means that the string and all its substrings are palindromes. In this case, the program prints 0 as required by the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description and correctly identifies the longest non-palindromic substring or prints 0 if no such substring exists. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given string is a palindrome or not by comparing the string with its reverse. This function is used throughout the main program to make decisions based on whether a string is a palindrome or not.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description and handles all possible cases as required.
