Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work as expected for every potential case. Although it correctly checks if the input string is a palindrome and if its prefix or suffix (without the first and last characters, respectively) are not palindromes, it fails to cover all possible substrings.

For instance, consider the string "abba". The longest substring that is not a palindrome is "abb" (or "bba"), but the program will not check this correctly because it only checks the string itself, the string without the first character, and the string without the last character.

A correct program should iterate through all possible substrings of the input string and check if any of them are not palindromes. The given program does not do this, so it is incorrect.

Here is a basic example of how a correct program might look:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            substr = s[i:j+1]
            if not is_palindrome(substr):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substr))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```

This program correctly checks all possible substrings of the input string and prints the maximum length of a substring that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, it prints 0.
