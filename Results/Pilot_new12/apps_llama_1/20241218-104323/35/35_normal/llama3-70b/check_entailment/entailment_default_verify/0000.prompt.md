You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the condition that each plate should contain at least one piece of cake and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. The given program tries to find the maximum possible number x such that the sum of pieces of both cakes minus x is greater than or equal to x, but it does not guarantee that each plate will have at least x pieces of cake.

For example, if we input `n = 3`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the program will output `1` because it finds that `x` can be `1` and the sum of pieces of both cakes minus `x` is greater than `x`. However, this does not meet the condition that each plate should have at least `x` pieces of cake, because we cannot distribute `4` and `5` pieces into `3` plates such that each plate has at least `1` piece of cake and no plate has pieces of both cakes.

A correct solution would involve finding the maximum possible number x such that we can distribute the pieces of both cakes into n plates, each containing at least x pieces of cake, and no plate containing pieces of both cakes. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible values of x and checking if we can distribute the pieces of both cakes into n plates according to the given conditions.

Here is a possible correct solution:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(a, b)
    while x > 0:
        plates_with_a = a // x
        plates_with_b = b // x
        if plates_with_a + plates_with_b <= n and a % x == 0 and b % x == 0:
            print(x)
            break
        x -= 1
    else:
        print(1)  # or handle this case accordingly

```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints the largest value `x` less than or equal to the minimum of three input integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, such that `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` are all true. The function accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`, and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that the value of `x` is printed to the console, and the original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are retained. The function does not return any value other than printing `x`, and it does not modify the input variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function will continue to decrement `x` until it finds a value that satisfies the conditions `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, at which point it will print `x` and terminate.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
