Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the condition that each plate should contain at least one piece of cake and that no plate contains pieces of both cakes. The given program tries to find the maximum possible number x such that the sum of pieces of both cakes minus x is greater than or equal to x, but it does not guarantee that each plate will have at least x pieces of cake.

For example, if we input `n = 3`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the program will output `1` because it finds that `x` can be `1` and the sum of pieces of both cakes minus `x` is greater than `x`. However, this does not meet the condition that each plate should have at least `x` pieces of cake, because we cannot distribute `4` and `5` pieces into `3` plates such that each plate has at least `1` piece of cake and no plate has pieces of both cakes.

A correct solution would involve finding the maximum possible number x such that we can distribute the pieces of both cakes into n plates, each containing at least x pieces of cake, and no plate containing pieces of both cakes. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible values of x and checking if we can distribute the pieces of both cakes into n plates according to the given conditions.

Here is a possible correct solution:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(a, b)
    while x > 0:
        plates_with_a = a // x
        plates_with_b = b // x
        if plates_with_a + plates_with_b <= n and a % x == 0 and b % x == 0:
            print(x)
            break
        x -= 1
    else:
        print(1)  # or handle this case accordingly

```
