Correctness: **False** 

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires that each plate should contain at least one piece of cake and no plate should contain pieces of both cakes. The program does not consider all possible distributions of cakes to plates. 

For example, if we consider the input `4 7 10`, the correct output should be `3` as mentioned in the examples. However, if we analyze the condition in the while loop, it seems like the program is trying to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. But, the condition `a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x)` does not cover all possible cases.

The issue in this program is that it doesn't check all possible combinations of distributing `a` and `b` pieces to `n` plates. A correct solution would use a different approach, such as iterating over all possible values of `x` and checking if it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

Here is a correct Python program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    max_x = min(a, b)
    for x in range(max_x, 0, -1):
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if x * i <= a and x * (n - i) <= b:
                print(x)
                return
    print(0)

func()
```
This program checks all possible combinations of distributing `a` and `b` pieces to `n` plates and prints the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake.
