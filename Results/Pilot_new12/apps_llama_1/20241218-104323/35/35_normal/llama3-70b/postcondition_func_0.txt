The function calculates and prints the largest value `x` less than or equal to the minimum of three input integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, such that `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` are all true. The function accepts three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`, and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that the value of `x` is printed to the console, and the original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are retained. The function does not return any value other than printing `x`, and it does not modify the input variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function will continue to decrement `x` until it finds a value that satisfies the conditions `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`, at which point it will print `x` and terminate.
