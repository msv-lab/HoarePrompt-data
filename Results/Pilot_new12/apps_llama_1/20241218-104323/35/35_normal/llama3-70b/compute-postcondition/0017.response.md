The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. However, the provided information does not specify the return value of the function. 

To complete the task, the return value or the specific conditions that determine the return value should be provided. Since the output section is empty, I will assume a general return based on typical scenarios involving such constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are integers, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, but the specific return value or conditions are not defined.**
