The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. So, the new value of `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 1. If `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to `x`+1 and the sum of the differences between `a` and `x`+1 and between `b` and `x`+1 is greater than or equal to `x`+1, then we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their input integer values and `x` was the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` before decrement.**
