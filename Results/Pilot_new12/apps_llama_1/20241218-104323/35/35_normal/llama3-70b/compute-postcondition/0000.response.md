To calculate the output state, let's consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part into an integer using `map(int,...)`, and assigns these values to `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively.

Given the initial state that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`, and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, let's examine how this code affects these variables:

1. **Input from User**: The code takes an input that is split into three integers. This input is not constrained by the initial state conditions (`1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`, and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`) because it directly overrides the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` with the user-provided input.

2. **Assignment**: The values read from the input are assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the initial constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b` no longer apply after the execution of this line of code because `n`, `a`, and `b` can now take any integer value provided by the user, not necessarily adhering to the initial constraints.

However, since the input is expected to be three integers and is directly assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`, we can conclude that:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the integer values provided by the user.
- The constraints `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` from the initial state are no longer guaranteed to hold because the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the user's input, not by the initial conditions.

Thus, the output state, considering the provided code and initial conditions, is that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as input by the user.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers**
