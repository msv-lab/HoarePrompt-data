According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop. This means that the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will execute again regardless of the current state of the variables.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 2**
