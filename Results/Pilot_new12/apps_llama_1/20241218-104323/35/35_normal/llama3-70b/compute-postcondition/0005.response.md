Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to `x` and the sum of the differences between `a` and `x` and between `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their input integer values and `x` remaining the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.***
