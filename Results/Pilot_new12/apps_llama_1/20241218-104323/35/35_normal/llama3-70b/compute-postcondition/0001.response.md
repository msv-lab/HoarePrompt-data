The value of `x` is assigned the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
