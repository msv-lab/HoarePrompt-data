Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 2. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x` and `b` is greater than or equal to `x` and the sum of the differences between `a` and `x` and between `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
