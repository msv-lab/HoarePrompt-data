The initial state provides that `low` equals `high`, and the value of `low` (or `high`) is the threshold value for the `can_distribute` function. Since `low` equals `high`, we are essentially dealing with a single value that represents both the low and high threshold. 

Given the code `return low - 1`, we are subtracting 1 from this threshold value.

Output State: **The program returns the threshold value for the `can_distribute` function minus 1**
