The value of `mid` is assigned the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2, effectively calculating the midpoint between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The precondition that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b` remains valid. 

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `mid` is the integer midpoint of `low` and `high`, and `low` must be less than `high` after the update, considering `high` could be the midpoint when `can_distribute(mid)` is False.**
