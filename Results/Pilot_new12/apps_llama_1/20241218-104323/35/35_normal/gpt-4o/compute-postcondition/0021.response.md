Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters, `n`, `a`, and `b`, representing the number of plates and the pieces of two cakes, respectively, and returns the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed to each plate such that the `can_distribute` function returns False, minus 1. The function assumes that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, and it does not modify the input parameters `n`, `a`, or `b`. The returned value is calculated using a binary search algorithm, where the search space is initially set to the range `[1, min(a, b) + 1]`, and the `can_distribute` function is used to determine the threshold value. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are at their minimum or maximum values, and where `n` is at its minimum or maximum value relative to `a` and `b`. However, the function does not handle cases where `n`, `a`, or `b` are outside their specified ranges, or where the `can_distribute` function does not have a well-defined threshold value.**
