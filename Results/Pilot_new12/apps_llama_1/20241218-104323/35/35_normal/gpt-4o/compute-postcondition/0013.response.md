To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `low < high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` = `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. This means `low` is updated to be at least one more than the midpoint of `low` and `high`. However, there's no guarantee that `high` ≥ `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, which could potentially make `mid` = `(low + high) // 2` invalid for the next iteration.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, then `low` < `high`, and `high` = `(low + high) // 2`, which simplifies to `high` = `mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low < high` must hold true. Given the updates:
- When `can_distribute(mid)` is True, `low` increases, and there's no direct adjustment to `high` mentioned in this scenario that would ensure `low < high` for the next iteration. However, the key here is that `low` is updated based on the average of `low` and `high`, plus one, which doesn't directly affect the condition for the next iteration without knowing how `high` is adjusted or if it remains unchanged.
- When `can_distribute(mid)` is False, `high` becomes `mid`, which is the average of `low` and the old `high`. For the loop to continue, `low` must remain less than `high`, and since `high` is now `mid`, we must ensure that `low` < `mid` for the loop to potentially execute again.

Given these scenarios, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the adjustments needed focus on maintaining the inequality `low < high`. The information provided doesn't explicitly describe how `high` is adjusted when `can_distribute(mid)` is True in a way that guarantees `low < high`, but it does imply that when `can_distribute(mid)` is False, `high` becomes the midpoint, suggesting that `low` must be less than this new `high` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, without explicit adjustments to `high` when `can_distribute(mid)` is True, but understanding that `low` must be less than `high` for the loop to execute again, the necessary adjustment focuses on ensuring this inequality holds, given the operations described.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, and `low` must be less than `high` after the update, considering `high` could be the midpoint when `can_distribute(mid)` is False.**
