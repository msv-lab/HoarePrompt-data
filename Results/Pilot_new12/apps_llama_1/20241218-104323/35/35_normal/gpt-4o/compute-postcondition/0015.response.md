The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `mid` is the integer midpoint of the original `low` and `high`, and `low` is now `mid + 1`, which must be less than `high` after the update.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `mid` is the integer midpoint of the original `low` and `high`, `low` is `mid + 1`, and `low` < `high`.**
