Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` = `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, and the relationship `high` ≥ `(low + high) // 2 + 1` is not guaranteed, making `mid` = `(low + high) // 2` invalid. If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, then `low` < `high`, and `high` = `(low + high) // 2`, which simplifies to `high` = `mid`.***
