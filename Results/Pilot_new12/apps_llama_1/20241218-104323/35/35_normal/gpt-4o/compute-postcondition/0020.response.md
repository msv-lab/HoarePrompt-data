The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where `n` represents the number of plates, and `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces of two cakes, respectively. The constraints on these parameters are such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. The function returns the threshold value for the `can_distribute` function minus 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, which represent the number of plates and the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns the threshold value for the can_distribute function minus 1.**
