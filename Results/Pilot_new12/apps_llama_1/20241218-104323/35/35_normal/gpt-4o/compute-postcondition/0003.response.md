Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. The current value of `mid` has the property that `can_distribute(mid)` is True, meaning that distribution at the midpoint value is possible.**
