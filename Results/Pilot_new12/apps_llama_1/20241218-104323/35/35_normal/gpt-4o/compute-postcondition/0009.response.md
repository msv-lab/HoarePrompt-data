To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the Initial State: 
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers.
- The range of `a` and `b` is 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100.
- The range of `n` is 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
- `low` and `high` are such that `low` < `high` and `high` ≥ `low` + 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

From the code, we can see that `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Given that `low` must be less than `high`, and `high` must be at least `low + 1`, the smallest possible difference between `high` and `low` is 1. This means `mid` will be the integer part of the average of `low` and `high`, effectively rounding down if the sum of `low` and `high` is odd.

Let's denote the initial values of `low` and `high` as `low_init` and `high_init`, respectively. After the update, `mid` equals `(low_init + high_init) // 2`.

Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are not updated in the code snippet, their conditions and ranges remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
- `low` and `high` maintain their relationship where `low` < `high` and `high` ≥ `low` + 1.
- `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, which is the integer average of `low` and `high`, rounding down if their sum is odd.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` < `high`, `high` ≥ `low` + 1, and `mid` = `(low + high) // 2`.**
