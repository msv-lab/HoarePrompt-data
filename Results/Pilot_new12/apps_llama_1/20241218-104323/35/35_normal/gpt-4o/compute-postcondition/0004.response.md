To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program's state.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
- `low` is 1.
- `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`.
- `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`.
- The current value of `mid` has the property that `can_distribute(mid)` is True.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
low = mid + 1
```

This line of code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1`. 

Since `mid` is an integer and is calculated as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, let's consider the properties of `min(a, b)` to understand the range of `mid` and consequently `low`.

- The minimum value of `min(a, b)` is 1 (since 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100), making the minimum `mid` value `(1 + 2) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1` (integer division in Python).
- The maximum value of `min(a, b)` is 100, making the maximum `mid` value `(100 + 2) // 2 = 102 // 2 = 51`.

However, since `high` is defined as `min(a, b) + 1`, and we know `low` was initially 1, the range of `mid` and the subsequent update of `low` is constrained within the bounds of `low` and `high`. 

Given that `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and knowing that `mid` is at least 1 (from the minimum calculation), `low` will be at least 2 after the update.

The states of `n`, `a`, `b`, `high`, and `mid` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is `mid + 1` which equals `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`.**
