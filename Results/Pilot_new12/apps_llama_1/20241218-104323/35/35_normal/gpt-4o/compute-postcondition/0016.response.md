The value of `high` is updated to be `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `high` could be the midpoint when `can_distribute(mid)` is False, and `low` must be less than `high` after the update, we know that `low` is still less than `mid` (the new `high`). 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `mid` is the integer midpoint of `low` and `high`, `high` is equal to `mid`, and `low` is less than `high`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `mid` is the integer midpoint of `low` and `high`, `high` = `mid`, and `low` < `high`**
