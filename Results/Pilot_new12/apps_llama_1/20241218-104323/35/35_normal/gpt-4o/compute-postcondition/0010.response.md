The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. After the update, `low` is `mid + 1`, which is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` = `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` ≥ `low` + 1 is not valid anymore since `low` is now `(low + high) // 2 + 1` and `high` ≥ `(low + high) // 2 + 1` + 1 is not guaranteed, `mid` = `(low + high) // 2` is also not valid anymore because `low` has changed.

Since `low` = `mid + 1` = `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, we can say `low` > `mid`. Also, given `low` < `high` initially and `low` has increased, we can't conclude `low` < `high` or `low` ≥ `high`. But `high` ≥ `low` + 1 is not guaranteed.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` = `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` ≥ `(low + high) // 2 + 1` is not guaranteed, `mid` = `(low + high) // 2` is not valid anymore**
