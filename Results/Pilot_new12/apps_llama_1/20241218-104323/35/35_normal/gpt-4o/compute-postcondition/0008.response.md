To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop, which is `low < high`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid`.
- In both cases, `mid` remains `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low < high` must still be true after the adjustments. 

Considering the updates:
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, `low` becomes `mid + 1`.
- If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, `high` becomes `mid`.

However, the key factor here is the relationship between `low` and `high` and how `mid` is calculated as `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. 

Since `mid` remains constant at `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and considering the updates of `low` and `high` based on the value of `can_distribute(mid)`, for the loop to continue, we must ensure that `low` is less than `high` after these updates.

The condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again is that `low` must be less than `high`. Given that `low` could be updated to `mid + 1` if `can_distribute(mid)` is True, or `high` could be updated to `mid` if `can_distribute(mid)` is False, the only way to guarantee another iteration is to ensure that `low` is updated in such a way that it remains less than `high`, or `high` is updated in a manner that it remains greater than `low`.

Therefore, considering the calculation of `mid` and the potential updates of `low` and `high`, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure the difference between `high` and `low` allows for at least one more iteration. This means `high` should be at least `low + 1` after any update for the loop condition to hold true for another iteration.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, and after the updates, `low` must be less than `high`, with `high` being at least `low + 1`.**
