Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `low` is less than `high`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, then `high` is updated to `mid` and `low` is less than `high`, with `mid` being the integer midpoint of the original `low` and `high`.***
