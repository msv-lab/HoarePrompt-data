The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. The value of `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, so `high` becomes `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `low` is 1, `high` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and it is not possible to distribute using `mid`**
