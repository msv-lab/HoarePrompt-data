Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid`. In both cases, `mid` remains `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and the initial values of `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the outcome of `can_distribute(mid)`.***
