You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the `can_distribute` function and the way it is used in `func_1`. 

The `can_distribute` function checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake from both cakes is greater than or equal to the total number of plates `n`. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that the number of plates filled with pieces from each cake can be determined independently.

A correct solution would involve finding the maximum `x` such that it is possible to distribute `a` pieces of one cake and `b` pieces of another cake into `n` plates, with each plate containing at least `x` pieces and no plate containing pieces from both cakes.

To demonstrate the incorrectness, consider the following example:

Input: 4 4 4

The given program will return 2, but the correct answer is 2. However, a better example to demonstrate the incorrectness is:

Input: 6 3 9

In this case, the correct answer should be 2 because we can distribute the first cake into 3 plates with 1 piece each and the second cake into 3 plates with 3 pieces each. However, the given program may not return the correct answer for all possible inputs.

The issue can be resolved by implementing a correct algorithm that checks all possible combinations of distributions for the two cakes. This could involve iterating over all possible numbers of plates filled with pieces from each cake and checking if it is possible to distribute the pieces in such a way that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

Here's a possible correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    for x in range(min(a, b), 0, -1):
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a >= x * i and b >= x * (n - i):
                return x
    return 1

# Test the function
print(func_1(5, 2, 3))  # Output: 1
print(func_1(4, 7, 10))  # Output: 3
```

This implementation checks all possible combinations of distributions for the two cakes and returns the maximum `x` for which it is possible to distribute the pieces in such a way that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `can_distribute` determines whether it's possible to distribute items represented by the sum of integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x`, where `a`, `b`, `x`, and `n` are positive integers, and `n` is between 2 and `a + b`, and returns `True` if the sum of these divisions is greater than or equal to `n`, and `False` otherwise. However, the provided code seems to have missing logic as it does not explicitly accept parameters `a`, `b`, and `n` as stated in the overall function description. The actual code only accepts `x` as a parameter, suggesting that `a`, `b`, and `n` might be global variables or predefined constants in the scope of the function, which could lead to potential issues if these variables are not properly initialized or modified elsewhere in the program. The function performs a simple arithmetic comparison after the integer divisions and returns a boolean value based on this comparison. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to the division by zero (which is not possible given that `x` is a positive integer), but it does implicitly assume that `a`, `b`, and `n` are within the specified ranges, potentially leading to incorrect results if these conditions are not met.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
