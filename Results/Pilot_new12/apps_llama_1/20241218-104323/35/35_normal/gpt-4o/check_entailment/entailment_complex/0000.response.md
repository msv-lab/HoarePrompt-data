Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The `func_1` function uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed to each plate, and the `can_distribute` function checks whether it's possible to distribute the pieces in a way that satisfies the conditions.

The annotations provided help to understand the code better, and they agree with the code. The `can_distribute` function takes a single parameter `x`, but `a`, `b`, and `n` are global variables that are initialized before the function is called. This might not be the best practice, but it works in this case since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The problem description provides examples that can be used to test the code, and the code produces the correct output for these examples. For instance, when the input is `5 2 3`, the output is `1`, and when the input is `4 7 10`, the output is `3`, which agrees with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, annotations, and problem description, it appears that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
