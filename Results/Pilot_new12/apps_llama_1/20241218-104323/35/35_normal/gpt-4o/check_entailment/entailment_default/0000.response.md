Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because the function `can_distribute(x)` is using the global variables `a`, `b`, and `n` instead of accepting them as parameters. This can lead to incorrect results if these variables are not properly initialized or modified elsewhere in the program.

Another issue is that the function `can_distribute(x)` is checking if the sum of the integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. The condition should also consider the distribution of the pieces on each plate to ensure that no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

For example, if we have `n = 4`, `a = 7`, and `b = 10`, the function `func_1(n, a, b)` may return `3`, but the distribution of pieces on each plate may not be possible such that each plate contains at least `3` pieces of cake and no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

To fix these issues, the function `can_distribute(x)` should be modified to accept `a`, `b`, and `n` as parameters and to correctly check the distribution of pieces on each plate. 

Here is an example of how the function `can_distribute(x)` can be modified:
```python
def can_distribute(x, a, b, n):
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a >= i * x and b >= (n - i) * x:
            return True
        if b >= i * x and a >= (n - i) * x:
            return True
    return False
```
And the function `func_1(n, a, b)` should be modified to pass `a`, `b`, and `n` to the function `can_distribute(x)`:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid, a, b, n):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
```
