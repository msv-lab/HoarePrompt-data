You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Functions with output description for each function:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts three integer parameters, `n`, `a`, and `b`, representing the number of plates and the pieces of two cakes, respectively, and returns the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed to each plate such that the `can_distribute` function returns False, minus 1. The function assumes that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, and it does not modify the input parameters `n`, `a`, or `b`. The returned value is calculated using a binary search algorithm, where the search space is initially set to the range `[1, min(a, b) + 1]`, and the `can_distribute` function is used to determine the threshold value. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are at their minimum or maximum values, and where `n` is at its minimum or maximum value relative to `a` and `b`. However, the function does not handle cases where `n`, `a`, or `b` are outside their specified ranges, or where the `can_distribute` function does not have a well-defined threshold value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_distribute` determines whether it's possible to distribute items represented by the sum of integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x`, where `a`, `b`, `x`, and `n` are positive integers, and `n` is between 2 and `a + b`, and returns `True` if the sum of these divisions is greater than or equal to `n`, and `False` otherwise. However, the provided code seems to have missing logic as it does not explicitly accept parameters `a`, `b`, and `n` as stated in the overall function description. The actual code only accepts `x` as a parameter, suggesting that `a`, `b`, and `n` might be global variables or predefined constants in the scope of the function, which could lead to potential issues if these variables are not properly initialized or modified elsewhere in the program. The function performs a simple arithmetic comparison after the integer divisions and returns a boolean value based on this comparison. It does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to the division by zero (which is not possible given that `x` is a positive integer), but it does implicitly assume that `a`, `b`, and `n` are within the specified ranges, potentially leading to incorrect results if these conditions are not met.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
