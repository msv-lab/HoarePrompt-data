Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks to find the maximum possible number `x` such that when distributing two types of cakes (with `a` and `b` pieces respectively) onto `n` plates, each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake, with no plate containing pieces of both cakes.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x`. It starts by considering a range from 1 to the minimum of `a` and `b` (inclusive) as potential values for `x`.
   - The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces. It does this by checking if the sum of the integer divisions of `a` by `x` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. This essentially verifies if there are enough pieces in each cake to meet the condition of having at least `x` pieces on each plate when distributed exclusively (i.e., no mixing of cakes on a plate).
   - The binary search in `func_1(n, a, b)` iteratively narrows down the possible range for `x`. If `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`, it means `x` is a potential candidate, so it tries to increase `x` by setting `low` to `mid + 1`. If `can_distribute(x)` returns `False`, it means `x` is too high, so it decreases the upper bound by setting `high` to `mid`.
   - The loop continues until `low` equals `high`, at which point `low - 1` gives the maximum `x` for which the distribution is possible. This is because the last successful `x` value (where `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`) before the loop ends is the highest achievable `x`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program's assumption that the input is valid (i.e., `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`) is in line with the problem description, making it correct under these constraints.
   - The use of binary search is efficient for finding the maximum `x`, and the `can_distribute` function accurately models the condition for successful distribution as per the problem.
   - The logic of adjusting `low` and `high` in the binary search ensures that the program converges on the correct maximum value of `x`.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program correctly determines the maximum possible number `x` such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions, confirming that the program follows the problem description accurately.
