Correctness: **False**

The problem with the given code is in the `can_distribute` function. This function checks if the sum of integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach does not correctly model the problem because it does not consider the condition that no plate can contain pieces of both cakes.

A correct approach would be to check if it's possible to distribute the pieces of the first cake among some plates, such that each of these plates gets at least `x` pieces, and then distribute the pieces of the second cake among the remaining plates, such that each of these plates gets at least `x` pieces.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly: 

Input: 
4 4 4

The program will output 2, which is incorrect. A correct distribution would be to put 2 pieces of the first cake on each of two plates and 2 pieces of the second cake on each of the other two plates, resulting in a minimum of 2 pieces per plate. However, the program should output 2, which means it should be able to find a distribution where each plate gets at least 2 pieces of cake.

The provided code does not handle this case correctly because the `can_distribute` function does not consider the distribution of the two cakes separately. 

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to consider the distribution of the two cakes separately. Here's a possible modification:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(n, a, b, mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(n, a, b, x):
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a >= i * x and b >= (n - i) * x:
            return True
    return False
```

This code checks for each possible number of plates with the first cake whether it's possible to distribute the pieces of the first cake among these plates, such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces, and whether it's possible to distribute the pieces of the second cake among the remaining plates, such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces. If it finds such a distribution, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
