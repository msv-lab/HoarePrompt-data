You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`.
2. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4, which is the number of unique nucleotides.
3. The program adjusts the count of each nucleotide to the average count minus the current count, which gives the number of unknown nucleotides (`'?'`) that need to be replaced with each type of nucleotide.
4. The program iterates through the input string `s` and replaces each unknown nucleotide (`'?'`) with the first type of nucleotide that has a positive count.
5. Finally, the program checks if there are any remaining counts of nucleotides that are not zero. If there are, it prints `'==='`, indicating that it's not possible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly:

* If the genome is already decoded, the program simply prints the original string.
* If the genome can be decoded by replacing unknown nucleotides, the program prints the decoded genome.
* If the genome cannot be decoded, the program prints `'==='`.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to follow the problem description and handles all possible inputs correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of `count[c]` is the total count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `s`, ignoring any '?' characters.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is 'T', `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - original_count[c]`.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the pattern observed from the output states after executing the loop a few times.
    #
    #1. **Variable `n`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. It is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive).
    #
    #2. **Variable `s`**: This is a string, and its content does not change within the loop; it is the source of characters that the loop iterates over. The loop's execution does not alter `s` itself.
    #
    #3. **Variable `c`**: After the loop finishes executing, `c` will hold the last character of `s` that was processed, which could be either one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or '?' if `s` ends with it.
    #
    #4. **Variable `avg`**: Like `n`, `avg` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. It was initialized to `n // 4`.
    #
    #5. **Variable `count`**: This dictionary initially contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each value set to `n // 4 - original_count[c]`. During each iteration, if a character `c` from `s` is '?', the loop checks the `count` dictionary for any nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count greater than 0, appends the first such nucleotide found to `res`, and then decrements its count by 1. If `c` is not '?', it directly appends `c` to `res` without altering the `count` dictionary. After all iterations, the `count` dictionary will reflect the updated counts based on how many times each nucleotide was added to `res` in place of '?'.
    #
    #6. **Variable `res`**: This starts as an empty string. For each character in `s`, if the character is '?', the first available nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') based on the `count` dictionary (i.e., the one with a count greater than 0) is appended to `res`, and its count is decremented. If no nucleotide has a count greater than 0, `res` remains unchanged for that iteration. If the character from `s` is not '?', it is directly appended to `res`. After all iterations, `res` will be a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on availability in `count`, and all non-'?' characters from `s` have been appended as is.
    #
    #**Output State**: 
    #**`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the original string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on replacements made for '?' in `s`, and `res` is a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by available nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary, and all non-'?' characters from `s` are appended as is.**
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the original string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on replacements made for '?' in `s`, and `res` is a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by available nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary, and all non-'?' characters from `s` are appended as is. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `res` has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
