You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly attempts to replace the unrecognized nucleotides in the genome with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.

Here's an explanation of why the program works:

1.  It first counts the initial occurrences of each nucleotide type in the genome.
2.  Then it calculates the target count for each type, which is the average of the total length of the genome divided by 4 (since there are four types).
3.  The program then iterates through the genome. When it encounters an unrecognized nucleotide ('?'), it replaces it with the first type that has a remaining target count greater than 0. This ensures that the replaced nucleotide is one of the four types and that its count does not exceed the target count.
4.  Finally, the program checks if any of the target counts are still greater than 0 after replacing all the unrecognized nucleotides. If so, it means that the genome cannot be decoded to have equal counts of each type, and it prints "===".

The program handles all the provided examples correctly. For instance, in the example "AG?C??CT", it replaces the unrecognized nucleotides with 'A', 'G', and 'T' to get the decoded genome "AGACGTCT".

It also correctly handles edge cases like an already decoded genome ("AGCT"), a genome that cannot be decoded ("AAAA" or "????G?").

Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases and does what the problem description requires. Therefore, its correctness is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lines of input, an integer n and a string s, where n represents the length of the genome and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It then processes this input to produce a string where all '?' in s have been replaced by the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in a way that each nucleotide appears as close to n/4 times as possible, while preserving the order of non-'?' characters. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0 after replacement, it prints '===', otherwise, it prints the resulting string. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format, such as non-integer values for n, strings of length not equal to n, or characters in s other than 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
