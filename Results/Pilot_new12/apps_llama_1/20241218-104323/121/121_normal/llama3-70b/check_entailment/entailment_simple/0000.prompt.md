You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of `count[c]` is the total count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in `s`, ignoring any '?' characters.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is 'T', `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - original_count[c]`.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the pattern observed from the output states after executing the loop a few times.
    #
    #1. **Variable `n`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. It is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive).
    #
    #2. **Variable `s`**: This is a string, and its content does not change within the loop; it is the source of characters that the loop iterates over. The loop's execution does not alter `s` itself.
    #
    #3. **Variable `c`**: After the loop finishes executing, `c` will hold the last character of `s` that was processed, which could be either one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or '?' if `s` ends with it.
    #
    #4. **Variable `avg`**: Like `n`, `avg` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. It was initialized to `n // 4`.
    #
    #5. **Variable `count`**: This dictionary initially contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with each value set to `n // 4 - original_count[c]`. During each iteration, if a character `c` from `s` is '?', the loop checks the `count` dictionary for any nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count greater than 0, appends the first such nucleotide found to `res`, and then decrements its count by 1. If `c` is not '?', it directly appends `c` to `res` without altering the `count` dictionary. After all iterations, the `count` dictionary will reflect the updated counts based on how many times each nucleotide was added to `res` in place of '?'.
    #
    #6. **Variable `res`**: This starts as an empty string. For each character in `s`, if the character is '?', the first available nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') based on the `count` dictionary (i.e., the one with a count greater than 0) is appended to `res`, and its count is decremented. If no nucleotide has a count greater than 0, `res` remains unchanged for that iteration. If the character from `s` is not '?', it is directly appended to `res`. After all iterations, `res` will be a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on availability in `count`, and all non-'?' characters from `s` have been appended as is.
    #
    #**Output State**: 
    #**`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the original string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on replacements made for '?' in `s`, and `res` is a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by available nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary, and all non-'?' characters from `s` are appended as is.**
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the original string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on replacements made for '?' in `s`, and `res` is a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by available nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary, and all non-'?' characters from `s` are appended as is. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `res` has been printed to the console.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
