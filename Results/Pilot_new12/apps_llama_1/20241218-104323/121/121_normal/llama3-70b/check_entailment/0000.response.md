Correctness: **True**

The program correctly attempts to replace the unrecognized nucleotides in the genome with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.

Here's an explanation of why the program works:

1.  It first counts the initial occurrences of each nucleotide type in the genome.
2.  Then it calculates the target count for each type, which is the average of the total length of the genome divided by 4 (since there are four types).
3.  The program then iterates through the genome. When it encounters an unrecognized nucleotide ('?'), it replaces it with the first type that has a remaining target count greater than 0. This ensures that the replaced nucleotide is one of the four types and that its count does not exceed the target count.
4.  Finally, the program checks if any of the target counts are still greater than 0 after replacing all the unrecognized nucleotides. If so, it means that the genome cannot be decoded to have equal counts of each type, and it prints "===".

The program handles all the provided examples correctly. For instance, in the example "AG?C??CT", it replaces the unrecognized nucleotides with 'A', 'G', and 'T' to get the decoded genome "AGACGTCT".

It also correctly handles edge cases like an already decoded genome ("AGCT"), a genome that cannot be decoded ("AAAA" or "????G?").

Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases and does what the problem description requires. Therefore, its correctness is True.
