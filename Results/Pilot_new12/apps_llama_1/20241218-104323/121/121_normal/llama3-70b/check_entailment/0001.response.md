Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`.
2. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4, which is the number of unique nucleotides.
3. The program adjusts the count of each nucleotide to the average count minus the current count, which gives the number of unknown nucleotides (`'?'`) that need to be replaced with each type of nucleotide.
4. The program iterates through the input string `s` and replaces each unknown nucleotide (`'?'`) with the first type of nucleotide that has a positive count.
5. Finally, the program checks if there are any remaining counts of nucleotides that are not zero. If there are, it prints `'==='`, indicating that it's not possible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly:

* If the genome is already decoded, the program simply prints the original string.
* If the genome can be decoded by replacing unknown nucleotides, the program prints the decoded genome.
* If the genome cannot be decoded, the program prints `'==='`.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to follow the problem description and handles all possible inputs correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
