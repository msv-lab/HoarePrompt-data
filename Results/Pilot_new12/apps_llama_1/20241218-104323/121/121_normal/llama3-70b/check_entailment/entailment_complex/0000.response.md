Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `n` represents the length of the genome and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**: It then initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s`, ignoring the '?' characters.

3. **Calculating Average Count**: The program calculates the average count of each nucleotide by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4. This is because the problem statement requires that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome should be equal.

4. **Replacing '?' Characters**: The program then iterates over the string `s`. If it encounters a '?' character, it replaces it with the first available nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count greater than 0 in the `count` dictionary. The count of the replaced nucleotide is then decremented by 1.

5. **Output**: After replacing all '?' characters, the program checks if there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0 in the `count` dictionary. If there are, it means that it's not possible to decode the genome such that the number of nucleotides of each type is equal, so it prints '==='. Otherwise, it prints the resulting string where all '?' characters have been replaced.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, and it does not rely on any assumptions beyond the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the average count of each nucleotide, replaces the '?' characters accordingly, and outputs the result or an error message as required. 

For example, in the case of the input "8" and "AG?C??CT", the program correctly replaces the '?' characters to output "AGACGTCT". Similarly, in the case of the input "4" and "AGCT", the program outputs "AGCT" as the genome is already decoded correctly. In cases where it's not possible to decode the genome, such as the input "6" and "????G?" or "4" and "AA??", the program correctly outputs "===".

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
