Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input, where `n` represents the length of the genome and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The code then processes this input to produce a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in a way that each nucleotide appears as close to `n/4` times as possible, while preserving the order of non-'?' characters. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0 after replacement, it prints '===', otherwise, it prints the resulting string.

The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the average count of each nucleotide, replaces '?' with the nucleotides in the order they are needed, and checks for any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0. The code also produces the correct output for all examples provided in the problem description.

Assuming the input will always be valid, the code does not need to handle cases where the input may not match the expected format, such as non-integer values for `n`, strings of length not equal to `n`, or characters in `s` other than 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. 

Therefore, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
