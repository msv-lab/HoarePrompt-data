The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or the innermost enclosing loop or switch statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, `nc`, `res`, and `count['C']` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'C', `res` is the initial value of `res` plus 'C', `count['C']` is decreased by 1 from its initial value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
