Functionality: **The function accepts two lines of input, an integer n and a string s, where n represents the length of the genome and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It then processes this input to produce a string where all '?' in s have been replaced by the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in a way that each nucleotide appears as close to n/4 times as possible, while preserving the order of non-'?' characters. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0 after replacement, it prints '===', otherwise, it prints the resulting string. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format, such as non-integer values for n, strings of length not equal to n, or characters in s other than 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
