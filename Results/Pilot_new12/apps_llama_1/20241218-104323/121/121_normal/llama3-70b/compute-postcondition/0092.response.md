Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the original string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the last character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on replacements made for '?' in `s`, and `res` is a string where all '?' in `s` have been replaced by available nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary, and all non-'?' characters from `s` are appended as is. If there are any remaining nucleotides with counts greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `res` has been printed to the console.***
