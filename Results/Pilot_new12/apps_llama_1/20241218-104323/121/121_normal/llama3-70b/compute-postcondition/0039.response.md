The `break` statement terminates the loop it is inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`, `nc` is 'G', `count['G']` is `n // 4 - original_count['G'] - 1`, the conditions for `count['A']`, `count['C']`, and `count['T']` remain as initially specified, `res` is either 'AG' or 'ACG', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
