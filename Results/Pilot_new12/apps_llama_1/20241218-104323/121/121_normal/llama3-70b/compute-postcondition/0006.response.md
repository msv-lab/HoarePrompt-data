Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the string `s`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where if `c` is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then the value of `count[c]` is incremented by 1, otherwise the dictionary remains unchanged with all values being 0.**
