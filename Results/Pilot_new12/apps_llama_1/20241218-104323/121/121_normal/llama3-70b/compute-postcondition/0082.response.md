Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `res` is its previous value plus 'G', `count['G']` is decreased by 1 from its initial value.***
