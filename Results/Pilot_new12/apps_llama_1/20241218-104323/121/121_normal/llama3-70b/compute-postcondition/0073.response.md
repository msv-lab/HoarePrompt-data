According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string 'ACGT'. The loop iterates over each character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `nc` must have been 'A', 'n' is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`. For the loop to execute again, `nc` must be the next character in the string 'ACGT', which is 'C'. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'C'**
