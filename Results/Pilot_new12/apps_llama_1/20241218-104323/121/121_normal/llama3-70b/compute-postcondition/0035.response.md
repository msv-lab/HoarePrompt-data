Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is '?', `avg` is `n // 4`, if `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['A']` is `n // 4 - original_count['A'] - 1` and `count['A']` is greater than or equal to 0, if `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C'] - 1` and `res` is 'AC', otherwise `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C']` and `res` remains 'A', and for 'G', 'T', each `count[c]` is `n // 4 - original_count[c]`, `nc` is 'C'***
