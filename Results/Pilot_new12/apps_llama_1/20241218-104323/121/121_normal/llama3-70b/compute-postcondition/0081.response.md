The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest loop or conditional statement. When the `break` statement is encountered, the program will immediately exit the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. 

In the given code, there are no changes made to the variables, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'G', `res` is its previous value plus 'G', `count['G']` is decreased by 1 from its initial value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
