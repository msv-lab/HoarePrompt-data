According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, so for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character. Since we are iterating over each character in `s`, the loop will move to the next character. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`**
