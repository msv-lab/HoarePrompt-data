The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it uses two lines of input, the first line being an integer `n` where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and the second line being a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. 

Since there is no specified output for this function, I will assume that the task is to determine the functionality based on typical operations involving genome strings and their lengths.

However, given the strict format requirement and the information provided, the correct interpretation of the task should focus on the input parameters and the general nature of the function's operation.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lines of input, an integer n and a string s, where n represents the length of the genome and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and it operates on this input to produce an unspecified output.**
