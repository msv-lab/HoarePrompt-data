The code `res += c` appends the character `c` to the end of the string `res`. 

Given that `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s` and `c` is not equal to '?', `count` and `res` are updated based on the rules for the new `c`.

The value of `res` is updated by appending `c` to it. The values of `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, and `count` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s` and `c` is not equal to '?', `count` is unchanged, `res` is updated to `res + c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s` and `c` is not equal to '?', `count` is unchanged, `res` is `res + c`**
