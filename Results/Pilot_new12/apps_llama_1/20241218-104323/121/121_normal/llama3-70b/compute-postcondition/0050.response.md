The break statement does not change the values of any variables, it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with `count[nc]` greater than or equal to 0, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus the current value of `nc`, and `nc` iterates over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
