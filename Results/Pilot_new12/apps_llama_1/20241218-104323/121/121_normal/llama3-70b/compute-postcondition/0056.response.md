Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T`. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, `res` is its previous value plus one of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' based on the cycle of 'ACGT', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is 0, no changes are made.***
