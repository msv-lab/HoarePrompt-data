Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', if `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is updated by adding the current value of `nc` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of `count[nc]` value, `nc` iterates over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'***
