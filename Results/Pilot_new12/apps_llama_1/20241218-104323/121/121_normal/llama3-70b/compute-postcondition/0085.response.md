The code `res += c` appends the character `c` to the string `res`. 

The initial state of the variables is as follows: 
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive)
- `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character
- `avg` is `n // 4`
- `c` is the next character in `s`, and `c` is not equal to '?'
- `res` is a string (initially empty or some string, but for the sake of this problem, we consider it's being updated)

After the code execution, the new state of the variables will be:
- `n` remains an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive)
- `s` remains a non-empty string with at least one more character
- `avg` remains `n // 4`
- `c` remains the next character in `s`, and `c` is not equal to '?'
- `res` becomes `res + c` (i.e., the string `res` with the character `c` appended to the end)

The states of the variables `n`, `s`, `avg`, and `c` are not affected by the code. Only the state of `res` is changed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s` and `c` is not equal to '?', `res` is `res + c`**
