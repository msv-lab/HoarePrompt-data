Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`. If the next character `c` in `s` is '?', then `res` is updated with the first character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' found with a count greater than 0, with the corresponding count decremented by 1; if no such character is found, `res` remains unchanged. If `c` is not equal to '?', then `res` is appended with the character `c`.**
