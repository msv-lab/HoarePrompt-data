Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count['A']` is decreased by 1, `res` is updated by appending 'A' to its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['A']` is 0 or less, then no changes occur to `n`, `s`, `avg`, `c`, or `res`.***
