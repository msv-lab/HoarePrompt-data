The value of `res` is incremented by `nc`, which is 'C'. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is still a non-empty string, `avg` is still `n // 4`, `c` is still the next character in `s`, and `nc` is still 'C'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'C', `res` is the initial value of `res` plus 'C'**
