The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is 'A', `count[nc]` is `count[nc] - 1` which is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
