Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `count['G']` is `n // 4 - original_count['G'] - 1`, `res` is either 'AG' or 'ACG', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions for `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` remain as initially specified. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count['A']` is `n // 4 - original_count['A'] - 1` and `count['A']` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C'] - 1` if `res` is 'AC', otherwise `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C']`. For 'T', `count['T']` is `n // 4 - original_count['T']`.**
