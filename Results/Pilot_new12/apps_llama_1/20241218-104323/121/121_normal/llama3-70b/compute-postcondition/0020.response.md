The given code updates the value of `count[c]` in the dictionary `count`. Since `c` is 'G', `count['G']` is updated to `avg - count['G']`. We know that `avg` is `n // 4` and initially `count['G']` is not specified, so we keep it as is. 

The states of the other variables are not affected: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`, and `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['C']` is `n // 8`, `count['A']` is `n // 8`. 

The value of `count['G']` becomes `avg - count['G']` which is `(n // 4) - count['G']`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string, `c` is 'G', `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['C']` is `n // 8`, `count['A']` is `n // 8`, `count['G']` is `(n // 4) - count['G']`**
