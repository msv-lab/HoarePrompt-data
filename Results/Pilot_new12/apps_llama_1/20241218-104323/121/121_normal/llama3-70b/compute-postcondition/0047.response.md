Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `count` and `res` are updated based on the rules for the new `c`, and `nc` will iterate over 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The current value of `count[nc]` is greater than 0**
