The code `res += nc` appends the character `nc` to the string `res`. Given that `nc` is 'A', this operation is equivalent to appending 'A' to `res`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` remains an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` remains a non-empty string, `avg` remains `n // 4`, `c` remains the next character in `s`, `count` retains its values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and `nc` remains 'A'. 

However, `res` is updated by appending 'A' to its previous value. Thus, `res` becomes its previous value plus 'A'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is its previous value plus 'A', `nc` is 'A'**
