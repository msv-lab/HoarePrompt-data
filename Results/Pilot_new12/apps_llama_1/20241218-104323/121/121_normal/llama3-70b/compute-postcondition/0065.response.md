Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` is '?', then `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with at least one decremented if its initial value was greater than 0, and `res` is updated by appending the first character in 'ACGT' for which `count[nc]` was greater than 0, or remains unchanged if no such character existed. If `c` is not '?', then `count` is unchanged and `res` is updated to `res + c`.***
