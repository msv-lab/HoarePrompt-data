Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where if `c` is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' and not equal to '?', then the value of `count[c]` is the previous value of `count[c]` plus 1, otherwise the dictionary remains unchanged with updated values from the previous iteration**
