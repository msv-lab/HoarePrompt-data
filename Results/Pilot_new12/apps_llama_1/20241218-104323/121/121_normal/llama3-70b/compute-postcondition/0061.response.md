Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, if `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count` has values for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with `count['A']` decremented by 1, `res` is its previous value plus 'A', `nc` is 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
