To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for c in s:`, which means the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. 

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive),
- `s` is a non-empty string,
- `avg` is `n // 4`,
- The conditions and values of `c`, `count`, and `res` based on whether `c` is '?' or not.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must have at least one more character to iterate over. This implies that the current character `c` is not the last character in `s`. 

At the start of the next iteration:
- `n` remains the same, as there's no operation that changes `n` based on the loop iteration.
- `s` remains the same string, but the loop will now consider the next character in `s` as `c`.
- `avg` also remains the same, as it is calculated based on `n` and does not change with each iteration.
- If `c` is '?', then for the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least one more character, and the state of `count` and `res` would depend on the next character in `s` and the updated counts based on the previous iteration's `res`.
- If `c` is not '?', then `c` will be the next character in `s`, and `count` and `res` will be updated based on this new `c`.

Therefore, the adjustment at the start of the next iteration primarily involves `s` having at least one more character to process and `c` being the next character in `s`, with `count` and `res` adjusted accordingly based on the rules provided for `c` being '?' or not.

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `count` and `res` are updated based on the rules for the new `c`.**
