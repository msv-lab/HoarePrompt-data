Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` is '?', then `count` is a dictionary with updated counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on their initial values and the addition to `res`, and `res` is either an empty string if no counts were greater than 0 or contains the first available nucleotide from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the `count` dictionary. If `c` is not '?', then `c` is the first character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - original_count[c]`, and `res` is equal to `c`.***
