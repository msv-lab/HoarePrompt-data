The function takes no explicit parameters but is expected to read the input from the standard input, where the first line contains a positive integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) representing the length of the genome, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' that needs to be decoded and replaced with the four types of nucleotides in a way that their counts are equal.
