Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the solution to the problem. It first checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' and returns. It then counts the frequency of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string and checks if any of these counts exceed the target count (n / 4). If any count exceeds the target count, it prints '===' and returns.

The code then iterates through the string and replaces '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly n / 4 times.

The output hints agree with the code, and it handles the cases where the input may not be decodable (e.g., when there are not enough '?' characters to replace).

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For instance, the code correctly decodes the genome in the first example by replacing the '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly twice. It also correctly prints '===' for the third and fourth examples, where the genome cannot be decoded.

Overall, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all possible cases as described in the problem description.
