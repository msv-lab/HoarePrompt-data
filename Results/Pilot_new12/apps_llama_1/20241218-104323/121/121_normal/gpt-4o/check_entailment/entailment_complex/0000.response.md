Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and always follows the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If it is not, the program prints '===' and returns. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the number of nucleotides of each type should be equal, implying that `n` must be divisible by 4.

2. The program then counts the frequency of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s`. If any of these counts exceed `n / 4`, the program prints '===' and returns. This is also in line with the problem description, which requires that each nucleotide type should appear exactly `n / 4` times.

3. If the counts are within the limit, the program replaces '?' characters in the string with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly `n / 4` times. This is in line with the problem description, which requires that unrecognized nucleotides (represented by '?') should be replaced with one of the four types to make the counts equal.

4. Finally, the program prints the modified string. This is in line with the problem description, which requires that the decoded genome should be printed if it is possible to decode it.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and does not have any obvious logical errors. 

However, it's worth noting that the program assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors. For example, it assumes that the input will always be a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and that `n` will be an integer between 4 and 255. If these assumptions are not met, the program may not work as expected. But according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid, so this is not a concern. 

In conclusion, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
