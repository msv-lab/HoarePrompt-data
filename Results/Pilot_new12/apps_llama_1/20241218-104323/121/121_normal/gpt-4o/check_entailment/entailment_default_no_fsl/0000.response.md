Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It first checks if the length of the string is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the counts of each nucleotide to be equal. If not, it immediately prints '==='.

Then, it counts the frequencies of each nucleotide in the string and checks if any of these counts exceed the target count (n / 4). If any do, it again prints '==='.

If the counts are within the limit, it replaces the '?' characters in the string with the nucleotides that have counts less than the target count. This is done by iterating through the string and for each '?', it checks which nucleotides have counts less than the target count and replaces the '?' with the first such nucleotide it finds.

The code handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly:

- In the first example, it replaces the '?' characters with 'A', 'G', and 'T' to make the counts of each nucleotide equal to 2.
- In the second example, the string is already decoded correctly, so it simply prints the original string.
- In the third example, it is impossible to decode the genome because there are not enough '?' characters to make the counts of each nucleotide equal, so it prints '==='.
- In the fourth example, it is also impossible to decode the genome because the counts of 'A' already exceed the target count, so it prints '==='.

The code assumes that the input will always be a valid string of length n, where n is a positive integer divisible by 4, and that the string only contains the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. This is a reasonable assumption given the problem description, which states that the input will be in this format. Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
