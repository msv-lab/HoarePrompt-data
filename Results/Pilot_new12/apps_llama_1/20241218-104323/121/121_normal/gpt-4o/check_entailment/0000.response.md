Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly restores unrecognized nucleotides in a genome string, ensuring that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') becomes equal. Here's why:

1. **Length check**: The program first checks if the genome length `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints "===" as it's impossible to have equal counts of each nucleotide type.

2. **Counting existing nucleotides**: It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type in the string `s` and checks if any of them already exceed the target count (`n // 4`). If so, it prints "===" since it's impossible to balance the counts.

3. **Replacing unrecognized nucleotides**: The program iterates through the string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count. This approach ensures that the counts of each nucleotide type are balanced as much as possible.

4. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input string already has a balanced count of each nucleotide type, or when it's impossible to balance the counts due to the existing nucleotide distribution.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, including edge cases, it is considered correct. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
