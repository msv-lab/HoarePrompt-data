Correctness: **True**

The program seems to correctly implement the task of decoding the genome by replacing each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the length of the genome is a multiple of 4. If not, it immediately prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome.

3. It then checks if the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count (which is the length of the genome divided by 4). If so, it prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

4. Finally, it iterates over the genome and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:

- When the length of the genome is not a multiple of 4.
- When the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count.
- When there are multiple ways to decode the genome (in which case it prints any one of the possible decoded genomes).

The program also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly, including the cases where it's impossible to decode the genome.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all possible cases according to the problem description.
