You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly restores unrecognized nucleotides in a genome string, ensuring that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') becomes equal. Here's why:

1. **Length check**: The program first checks if the genome length `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints "===" as it's impossible to have equal counts of each nucleotide type.

2. **Counting existing nucleotides**: It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type in the string `s` and checks if any of them already exceed the target count (`n // 4`). If so, it prints "===" since it's impossible to balance the counts.

3. **Replacing unrecognized nucleotides**: The program iterates through the string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count. This approach ensures that the counts of each nucleotide type are balanced as much as possible.

4. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input string already has a balanced count of each nucleotide type, or when it's impossible to balance the counts due to the existing nucleotide distribution.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, including edge cases, it is considered correct. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string s of length n, where s consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and n is divisible by 4.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, and `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, i.e., `n % 4 == 0`.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'` where the values represent the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable and has at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'` where the values represent the frequency of each character in the string `s`, and either all values in `counts` are less than or equal to `target_count` if the loop completes, or the function has printed `'==='` and returned if any value in `counts` exceeds `target_count`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'` where each value represents the final count of characters after the loop executions and is less than or equal to `target_count`, and `result` is a list of characters updated based on the loop conditions.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, expecting an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', with `n` being divisible by 4. It counts the frequency of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s` and checks if any of these counts exceed `n / 4`. If `n` is not divisible by 4 or if any character count exceeds `n / 4`, it prints '===' and does not return an explicit value. If the counts are within the limit, it replaces '?' characters in the string with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly `n / 4` times, and then prints the modified string. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format or where the '?' characters cannot be replaced to meet the `n / 4` requirement for all characters due to insufficient '?' characters in the string. In all cases, the function does not return an explicit value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
