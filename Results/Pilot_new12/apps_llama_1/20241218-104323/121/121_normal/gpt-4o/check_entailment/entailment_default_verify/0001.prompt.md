You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program seems to correctly implement the task of decoding the genome by replacing each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the length of the genome is a multiple of 4. If not, it immediately prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome.

3. It then checks if the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count (which is the length of the genome divided by 4). If so, it prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

4. Finally, it iterates over the genome and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:

- When the length of the genome is not a multiple of 4.
- When the count of any nucleotide type exceeds the target count.
- When there are multiple ways to decode the genome (in which case it prints any one of the possible decoded genomes).

The program also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly, including the cases where it's impossible to decode the genome.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input from the standard input, expecting an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', with `n` being divisible by 4. It counts the frequency of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s` and checks if any of these counts exceed `n / 4`. If `n` is not divisible by 4 or if any character count exceeds `n / 4`, it prints '===' and does not return an explicit value. If the counts are within the limit, it replaces '?' characters in the string with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly `n / 4` times, and then prints the modified string. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format or where the '?' characters cannot be replaced to meet the `n / 4` requirement for all characters due to insufficient '?' characters in the string. In all cases, the function does not return an explicit value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
