Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where if the `char` is one of the keys in `counts`, then the value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, otherwise the state of `counts` and other variables remain unchanged***
