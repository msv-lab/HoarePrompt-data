Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` has at least one more key after `char`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result[2]` is equal to `char`, and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
