To determine the output state after the given Python code snippet, we need to understand what the code does and how it affects the variables in the initial state.

The code snippet provided is `result[i] = char`. This line assigns the value of `char` to the `i`-th index of the list `result`. 

However, in the initial state, the following variables are defined:
- `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4.
- `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements.
- `target_count` is `n // 4`.
- `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'`.

The initial state does not mention `result`, `i`, or `char`. Without information about `result`, `i`, or `char`, and without any changes to the defined variables `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, or `counts`, we can conclude that the state of `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, and `counts` remains unchanged.

However, since `result` is not defined in the initial state, if we assume that `result` is a list and `i` and `char` are defined somewhere else in the code not provided here, then after executing this line, `result[i]` will be equal to `char`. But since `result`, `i`, and `char` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot include them in the output state description based on the provided information.

Given the information and adhering strictly to the format and the provided details:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'`**
