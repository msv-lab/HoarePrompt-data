`target_count` is assigned the value of `n // 4`. Since `n` is an integer divisible by 4 with no remainder, `n // 4` will be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, i.e., `n % 4 == 0`, and `target_count` is `n // 4`.**
