Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'`, `result` is a list of characters, `i` is 0, `result[i]` is '?', and `char` is one of the keys in `counts`. The current value of `counts[char]` is less than the current value of `target_count`.**
