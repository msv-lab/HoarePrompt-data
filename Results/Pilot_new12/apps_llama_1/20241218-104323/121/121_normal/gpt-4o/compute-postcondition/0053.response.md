Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T` where if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, `counts[char]` has been incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
