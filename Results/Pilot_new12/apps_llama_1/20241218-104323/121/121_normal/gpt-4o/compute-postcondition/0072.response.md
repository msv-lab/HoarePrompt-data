Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 1, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T`' where each value represents the count of characters. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is updated to `counts[result[2]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `result[2]` is equal to `char`, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no updates are made.***
