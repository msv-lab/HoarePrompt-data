Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` has at least one more key after the current `char`, `char` is the next key in `counts`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[2]` is equal to `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then no changes are made.***
