Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result[2]` is `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, `i`, `counts`, and `result` remain unchanged***
