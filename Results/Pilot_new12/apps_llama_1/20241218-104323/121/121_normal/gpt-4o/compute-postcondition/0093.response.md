Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2. If `result[i]` is `'?'`, then `counts` has its counts updated for characters that were updated in the `result` list, and `result` has its element at index `i` updated with the first character in `counts` that had a count less than `target_count`, or remains unchanged if no such character existed. If `result[i-1]` was `'?'`, then `counts` has one of its character counts incremented by 1, specifically for the first character whose count was less than `target_count`, and `result` has one element updated to this character at index `i-1`. Otherwise, `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, `i`, `counts`, and `result` remain unchanged.***
