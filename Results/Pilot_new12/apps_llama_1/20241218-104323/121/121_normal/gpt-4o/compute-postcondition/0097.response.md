Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, expecting an integer `n` (where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', with `n` being divisible by 4. It counts the frequency of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s` and checks if any of these counts exceed `n / 4`. If `n` is not divisible by 4 or if any character count exceeds `n / 4`, it prints '===' and does not return an explicit value. If the counts are within the limit, it replaces '?' characters in the string with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to ensure each of these characters appears exactly `n / 4` times, and then prints the modified string. The function does not handle cases where the input may not match the expected format or where the '?' characters cannot be replaced to meet the `n / 4` requirement for all characters due to insufficient '?' characters in the string. In all cases, the function does not return an explicit value.**
