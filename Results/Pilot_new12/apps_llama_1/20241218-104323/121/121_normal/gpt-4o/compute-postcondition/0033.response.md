Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 with no remainder, `s` is a string, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T`' representing the frequency of each character in `s`, and `char` is the next key in the sequence of `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the console has `'==='` printed to it and the variables maintain their initial values. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables or the console.**
