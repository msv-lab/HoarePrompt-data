Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` must have at least one character, if `result[i-1]` was `'?'`, then `counts` has one of its character counts incremented by 1, specifically for the first character whose count was less than `target_count`, and `result` has one element updated to this character at index `i-1`, otherwise `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, `counts`, and `result` remain unchanged. The current value of `counts` for a character, denoted as `char`, is less than the `target_count`.**
