The code snippet provided is a simple print statement, which does not modify any variables. The print statement outputs the string '===' to the console.

The initial state of the variables is:
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`
- `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable
- `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 0

Since the code snippet does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that '===' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 0, and '===' has been printed to the console.**
