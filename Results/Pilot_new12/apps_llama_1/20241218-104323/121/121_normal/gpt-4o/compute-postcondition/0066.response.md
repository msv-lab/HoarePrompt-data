The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 1, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T`' where each value represents the count of characters and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `result[2]` is equal to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
