The input is being read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This will read the entire input from the standard input and store it in the `input` variable. The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. 

The value of `n` is still between 4 and 255 (inclusive) and `n` is divisible by 4. The string `s` still consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and its length is still `n`.

Output State: **The input is stored in the `input` variable, `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive) and divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**
