Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]` that must have at least 1 character, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if the first character `char` in `s` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values where `counts[char]` is 1 and the rest are 0, otherwise `counts` remains unchanged with all values being 0***
