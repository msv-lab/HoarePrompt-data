Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the content of the `input` variable and has at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T`' where the values represent the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `char` is the next key in the `counts` dictionary. If the frequency of `char` in `s` is greater than `target_count`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
