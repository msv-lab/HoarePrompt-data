Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 1, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 1, if `result[i]` is `'?'`, then `counts` has one of its character counts incremented by 1, specifically for the first character whose count was less than `target_count`, and `result` has one element updated to this character at index `i`, otherwise `n`, `s`, `data`, `target_count`, `counts`, and `result` remain unchanged.**
