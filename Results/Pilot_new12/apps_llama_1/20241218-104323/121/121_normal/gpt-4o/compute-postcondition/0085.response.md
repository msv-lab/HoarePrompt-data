The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial state was: `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` has at least one more key after `char` and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, and `result[2]` is equal to `char`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` has at least one more key after `char` and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result[2]` is equal to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` has at least one more key after `char` and `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result[2]` is equal to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
