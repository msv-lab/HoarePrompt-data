Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T`', `result` is a list of characters, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[result[0]]` is `counts[result[0]] + 1`, `result[0]` is `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes are made***
