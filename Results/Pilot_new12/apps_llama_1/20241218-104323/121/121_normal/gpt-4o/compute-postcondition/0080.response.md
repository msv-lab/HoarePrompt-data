The `break` statement exits the loop it is currently inside. Since there is no loop provided, it is assumed that this `break` statement is inside a loop that is not shown in the code snippet. The values of the variables are not changed by the `break` statement, but the execution of the program is affected as it breaks out of the most internal loop it was directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of 4 and greater than 2, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `i` is 2, `counts` must have at least one character and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result[2]` is `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
