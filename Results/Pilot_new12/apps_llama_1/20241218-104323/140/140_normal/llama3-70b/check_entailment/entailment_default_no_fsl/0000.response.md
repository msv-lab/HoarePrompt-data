Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the goal is to determine if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The provided code only checks if the graph contains a cycle and prints "NO" if a cycle is detected. However, it does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to make the graph acyclic.

The code does not attempt to remove any edge and check if the resulting graph is acyclic. It simply performs a DFS traversal and returns "NO" as soon as it detects a cycle. This approach is insufficient to solve the problem because it does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should attempt to remove each edge in the graph that is part of a cycle and check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, the code should print "YES"; otherwise, it should print "NO".

For example, consider the graph with edges (1,2), (2,3), (3,2), and (3,1). The provided code will detect a cycle and print "NO". However, if we remove the edge (3,1), the resulting graph is acyclic. Therefore, the correct output for this example should be "YES", but the provided code will print "NO".
