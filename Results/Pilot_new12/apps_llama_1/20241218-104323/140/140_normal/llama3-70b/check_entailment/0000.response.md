Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not attempt to remove any edge and check if the resulting graph is acyclic. It simply checks if the original graph has a cycle and prints "NO" if it does. However, according to the problem description, it is allowed to remove at most one edge to make the graph acyclic.

The program should check all possible edges, remove each one temporarily, and then check if the resulting graph has any cycles. If it finds an edge that, when removed, makes the graph acyclic, it should print "YES". If it checks all edges and none of them make the graph acyclic when removed, it should print "NO". 

For example, the given program will incorrectly print "NO" for the following input:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
Because it will find a cycle in the original graph and immediately print "NO", without checking if removing one of the edges would make the graph acyclic. However, if we remove the edge from 3 to 1, the graph becomes acyclic, so the correct output should be "YES". 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
    edges.append((u, v))

def has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, node):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, neighbor):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

def is_acyclic(graph):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[node]:
            if has_cycle(graph, visited, rec_stack, node):
                return False
    return True

for (u, v) in edges:
    graph[u] = [x for x in graph[u] if x!= v]
    if is_acyclic(graph):
        print('YES')
        break
    graph[u] = [x for x in graph[u] if x!= v]
    graph[u].append(v)

else:
    print('NO')
```
This code checks each edge, removes it, and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge that makes the graph acyclic when removed, it prints "YES" and stops. If it checks all edges and none of them make the graph acyclic when removed, it prints "NO".
