Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code checks if a directed graph is acyclic by performing a depth-first search traversal. However, it only detects the presence of a cycle and does not check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. The code does not handle the case where removing an edge can break a cycle, which is the main requirement of the problem description. 

To make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, the code should not only detect the presence of a cycle but also check all edges to see if removing any one of them would make the graph acyclic. The given code only outputs 'NO' as soon as it detects a cycle, without considering the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

A correct solution would involve checking all edges to see if removing any one of them would make the graph acyclic, which the given code does not do. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is False. 

For example, given the input:

4 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
1 3

The given code will output 'NO' because it detects a cycle. However, removing the edge 4 -> 1 would make the graph acyclic, so the correct output should be 'YES'.
