Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It detects if the graph contains a cycle but does not check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. 

The given code simply performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect a cycle in the graph. If it finds a cycle, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". However, this approach does not consider the case where removing one edge can make the graph acyclic.

For example, consider the graph with edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 1). The given program will print "NO" because it detects a cycle (2 -> 3 -> 2). However, removing the edge (3, 2) will make the graph acyclic, so the correct answer is "YES". 

The program should check all possible edge removals and verify if the resulting graph is acyclic. If at least one such removal makes the graph acyclic, it should print "YES". Otherwise, it should print "NO". 

Here's a correct approach in Python:

```python
def is_acyclic(graph):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    rec_stack = [False] * len(graph)
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        rec_stack[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
                return True
        rec_stack[node] = False
        return False

    for node in range(len(graph)):
        if not visited[node]:
            if dfs(node):
                return False
    return True

def make_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    if is_acyclic(graph):
        return True

    for i in range(m):
        u, v = edges[i]
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if is_acyclic(graph):
            return True
        graph[u].append(v)

    return False

n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((u, v))

if make_acyclic(n, m, edges):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
