Postcondition: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must not be empty, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. The current value of `visited[neighbor]` is False. Additionally, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` evaluates to True, indicating a specific condition is met for the `neighbor` in the graph with the given `visited` and `rec_stack` states.**
