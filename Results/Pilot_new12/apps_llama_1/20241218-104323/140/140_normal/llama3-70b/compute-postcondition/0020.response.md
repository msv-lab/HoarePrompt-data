Postcondition: ***`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True, if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, then the program returns True, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged***
