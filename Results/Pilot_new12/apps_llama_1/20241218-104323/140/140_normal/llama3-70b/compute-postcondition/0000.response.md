The value of `visited[node]` is set to `True`, indicating that the node has been visited. The states of the other variables are not affected. The graph remains the same, and the rec_stack is unchanged. The visited list/set is updated to reflect that node has been visited.

Output State: **node is a non-negative integer, graph is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, visited is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, rec_stack is a list or set of non-negative integers used to track vertices in the recursion stack**
