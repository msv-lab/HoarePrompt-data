According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and the `node`. If `graph[node]` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least one more element, and other variables' values are as given. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `graph[node]` must have at least one more element after removing the last neighbor, and the new `neighbor` will be the next element in `graph[node]`.
State: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must have at least one element, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `neighbor` is the next element in `graph[node]`**
