According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph` and the `node`. If `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must not be empty, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor. This implies that `node` remains unchanged because the loop iterates over the neighbors of the current `node`, and `graph` remains unchanged. The `visited` and `rec_stack` states for the current `node` also remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` does not change the state of `visited`, `rec_stack`, `node`, and `graph` when `visited[neighbor]` is True. The loop can only execute again if there is another `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.
State: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must have at least one more element, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged**
