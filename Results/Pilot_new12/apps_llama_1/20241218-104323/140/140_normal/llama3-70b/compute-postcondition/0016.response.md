Postcondition: ***`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must have at least one more element, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the program returns True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
