Postcondition: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must not be empty, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, and the current value of `visited[neighbor]` is True. Additionally, the current value of `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, indicating that the neighbor of the current node is in the recursion stack.**
