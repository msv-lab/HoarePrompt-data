The value of `rec_stack[node]` is updated to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The `node` is still a non-negative integer, `graph` is still a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph, `visited` still reflects the nodes visited during the traversal attempt from `node`, and `rec_stack` still indicates nodes in the recursion stack, but `rec_stack[node]` is now `False`.
Output State: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph, `visited` reflects the nodes visited during the traversal attempt from `node`, and `rec_stack` indicates nodes in the recursion stack with `rec_stack[node]` equals `False`**
