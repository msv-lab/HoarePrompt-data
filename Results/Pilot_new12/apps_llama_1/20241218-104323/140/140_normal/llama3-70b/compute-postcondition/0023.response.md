Postcondition: ***`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` must have at least one element, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, then if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the program returns True, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `visited[neighbor]` is True, then if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the program returns True, indicating a result from a function likely related to graph traversal, otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
