Postcondition: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is True, the program returns True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.**
