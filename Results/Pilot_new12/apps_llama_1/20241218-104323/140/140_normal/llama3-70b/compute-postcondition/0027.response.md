The function `func_1` accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. `node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, and `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists or sets of non-negative integers used to track visited vertices and vertices in the recursion stack. 

After executing the function body, there are multiple possible return values based on different conditions: 
- Case_1 to Case_5 and Case_6: the function returns True under various conditions related to graph traversal and cycle detection.
- Case_7: the function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `node`, a directed graph `graph`, and tracking lists `visited` and `rec_stack`, and return a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of a cycle in the graph or a specific result from graph traversal.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, and returns a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of a cycle or a result from graph traversal.**
