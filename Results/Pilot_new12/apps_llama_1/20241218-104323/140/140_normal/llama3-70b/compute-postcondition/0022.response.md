Postcondition: **`node` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a directed graph with n vertices and m edges where `graph[node]` has at least one element, `visited` is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, `rec_stack` is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the program returns True, indicating a result from a function likely related to graph traversal. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, no additional changes are made.**
