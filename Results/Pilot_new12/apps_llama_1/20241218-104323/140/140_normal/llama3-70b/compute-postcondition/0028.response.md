Functionality: **The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a directed graph, starting from a given node, to detect the presence of a cycle. It accepts four parameters: a non-negative integer node, a directed graph represented as a list of lists or dictionary, and two lists or sets (visited and rec_stack) used to track visited vertices and vertices in the recursion stack, respectively. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a cycle is detected (True) or not (False). Upon completion, the function will have updated the visited and rec_stack data structures to reflect the nodes visited and the recursion stack state during the traversal attempt from the given node. The function handles cases where a node has unvisited neighbors, visited neighbors that are in the recursion stack (indicating a cycle), and nodes that have been fully traversed without finding a cycle. It will return True as soon as a cycle is detected and False otherwise, covering all potential edge cases such as empty graphs, single-node graphs, and graphs with multiple connected components.**
