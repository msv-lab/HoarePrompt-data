The value of `rec_stack[node]` is set to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The node is still a non-negative integer, the graph is still a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, and `visited[node]` is still True.

Output State: **node is a non-negative integer, graph is a list of lists or dictionary representing a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, visited is a list or set where `visited[node]` is True and other values are unchanged, rec_stack is a list or set of non-negative integers where `rec_stack[node]` is True and other values are unchanged**
