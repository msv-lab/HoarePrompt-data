Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and may also contain a `neighbor` that has been added if its in-degree became 0 after `node` removal, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1 for each `neighbor` of `node`.***
