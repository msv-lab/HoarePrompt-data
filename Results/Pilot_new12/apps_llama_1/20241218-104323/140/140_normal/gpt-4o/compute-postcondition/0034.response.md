The given Python code appends `neighbor` to `queue`. Given the initial state, for at least one `neighbor` of `node`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, so `neighbor` is appended to `queue`. 

Since `queue` is a deque and had `node` removed from its left, and now `neighbor` is appended to it, the updated `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and the newly added `neighbor`. The states of `graph`, `node`, `count`, and `in_degree` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and the newly added `neighbor`, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1 for each `neighbor` of `node`**
