The code decrements the `in_degree` of the `neighbor` node by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The `queue` still has its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0, `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor.

Output State: **`queue` has its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0, `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree` of all nodes are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is one less than its previous value**
