The value of `node` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in `queue`, and then this element is removed from `queue`. The state of `queue` changes because an element has been removed from it. Since `queue` must not be empty initially, after removing one element, `queue` can be empty or not empty depending on whether it had one or more elements. The value of `node` is now equal to the former leftmost element of `queue`.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue`**
