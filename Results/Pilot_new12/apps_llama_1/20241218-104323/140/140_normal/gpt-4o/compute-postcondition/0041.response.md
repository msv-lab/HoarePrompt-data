The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. This means that for each `neighbor` of `node`, its in-degree is reduced by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The `graph` remains the same, `node` is still removed from `queue`, `count` is still incremented, and `queue` still contains the remaining elements and possibly the new neighbors with in-degree 0. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and possibly the new neighbors with in-degree 0, and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is either 0 for the newly added `neighbor` or `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` for each `neighbor` of `node`, and specifically `in_degree[neighbor]` is now `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`.**
