To solve this task, we consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and all values initialized to 0.
- `u` is the first key in `graph`.
- `graph[u]` must be non-empty.

The code snippet is:
```python
in_degree[v] += 1
```

However, to correctly interpret this line, we must understand that `v` is not directly defined in the given initial state. But considering the context of a graph and the update of `in_degree`, it's logical to infer that `v` would be a node in the graph that is adjacent to `u`, given the common operations in graph theory involving degree updates.

Assuming `v` is an element of `graph[u]` (since `graph[u]` is non-empty and `u` is the first key in `graph`), the line `in_degree[v] += 1` increases the in-degree count of node `v` by 1.

Thus, after the execution of the given code snippet, the changes are as follows:
- The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, where `v` is a node in the graph adjacent to `u`.
- The states of `graph`, `n`, and `u` are not affected by this operation.
- Since the specific value of `v` isn't provided, we acknowledge that the in-degree of at least one node in the graph (a node that `u` points to) has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where at least one value (corresponding to a node adjacent to `u`) has been incremented by 1, `u` is the first key in `graph`, and `graph[u]` is non-empty.**
