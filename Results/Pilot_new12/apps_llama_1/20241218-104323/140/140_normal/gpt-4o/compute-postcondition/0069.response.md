Postcondition: ***`queue` has one less element initially, `node` is the new leftmost node from `queue` and exists in `graph`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, for all nodes, `in_degree` is decreased by the number of times they were referenced as neighbors during the loop. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` has `neighbor` as its new element, `node` remains the new leftmost node from the previous `queue` and exists in `graph`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph` with an in-degree of 0. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is not 0, then the state of the program remains the same as the initial state.***
