The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `in_degree[v]` now holds the value of the original in-degree of node `v` plus the number of times it appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus one. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph with at least three keys, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where the value of each key is the original in-degree of the node plus the number of times it appears as an adjacent node of `u`, except for `v` which is one more, `u` is the third key in `graph` and `graph[u]` must not be empty, `v` is the first adjacent node of `u`.

Output State: **`graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph with at least three keys, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where the value of each key is the original in-degree of the node plus the number of times it appears as an adjacent node of `u`, except for `v` where `in_degree[v]` is the original in-degree of `v` plus the number of times `v` appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus one, `u` is the third key in `graph` and `graph[u]` must not be empty, `v` is the first adjacent node of `u`.**
