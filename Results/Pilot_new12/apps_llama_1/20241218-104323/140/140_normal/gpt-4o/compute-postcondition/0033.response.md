Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `queue` is a deque that has just had `node` removed from its left, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1 for each `neighbor` of `node`, and `node` has at least one neighbor in `graph`. For at least one `neighbor` of `node`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
