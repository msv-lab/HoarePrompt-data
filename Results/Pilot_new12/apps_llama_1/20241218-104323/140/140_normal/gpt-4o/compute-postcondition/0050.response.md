Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, after the decrease from a previous value where it was at least 1 to allow for the decrease, indicating that the neighbor has no more incoming edges.**
