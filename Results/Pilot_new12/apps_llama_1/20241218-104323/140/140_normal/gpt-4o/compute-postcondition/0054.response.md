The code statement `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the in-degree of each `neighbor` of `node` by 1. 

The value of `queue` remains the same as it had one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty. 
The value of `node` remains the same as it is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`.
The value of `count` remains the same as it is increased by 1.
The value of `graph[node]` remains the same as it must have at least two neighbors.

However, `in_degree[neighbor]` is updated as its value is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least two neighbors, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 for each neighbor of `node`.
Output State: **`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least two neighbors, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals its former value minus 1 for each neighbor of `node`.**
