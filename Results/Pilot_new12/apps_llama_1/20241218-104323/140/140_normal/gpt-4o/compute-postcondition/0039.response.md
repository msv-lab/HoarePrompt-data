Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `count` is incremented after `node` removal. If `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0 after `node` removal, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and also contains `neighbor`, and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 for the newly added `neighbor` and `in_degree` of other nodes remains the same. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is not 0 after `node` removal, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` for each `neighbor` of `node`.***
