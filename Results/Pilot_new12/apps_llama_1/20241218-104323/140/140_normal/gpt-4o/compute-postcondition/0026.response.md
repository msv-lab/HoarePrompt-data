The code creates a queue and initializes it with nodes from the `in_degree` dictionary that have an in-degree of 0. This means that the queue will contain all nodes in the graph that have no incoming edges.

The `graph` dictionary and the `n` integer are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same.

The `in_degree` dictionary is also not modified by the code, so its values remain the same.

A new variable `queue` is created, which is a deque containing all nodes with an in-degree of 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key `v` has a value equal to the number of edges in `graph` that point to `v`, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0**
