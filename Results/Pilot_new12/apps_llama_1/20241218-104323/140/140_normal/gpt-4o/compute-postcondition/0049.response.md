The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the in-degree of `neighbor` by 1. 

The initial state is: `queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor.

After running the Python code, the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1**.
