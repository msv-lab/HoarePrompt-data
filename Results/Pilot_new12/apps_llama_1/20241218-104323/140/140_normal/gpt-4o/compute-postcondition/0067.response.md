Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element, `node` is the new leftmost node from `queue` and exists in `graph`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, for all nodes, `in_degree` is decreased by the number of times they were referenced as neighbors during the loop and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph` and has an in-degree of 0**
