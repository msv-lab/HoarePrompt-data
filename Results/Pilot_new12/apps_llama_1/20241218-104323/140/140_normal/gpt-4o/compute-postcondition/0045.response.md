According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `queue` is not explicitly mentioned, but since the loop has executed at least once, we can infer that `queue` was not empty initially. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must not be empty. Since we do not have any information about the current state of `queue`, we need to adjust its state to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`queue` must not be empty**
