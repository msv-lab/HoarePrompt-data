The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has one less element, `node` is the new leftmost node from `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, and for all nodes, `in_degree` is decreased by the number of times they were referenced as neighbors during the loop.
