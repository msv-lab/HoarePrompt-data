To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The loop iterates over each key `u` in the `graph` dictionary. For this loop to execute, `graph` must have at least one key, meaning `n` must be greater than 0, and `graph` must not be empty.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph.
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and all values initialized to 0.

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `graph` to be non-empty, implying `n` must be greater than 0.
- Since `u` will take the value of each key in `graph` during each iteration, initially, `u` should be the first key in `graph`.

State: **`graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` must be greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and all values initialized to 0, `u` is the first key in `graph`**
