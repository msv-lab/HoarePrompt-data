According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors, the loop can execute again for the next neighbor. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors, and one neighbor has been processed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `graph[node]` must have at least one more unprocessed neighbor.

State: **`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one more unprocessed neighbor, for each original neighbor of `node` that has been processed, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals its former value minus 1, and if there is a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing, then this `neighbor` is added to `queue`**
