The code appends `neighbor` to `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is either 0 for the newly added `neighbor` or `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` for each `neighbor` of `node`, and `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal), the new neighbors with in-degree 0, and `neighbor`.**
