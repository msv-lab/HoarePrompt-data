The code removes and returns the leftmost node from the `queue`. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` must contain at least one node with an in-degree of 0, `queue` is a deque containing all remaining nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0, `count` equals 0, and `node` is the node that was removed from the left of the `queue`**
