Postcondition: ***`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is added to `queue` and `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0. Otherwise, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.***
