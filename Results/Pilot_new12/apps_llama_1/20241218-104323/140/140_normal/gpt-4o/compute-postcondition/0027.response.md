The provided code initializes a new variable `count` and assigns it the value 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key `v` has a value equal to the number of edges in `graph` that point to `v`, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0, and `count` equals 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key `v` has a value equal to the number of edges in `graph` that point to `v`, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0, and `count` equals 0**
