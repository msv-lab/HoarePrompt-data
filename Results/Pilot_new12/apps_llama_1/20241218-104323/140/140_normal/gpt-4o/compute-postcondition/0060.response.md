Postcondition: ***`queue` has one less element than initially or has one more element than initially if a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing was added to `queue`, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least one more unprocessed neighbor, for each original neighbor of `node` that has been processed, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals its former value minus 1, and if there is a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing, then this `neighbor` is added to `queue`.***
