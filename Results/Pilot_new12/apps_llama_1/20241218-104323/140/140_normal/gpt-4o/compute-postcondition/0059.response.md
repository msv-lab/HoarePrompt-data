The given code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. 

The `queue` had one less element than initially and could be empty or not empty. After adding a `neighbor` to it, the `queue` now has the same number of elements as initially or is not empty if it was. 

`node` is still equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`. 

`count` is still increased by 1. 

`graph[node]` still has at least one more unprocessed neighbor. 

For each original neighbor of `node` that has been processed, `in_degree[neighbor]` still equals its former value minus 1.

If there is a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing, then this `neighbor` is added to `queue`, which is what this line of code does.

Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially or is not empty if it was, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least one more unprocessed neighbor, for each original neighbor of `node` that has been processed, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals its former value minus 1, and a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing is added to `queue`.**
