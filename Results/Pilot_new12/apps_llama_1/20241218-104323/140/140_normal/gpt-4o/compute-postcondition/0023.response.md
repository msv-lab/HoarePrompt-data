The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `in_degree[v]` was the original in-degree of `v` plus the number of times `v` appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus two. So, the new value of `in_degree[v]` is the original in-degree of `v` plus the number of times `v` appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus three. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph with at least three keys, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where the value of each key is the original in-degree of the node plus the number of times it appears as an adjacent node of `u`, except for `v` where `in_degree[v]` is the original in-degree of `v` plus the number of times `v` appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus three, `u` is the third key in `graph` and `graph[u]` must have at least three adjacent nodes, `v` is the third adjacent node of `u`.

Output State: **`graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph with at least three keys, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where the value of each key is the original in-degree of the node plus the number of times it appears as an adjacent node of `u`, except for `v` where `in_degree[v]` is the original in-degree of `v` plus the number of times `v` appears as an adjacent node of `u` plus three, `u` is the third key in `graph` and `graph[u]` must have at least three adjacent nodes, `v` is the third adjacent node of `u`.**
