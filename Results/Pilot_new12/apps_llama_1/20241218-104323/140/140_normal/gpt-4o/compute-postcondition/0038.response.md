The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since `neighbor` was added to the `queue` because its in-degree became 0 after `node` removal, we know that `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and also contains `neighbor`, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, and `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 for the newly added `neighbor` and `in_degree` of other nodes remains the same**.
