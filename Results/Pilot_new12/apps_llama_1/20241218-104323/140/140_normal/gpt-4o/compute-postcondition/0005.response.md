The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where at least one value, including `in_degree[v]`, has been incremented by 1, `u` is the first key in `graph`, `graph[u]` is non-empty and has at least one more element to iterate over, and `v` is the next node in `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` is one more than its initial value.

Output State: **`graph` is a non-empty dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is greater than 0, `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` where at least one value, including `in_degree[v]`, has been incremented by 1, `u` is the first key in `graph`, `graph[u]` is non-empty and has at least one more element to iterate over, and `v` is the next node in `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` is `in_degree[v] + 1`**
