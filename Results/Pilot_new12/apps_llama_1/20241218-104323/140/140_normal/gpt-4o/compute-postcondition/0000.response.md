To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph. Each key in the dictionary is a node (an integer from 1 to `n`), and each value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.

2. **Given Code**:
   ```python
in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
```
   This line of code creates a new dictionary named `in_degree` where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and each value is initialized to 0. This dictionary seems to be intended to store the in-degree of each node in the graph, which is the number of edges arriving at that node.

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code does not modify the `graph` or `n`. It only introduces a new dictionary, `in_degree`, with all values initialized to 0.
   - The `in_degree` dictionary is directly related to the nodes in the graph (as its keys range from 1 to `n`), but it does not affect the structure or content of the `graph` dictionary.

4. **Output State**:
   - `graph` remains a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to `n`) and each value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
   - `in_degree` is a new dictionary where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to `n`), and each value is 0, representing the initial in-degree of each node.

Therefore, considering the above analysis, the output state after executing the given code is:

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to `n`) and each value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and `in_degree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and all values initialized to 0.**
