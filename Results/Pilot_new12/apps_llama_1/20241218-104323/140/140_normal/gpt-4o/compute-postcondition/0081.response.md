The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and each value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of nodes processed is not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph. Therefore, the functionality of the function `has_cycle` is to accept a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph and return a boolean value indicating whether the graph has a cycle based on the total number of nodes processed.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary graph representing a directed graph and returns a boolean value indicating whether the graph has a cycle based on the total number of nodes processed.**
