Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `node` is a node that was in `queue` and has been removed, `count` is incremented after `node` removal, `in_degree` contains updated in-degrees where `in_degree[neighbor]` is either 0 for the newly added `neighbor` or `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` for each `neighbor` of `node`, and specifically `in_degree[neighbor]` is now `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `queue` contains the previously remaining elements (after `node` removal) and possibly the new neighbors with in-degree 0, if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `neighbor` is added to `queue`.***
