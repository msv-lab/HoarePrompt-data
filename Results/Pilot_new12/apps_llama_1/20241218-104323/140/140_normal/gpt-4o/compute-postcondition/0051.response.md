The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. 

The initial state is: 
- `queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, 
- `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, 
- `count` is increased by 1, 
- `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, 
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, 
- The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.

After running the Python code, 
- `queue` now has the `neighbor` added to it, so it has one more element than before, 
- The state of `node` does not change, 
- The state of `count` does not change, 
- The state of `graph[node]` does not change, 
- The state of `in_degree[neighbor]` does not change, it remains 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`queue` has the `neighbor` added to it, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of the initial `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.

Output State: **`queue` has the `neighbor` added to it, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of the initial `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
