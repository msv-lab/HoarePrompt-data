The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` node to the end of the `queue`. The `queue` had its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0, and `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`. The `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one. The `in_degree` of all nodes are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`. The `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor.

Given that `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in `graph`, after appending `neighbor` to `queue`, the state of `queue` is updated to include `neighbor`. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that `queue` now contains `neighbor` as its last element.

Output State: **`queue` has its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0 and now includes `neighbor` as its last element, `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree` of all nodes are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in `graph`.**
