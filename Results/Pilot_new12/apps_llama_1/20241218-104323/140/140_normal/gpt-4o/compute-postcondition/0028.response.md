According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0. For the loop to execute at least one time, `queue` must not be empty. This means that there must be at least one node in `in_degree` with an in-degree of 0. 

So, the state of `in_degree` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it contains at least one node with an in-degree of 0. The other states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` must contain at least one node with an in-degree of 0, `queue` is a non-empty deque containing all nodes `node` in `in_degree` where `in_degree[node]` equals 0, and `count` equals 0**
