Postcondition: ***`queue` has one less element than initially and can be empty or not empty, `node` is equal to the former leftmost element of `queue` and exists as a key in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` must have at least two neighbors, for each original neighbor of `node`, `in_degree[neighbor]` equals its former value minus 1, and if there is a `neighbor` of `node` where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0 after decreasing, then this `neighbor` is added to `queue`***
