Postcondition: ***`queue` has its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0, `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree` of all nodes are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `neighbor` is added as the last element in `queue`, otherwise the state of `queue` remains unchanged with `neighbor` being the next neighbor of `node` in `graph`.***
