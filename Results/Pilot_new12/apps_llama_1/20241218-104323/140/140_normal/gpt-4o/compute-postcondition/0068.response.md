The value of `queue` is updated by appending `neighbor` to it. The previous state of `queue` had one less element, and `node` was the new leftmost node from `queue`. Now, `queue` includes `neighbor` as its new element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` has `neighbor` as its new element in addition to its previous elements, `node` is the new leftmost node from the previous `queue` and exists in `graph`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, for all nodes, `in_degree` is decreased by the number of times they were referenced as neighbors during the loop and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph` and has an in-degree of 0.

Output State: **`queue` has `neighbor` as its new element, `node` is the new leftmost node from the previous `queue` and exists in `graph`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, for all nodes, `in_degree` is decreased by the number of times they were referenced as neighbors during the loop and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `graph[node]` must have at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph` and has an in-degree of 0**
