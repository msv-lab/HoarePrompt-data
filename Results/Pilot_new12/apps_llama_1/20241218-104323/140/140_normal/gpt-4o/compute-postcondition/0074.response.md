According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` has its elements updated, `node` is the same, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree` of all nodes are updated, and `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor. Since `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in `graph`, for the loop to execute again, `neighbor` must be the next element in `graph[node]`.
State: **`queue` has its elements updated based on new nodes with in-degree 0, `node` is the same as it was leftmost in `queue`, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed plus one, `in_degree` of all nodes are updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `node` in `graph`**
