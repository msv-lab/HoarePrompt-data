The function determines whether a directed graph, represented by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges, contains a cycle that can be removed by deleting a single edge. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `m` (the number of edges), and `edges` (a list of pairs of integers representing the directed edges in the graph). The function returns either `'YES'` if such an edge exists whose removal would result in a cycle-free graph or `'NO'` if no such edge exists. The function's state after execution includes the original graph structure unless the function returned `'YES'` early, indicating a modification was found that would remove the cycle. The function covers potential edge cases such as an empty graph (when `edges` is empty), graphs with multiple cycles, and graphs where removing any edge would not affect the presence of cycles.
