Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement a solution for the problem of determining whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The function `func_1` checks if the original graph has a cycle using the `has_cycle` function. If the graph does not have a cycle, it immediately returns 'YES'. If the graph has a cycle, it then iterates through each edge and temporarily removes it to check if the resulting graph has a cycle. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If it checks all edges and does not find one that can be removed to make the graph acyclic, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses a topological sorting approach with in-degree calculation and a queue to check if a graph has a cycle. It correctly handles the case where the graph is empty.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code and suggest that the functions handle various edge cases, including empty graphs and graphs with multiple cycles.

The code should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. It handles the base case where the graph does not have a cycle and also checks all possible edges to see if removing any one of them would make the graph acyclic. The provided examples also demonstrate its correctness in different scenarios.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, the code seems to be correct for all potential cases.
