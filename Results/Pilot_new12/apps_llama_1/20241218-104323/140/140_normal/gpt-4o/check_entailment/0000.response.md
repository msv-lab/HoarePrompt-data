Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It checks whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

The `func_1` function constructs the graph from the given edges and then calls the `has_cycle` function to check if the graph contains a cycle. If the graph is already acyclic, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iteratively removes each edge and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If it checks all edges and none of their removals make the graph acyclic, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses the concept of topological sorting to check if the graph contains a cycle. It calculates the in-degree of each node and uses a queue to process nodes with an in-degree of 0. If it can process all nodes (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the number of nodes), the graph is acyclic. Otherwise, it contains a cycle.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code seems to handle all possible scenarios correctly, including the examples provided. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
