Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem described. It checks if the given directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The function `func_1` iterates over each edge in the graph, temporarily removes it, and then checks if the resulting graph is acyclic using the `has_cycle` function. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses the in-degree of each node and a breadth-first traversal to determine if the graph contains a cycle. If a graph has no cycles, it should be possible to process all nodes during the traversal, resulting in a count of processed nodes equal to the total number of nodes `n`. If the count is less than `n`, it indicates that there are nodes that cannot be reached, suggesting the presence of a cycle.

The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. For instance, in the first example, removing the edge from 2 to 3 makes the graph acyclic, and the code correctly returns 'YES'. In the second example, removing any single edge does not make the graph acyclic, and the code correctly returns 'NO'.

Given that the program logic aligns with the problem description and it handles the provided examples correctly, and assuming valid input, the program appears to be correct for every potential case described in the problem.
