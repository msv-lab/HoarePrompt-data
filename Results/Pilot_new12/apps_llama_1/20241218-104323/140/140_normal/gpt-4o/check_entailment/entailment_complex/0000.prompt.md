You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertices, m is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges, and edges is a list of pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 <= u, v <= n, u!= v, representing the directed edges in the graph.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers, and `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex `u` and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring vertices `v` such that `(u, v)` is an edge in `edges`, or `graph` is an empty dictionary if `edges` is empty.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers, and `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex `u` and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring vertices `v` such that `(u, v)` is an edge in `edges`, or `graph` is an empty dictionary if `edges` is empty. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of pairs of integers, and `graph` is a dictionary representing a graph with its original structure unless the function returned `'YES'` early, indicating a modification was found that would remove the cycle, but this return does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `edges`, only the program's flow.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns string 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a directed graph, represented by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges, contains a cycle that can be removed by deleting a single edge. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `m` (the number of edges), and `edges` (a list of pairs of integers representing the directed edges in the graph). The function returns either `'YES'` if such an edge exists whose removal would result in a cycle-free graph or `'NO'` if no such edge exists. The function's state after execution includes the original graph structure unless the function returned `'YES'` early, indicating a modification was found that would remove the cycle. The function covers potential edge cases such as an empty graph (when `edges` is empty), graphs with multiple cycles, and graphs where removing any edge would not affect the presence of cycles.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and each value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and n is a non-negative integer such that it is the number of vertices in the graph.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key `v` has a value equal to the number of edges in `graph` that point to `v`.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` equals the total number of nodes processed from the initial `queue`, and `in_degree` values are updated to reflect the graph processing, with `node` being the last processed node from `queue` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `node` and `count` retain their initial values and `in_degree` remains unchanged if the loop did not execute.
    return count != n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of nodes processed (0) is not equal to the total number of nodes in the graph (n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph and an implicit integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the graph, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the graph has a cycle. The function calculates the in-degree of each node, initializes a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0, and then performs a breadth-first traversal of the graph. If all nodes are processed during the traversal (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the total number of nodes `n`), the function returns `False`, indicating that the graph does not have a cycle. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating the presence of a cycle. The function handles graphs with any number of nodes and edges, including the edge case where the graph is empty (i.e., `n` equals 0). However, the function assumes that the input graph is well-formed, i.e., it does not contain any nodes with values outside the range from 1 to `n`, and it does not account for potential errors that may occur if the graph is not well-formed or if the input `n` does not match the actual number of nodes in the graph.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
