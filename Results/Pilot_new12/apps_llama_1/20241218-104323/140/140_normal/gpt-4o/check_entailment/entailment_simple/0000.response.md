Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a solution to the problem of determining if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. The `func_1` function constructs a graph from the given edges and checks if the graph is acyclic using the `has_cycle` function. If it is acyclic, the function returns 'YES'.

2. If the graph is not acyclic, the function iterates over each edge in the graph. For each edge, it removes the edge from the graph and checks again if the graph is acyclic. If it is, the function returns 'YES'.

3. If the function has checked all edges and the graph is still not acyclic, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses a topological sorting algorithm to check if a graph is acyclic. It calculates the in-degree of each node and starts a queue with nodes that have an in-degree of 0. Then, it iteratively removes nodes from the queue and decreases the in-degree of their neighbors. If it can remove all nodes from the graph, the graph is acyclic.

The program is correct because it checks all possible ways to remove at most one edge from the graph and makes sure that the resulting graph is acyclic. It handles all potential cases and follows the problem description.

Here are some key points that demonstrate the program's correctness:

- The program constructs the graph correctly from the given edges.
- The `has_cycle` function correctly checks if a graph is acyclic using a topological sorting algorithm.
- The program checks all possible ways to remove at most one edge from the graph.
- The program returns 'YES' if it can make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge and 'NO' otherwise.

Overall, the program is a correct solution to the problem and follows the problem description.
