You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It checks whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

The `func_1` function constructs the graph from the given edges and then calls the `has_cycle` function to check if the graph contains a cycle. If the graph is already acyclic, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iteratively removes each edge and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If it checks all edges and none of their removals make the graph acyclic, it returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function uses the concept of topological sorting to check if the graph contains a cycle. It calculates the in-degree of each node and uses a queue to process nodes with an in-degree of 0. If it can process all nodes (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the number of nodes), the graph is acyclic. Otherwise, it contains a cycle.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code seems to handle all possible scenarios correctly, including the examples provided. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `has_cycle` accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph and an implicit integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the graph, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the graph has a cycle. The function calculates the in-degree of each node, initializes a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0, and then performs a breadth-first traversal of the graph. If all nodes are processed during the traversal (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the total number of nodes `n`), the function returns `False`, indicating that the graph does not have a cycle. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating the presence of a cycle. The function handles graphs with any number of nodes and edges, including the edge case where the graph is empty (i.e., `n` equals 0). However, the function assumes that the input graph is well-formed, i.e., it does not contain any nodes with values outside the range from 1 to `n`, and it does not account for potential errors that may occur if the graph is not well-formed or if the input `n` does not match the actual number of nodes in the graph.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
