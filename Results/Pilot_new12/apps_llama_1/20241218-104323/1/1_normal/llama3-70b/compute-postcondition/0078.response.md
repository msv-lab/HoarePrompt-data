Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, then -1 has been printed to the console. If `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1, then if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans`, which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, has been printed.**
