The code changes the value of `f` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is -1, `f` is `True`.
Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is -1, `f` is `True`**
