Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `ind` state remains the same. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is `True`. If `s[i]` is not ']', then `f` and `bind` states depend on the value of `s[i]`: if `s[i]` is '=', then `f` and `bind` remain unchanged; if `s[i]` is ':', then if `f` is `True`, `bind` is set to `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, `bind` remains unchanged.**
