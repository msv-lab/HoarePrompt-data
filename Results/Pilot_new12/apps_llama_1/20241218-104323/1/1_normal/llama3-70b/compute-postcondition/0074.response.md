Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind - 2`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 3`, `i` is `ind + 3`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '|', then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` (which depends on the character at index `i` in `s`) plus 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '|', then the state of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value (which depends on the character at index `i` in `s`).***
