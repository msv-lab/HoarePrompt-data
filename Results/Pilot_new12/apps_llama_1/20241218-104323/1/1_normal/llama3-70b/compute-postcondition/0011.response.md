The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is 0, `f` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` was not '[' and the character at index `i` of string `s` was ':', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
