The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. 

The value of `s` is still an input string, `n` is still the length of string `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `f` is still `False`, but now `ind` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, `f` is `False`**
