The variable `ind` is assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables, `s` and `n`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `ind` is `-1`.
Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s`, `ind` is `-1`**
