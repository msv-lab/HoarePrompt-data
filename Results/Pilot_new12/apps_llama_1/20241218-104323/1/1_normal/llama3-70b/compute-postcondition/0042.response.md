Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ']', then `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' if such a sequence exists, otherwise -1, and `bind` is -1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ':', then if `f` was initially `True`, `bind` is `n-1`, otherwise, `bind` is -1 and `f` remains `False`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is neither ']' nor ':', the state of the variables remains unchanged with `f` being `False` and `bind` being -1.***
