Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, initially `f` was `False`, the current value of `f` remains unchanged as `False` because the if condition doesn't change it, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' if such a sequence exists, otherwise -1, `bind` is -1, and the current value of the character at index `i` in string `s` is ']'.**
