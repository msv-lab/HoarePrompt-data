Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind - 1`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '|', then `ans` is either 5 or 6. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '|', then `ans` is either 4 or 5 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '|' or not, which in this case does not apply since it is not '|'.***
