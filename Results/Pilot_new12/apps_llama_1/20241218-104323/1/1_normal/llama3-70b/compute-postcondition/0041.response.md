Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' if such a sequence exists, otherwise -1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ':', then if `f` is `True`, `bind` is `n-1`, otherwise, `bind` is -1 and the state of the variables remains unchanged with `f` being `False`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not ':', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
