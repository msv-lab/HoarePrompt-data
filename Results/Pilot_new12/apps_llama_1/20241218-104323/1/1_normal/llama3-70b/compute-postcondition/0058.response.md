Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. The current value of `ind` is either -1 or was determined by operations outside this loop, and the current value of `bind` is either -1 or the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during the loop execution. The current state of the variables is such that either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1 (or both).**
