Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then the value -1 has been printed. If `ind` is less than `bind`, then `i` is `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans`, which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, has been printed.***
