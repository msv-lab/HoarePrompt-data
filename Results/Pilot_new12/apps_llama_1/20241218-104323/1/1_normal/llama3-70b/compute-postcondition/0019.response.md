Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` is 1, `f` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`.**
