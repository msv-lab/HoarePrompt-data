Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is -1, `f` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[' and the current value of the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement since `f` is False***
