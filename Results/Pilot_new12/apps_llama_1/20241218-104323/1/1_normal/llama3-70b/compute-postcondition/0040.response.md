Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the character at index `i` in string `s` is ':', if `f` is `True`, then `bind` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `f` being `False`, `ind` being the index of the first ':' after a '[' if such a sequence exists, otherwise -1, and `bind` being -1**
