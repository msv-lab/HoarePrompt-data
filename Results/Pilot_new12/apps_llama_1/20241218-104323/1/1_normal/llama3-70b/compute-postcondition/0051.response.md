The code initializes a new variable `f` and assigns it the value `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. 

The variable `s` is still the input string, `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still `n - 3`, and `ind` remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ind` remains the same, and `f` is `True`**
