Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', then the postcondition is the one of the if part. The if part postcondition is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` is 1, `f` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`. Since there is no else part in this case, we can conclude: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` is 1, `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not ':', then the initial values remain unchanged. So we have `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` is 1, `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not ':', the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not ':', the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`.***
