To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `s` is the input string
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `ind` is less than `bind`
- `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`
- `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during operations outside this loop
- `i` is `ind + 1`
- `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`
- `ans` is 4
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is '|'

The given code is:
```python
ans += 1
```

This code increments the value of `ans` by 1.

Given that `ans` is initially 4, after executing `ans += 1`, `ans` will be 5.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `s` is the input string
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `ind` is less than `bind`
- `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`
- `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during operations outside this loop
- `i` is `ind + 1`
- `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`
- `ans` is 5
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is '|'

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during operations outside this loop, `i` is `ind + 1`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, `ans` is 5, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is '|'**
