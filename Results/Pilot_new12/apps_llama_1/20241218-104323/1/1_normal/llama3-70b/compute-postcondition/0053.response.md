The code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ind` remains the same, `bind` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
