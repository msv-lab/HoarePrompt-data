Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during operations outside this loop, `i` is `ind + 1`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, if the current value of `s` at index `i` is '|', then `ans` is 5, otherwise `ans` remains 4***
