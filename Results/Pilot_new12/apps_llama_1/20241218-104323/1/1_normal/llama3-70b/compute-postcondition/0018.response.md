The `break` statement terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside of. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `ind` is 1, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `f` is `True`. Otherwise, `f` is `False` and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
