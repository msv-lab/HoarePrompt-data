The code `ind = i` updates the value of `ind` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `ind` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `ind` is 1, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `f` is `True`. Otherwise, `f` is `False` and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '['**
