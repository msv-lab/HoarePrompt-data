Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, and both `ind` and `bind` are as determined by operations outside this loop, `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during the loop execution. The current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to the current value of `bind`.**
