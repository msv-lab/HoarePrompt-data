Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `f` and `ind` states remain the same. If `s[i]` is '=', then no change occurs. If `s[i]` is ':', then if `f` is true, `bind` is set to `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of `bind` remains unchanged.***
