To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given loop statement:
```
for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
```
Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is the input string
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `ind` is less than `bind`
- `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`
- `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during operations outside this loop
- `i` is `ind + 1`
- `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`
- If the current value of `s` at index `i` is '|', then `ans` is 5, otherwise `ans` remains 4

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bind` because the loop iterates over the range from `ind + 1` to `bind`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `ind + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, thus becoming `ind + 2`.

The conditions on `ind`, `bind`, `s`, `n`, and `f` do not change within the loop's context given. However, since `i` increments, the relationship of `i` with `bind` and potentially the value of `ans` if it depends on the character at index `i` in `s` could change.

The adjusted states considering the increment of `i` would be:
- `s` remains the input string
- `n` remains the length of `s`
- `ind` is less than `bind - 1` because `i` has moved one step forward
- `bind` remains greater than `ind + 1` but now `i` is at `ind + 2`
- `i` is now `ind + 2`
- `f` remains unchanged as it's not impacted by the loop's iteration directly in the given context
- The value of `ans` could change based on the character at the new index `i` in `s`. If the character at the new `i` index is '|', `ans` would be 5; otherwise, it remains 4 or changes according to its previous value if it wasn't '|'.

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind - 1`, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, and `ans` is either 4 or 5 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '|' or not**
