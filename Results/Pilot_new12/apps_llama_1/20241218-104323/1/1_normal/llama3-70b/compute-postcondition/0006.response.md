The code changes the value of `f` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is -1, `f` is `True`, `i` is 0. The current value of the character at index `i` of string `s` is '['.
