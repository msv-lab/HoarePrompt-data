Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `f` state remains the same, `ind` state remains the same, if `f` is true, then `bind` is `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of `bind` is unchanged as there is no else part.**
