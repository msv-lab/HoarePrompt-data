Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of string `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':', then if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '[', `ind` is 1 and `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':' and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not ':' and not '[', then `ind` remains -1 and `f` is `False`.**
