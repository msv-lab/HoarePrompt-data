If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, then -1 has been printed to the console. If `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1, then if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 has been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an input string from the user, parses it to find the indices of specific characters, and prints the count of a particular character sequence if certain conditions are met. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, instead, it prints the result directly to the console. It looks for a sequence of '[' followed by ':' and then a sequence of ']' followed by ':' in the input string. If both sequences are found and the index of the first ':' after '[' is less than the index of the first ':' after ']', it counts the number of '|' characters between these two ':' characters and prints 4 plus this count. If the sequences are not found or the indices are not in the correct order, it prints -1. The function handles edge cases where the input string does not contain the required sequences, but it does not perform any error checking on the input string itself, such as checking for empty strings or strings with invalid characters. The final state of the program after execution will be that the input string has been parsed, and either the count of the '|' character sequence or -1 has been printed to the console, depending on the conditions met in the input string.
