You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, and possibly others, from which an accordion string can be formed by removing some characters.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, `f` is `True` if a '[' was encountered and not reset, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' if such a sequence exists, otherwise -1.
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, `ind` is as determined by operations outside this loop, `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists and was found during the loop execution, otherwise -1.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        if (ind >= bind) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            ans = 4
            for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    ans += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` is the index of the first ':' after a ']' if such a sequence exists, `i` is `bind - 1`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`, `ans` is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`.
            print(ans)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then the value -1 has been printed. If `ind` is less than `bind`, then `i` is `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans`, which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if ']' was found in `s`, otherwise `False`. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, then -1 has been printed to the console. If `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1, then if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is `bind - 1`, and the value of `ans`, which is 4 plus the number of '|' characters in `s` between indices `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an input string from the user, parses it to find the indices of specific characters, and prints the count of a particular character sequence if certain conditions are met. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, instead, it prints the result directly to the console. It looks for a sequence of '[' followed by ':' and then a sequence of ']' followed by ':' in the input string. If both sequences are found and the index of the first ':' after '[' is less than the index of the first ':' after ']', it counts the number of '|' characters between these two ':' characters and prints 4 plus this count. If the sequences are not found or the indices are not in the correct order, it prints -1. The function handles edge cases where the input string does not contain the required sequences, but it does not perform any error checking on the input string itself, such as checking for empty strings or strings with invalid characters. The final state of the program after execution will be that the input string has been parsed, and either the count of the '|' character sequence or -1 has been printed to the console, depending on the conditions met in the input string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
