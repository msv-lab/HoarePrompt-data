The given code snippet is a `break` statement. This statement will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

Since there are no changes made to any variables in the given code, all the variables (`s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, `start_colon`, `i`, `end_colon`) retain their values. 

The states of the variables are as follows: 
- `s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
- `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- `ind` is less than `bind`.
- `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`.
- `i` is `bind - 3`.
- `end_colon` is `bind - 3`.

We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, `i` is `bind - 3`, `end_colon` is `bind - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
