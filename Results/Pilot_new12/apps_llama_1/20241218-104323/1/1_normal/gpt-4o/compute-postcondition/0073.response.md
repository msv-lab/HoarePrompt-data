To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers.
- Neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1.
- `start_colon` is less than `end_colon - 1`.
- `i` equals `start_colon + 1`.
- The state of `pipe_count` depends on the character at index `i` in string `s`, but its current state isn't directly relevant to whether the loop continues or not.

Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(start_colon + 1, end_colon):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, and the condition `i < end_colon` must still be true. Since `i` starts at `start_colon + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented and is now at `start_colon + 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to continue:
- `i` must be `start_colon + 2`.
- Since `i` must be less than `end_colon` for the loop to continue, `start_colon + 2` must be less than `end_colon`.
- The state of `pipe_count` isn't directly influenced by the loop condition but might change depending on the character at index `i` in `s`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` equals `start_colon + 2`.
- `start_colon + 2` must be less than `end_colon`, implying `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 2`.

State: **`start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon - 2`, `i` equals `start_colon + 2`**
