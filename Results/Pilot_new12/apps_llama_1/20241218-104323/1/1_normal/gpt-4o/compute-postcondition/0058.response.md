The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
