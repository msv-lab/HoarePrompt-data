The code introduces a new variable `pipe_count` and assigns it the value 0. The initial state's conditions and variables `start_colon` and `end_colon` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. 

Output State: **`start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and `pipe_count` is 0**
