The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of `s` is between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), so the value of `n` will also be between 1 and 500000 (inclusive). The state of `s` is not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000**
