Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and if `s[i]` equals ']', then `bind` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `bind` remains -1.**
