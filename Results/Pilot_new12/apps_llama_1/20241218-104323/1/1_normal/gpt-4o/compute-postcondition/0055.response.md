Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, if `s[i]` (where `i` is `bind - 1`) is ':', then `end_colon` is `bind - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `end_colon` remains -1***
