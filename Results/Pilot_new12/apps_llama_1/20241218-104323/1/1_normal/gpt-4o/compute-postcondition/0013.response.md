The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ind`. Given the initial state, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2.

The value of `ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2**
