Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is either -1 or the index of the last ']' character in `s`. If `ind` equals -1, `bind` equals -1, or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then the value -1 is printed and returned. Otherwise, `start_colon` and `end_colon` have values. If at least one of the conditions is true: `start_colon` equals -1, `end_colon` equals -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, then the value -1 is returned. If none of the above conditions are true, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and the value of `result`, which equals 4 plus the number of '|' characters in string `s` from index `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`, is printed.***
