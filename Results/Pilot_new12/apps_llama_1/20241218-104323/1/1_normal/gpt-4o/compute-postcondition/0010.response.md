The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. Since the initial state does not provide information about the loop or conditional statement that the `break` statement is inside, we will assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, the `break` statement does not change the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, or `ind`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
