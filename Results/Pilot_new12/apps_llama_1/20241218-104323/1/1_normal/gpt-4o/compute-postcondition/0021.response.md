The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or switch statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
