Postcondition: **`start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon - 1`, `i` equals `start_colon + 1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `pipe_count` remains unchanged at 0.**
