Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 2, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `i` is `n-3`, if `s` at index `n-3` is ']', then `bind` is `n-3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
