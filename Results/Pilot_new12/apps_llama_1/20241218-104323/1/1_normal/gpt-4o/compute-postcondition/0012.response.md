According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
