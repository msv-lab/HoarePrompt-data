The code `bind = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bind`. Given that `i` is `n-3`, `bind` will be equal to `n-3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 2, `ind` is either -1 or the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `i` is `n-3`, `bind` is `n-3`**
