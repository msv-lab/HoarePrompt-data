To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive)
- `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`
- `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`
- `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`
- `ind` is not equal to -1
- `bind` is not equal to -1
- `ind` is less than `bind`
- If `s` at index `i` (which is `ind + 2`) is ':', then `start_colon` is `ind + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` at index `i` (which is `ind + 2`) is not ':', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Since the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `bind`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Given that the loop iterates over the range from `ind + 1` to `bind`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `bind`. 

So, if `i` is `ind + 2` at the end of the previous iteration (considering `ind + 2` is within the loop's range and assuming it's the first iteration or no colon was found), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `ind + 3`.

The state of `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind` remains unchanged as there is no operation in the given context that would alter these variables within the loop.

The state of `start_colon` is not explicitly mentioned as being updated in the given context unless `s` at index `i` is ':'. However, since `i` is being incremented and assuming that the condition for `start_colon` to be updated wasn't met (because if it were, the loop would break), the value of `start_colon` remains as it was unless the current `i` meets the condition for updating `start_colon`.

Considering the condition and the fact that `i` needs to be incremented for the loop to execute one more time, the adjusted states are as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 3`**
