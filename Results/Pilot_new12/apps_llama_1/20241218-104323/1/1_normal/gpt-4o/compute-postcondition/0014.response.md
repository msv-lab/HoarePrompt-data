The code `break` does not modify any variables, it only exits the most internal loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
