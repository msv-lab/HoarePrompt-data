According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `ind`, and `bind`. If `i` is less than `bind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 1`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, and `ind` is less than `bind`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `ind + 2`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `bind`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 2`, and `start_colon` remains -1 unless the character at index `ind + 1` in `s` is ':', in which case `start_colon` is `ind + 1`**
