Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`. If `s` at index `i` (which is `ind + 2`) is ':', then `start_colon` is `ind + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` at index `i` (which is `ind + 2`) is not ':', then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
