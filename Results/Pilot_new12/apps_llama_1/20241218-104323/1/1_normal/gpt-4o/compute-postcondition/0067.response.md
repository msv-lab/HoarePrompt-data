To find the postcondition, we first need to understand the precondition and the if condition. However, the precondition is missing from your task description. Based on the if condition provided, we can infer that the precondition likely involves `start_colon` and `end_colon` being integers or having some initial state. Given the if condition:

```python
if (start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon):
```

The negation of this condition, which would be true when the program enters the else block, is:

```python
start_colon!= -1 and end_colon!= -1 and start_colon < end_colon
```

Assuming the precondition mentions that `start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers (since a common context for such variables might involve string indexing or similar), the postcondition would include this information plus the negation of the if condition.

Postcondition: **`start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`.**
