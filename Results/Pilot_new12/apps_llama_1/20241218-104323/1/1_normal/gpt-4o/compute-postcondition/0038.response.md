The value of `start_colon` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is the index of the character ':' in `s` and is equal to `ind + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is ':'.
