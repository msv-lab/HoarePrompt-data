To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1)`. This means the loop will start from `bind - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches `ind` (but not including `ind` because the stop value in Python's range function is exclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).
- `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`.
- `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, and `ind` is not equal to -1.
- `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s`, and `bind` is not equal to -1.
- `ind` is less than `bind`.
- `start_colon` is either -1 if no colon is found in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, or the index of the first colon found in `s[ind + 1:bind]`.
- `end_colon` is -1.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met based on the loop statement:
1. `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind` because the loop iterates from `bind - 1` down to `ind` (excluding `ind`). Since `ind` is less than `bind`, this condition is inherently met.
2. `i` (the loop variable) will take values starting from `bind - 1` down to `ind + 1` (because the loop stops before reaching `ind`).

Considering these conditions and the given initial state, we need to ensure that:
- The loop can start, which means `bind - 1` must be a valid index for `s`, implying `bind` must be at least 1 (which is guaranteed since `bind` is less than `n` and `n` is between 1 and 500000).
- The loop will iterate over indices that are within the bounds of `s`, which is guaranteed because `ind` and `bind` are indices within `s`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to reflect that `i` is initially `bind - 1`, and the loop iterates backwards. The conditions related to `ind`, `bind`, and their relationship are already met by the initial state.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, `end_colon` is -1, and `i` is `bind - 1`**
