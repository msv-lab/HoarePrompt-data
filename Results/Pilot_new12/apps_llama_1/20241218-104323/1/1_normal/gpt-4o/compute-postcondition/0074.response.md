The code increments the value of `pipe_count` by 1. The initial values of `start_colon`, `end_colon`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. 

`start_colon` and `end_colon` are still integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon - 2`. The value of `i` is still equal to `start_colon + 2`. 

The only change is that `pipe_count` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`start_colon` and `end_colon` are integers, neither `start_colon` nor `end_colon` is -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon - 2`, `i` equals `start_colon + 2`, `pipe_count` is incremented by 1**
