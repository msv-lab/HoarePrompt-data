According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `bind`, and `ind`. If `i` is greater than `ind`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `bind - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `bind - 2`. 
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` with lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first colon in `s[ind + 1:bind]`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is either -1 or `bind - 1`**
