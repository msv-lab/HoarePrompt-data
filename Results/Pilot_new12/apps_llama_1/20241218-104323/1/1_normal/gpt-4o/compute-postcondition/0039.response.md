The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. In this case, since there are no changes made to the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, `i`, or `start_colon` within the `break` statement, their values remain the same after the execution of the statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, the character at index `i` in `s` is ':', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
