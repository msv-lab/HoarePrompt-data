The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. Since there are no changes to any variables in the code snippet, all variable values remain the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 3`, `start_colon` is `ind + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
