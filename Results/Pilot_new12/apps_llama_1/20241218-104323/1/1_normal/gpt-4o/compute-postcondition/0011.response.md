Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '[', then `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is not '[', then the state of `ind` remains unchanged as there is no specified action for the else part.***
