Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in the original string `s`, `bind` is the index of the last ']' character in `s` and is at least `ind + 2`, `ind` is not equal to -1, `bind` is not equal to -1, `ind` is less than `bind`. If the character at index `ind + 1` in `s` is ':', then `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `ind + 1` in `s` is not ':', then the state of the variables is unchanged, with `i` remaining `ind + 1` and `start_colon` remaining -1.***
