Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) and must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s` at index 2 is '[', then `ind` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` at index 2 is not '[', then the state of the program variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to execute.***
