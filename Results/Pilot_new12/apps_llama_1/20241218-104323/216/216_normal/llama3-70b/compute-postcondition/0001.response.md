The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to `s`. This means that `s` is no longer an unread string, but rather a string that has been read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is the input string read from the user, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters that were entered by the user, since the actual length of `s` is now determined by the user's input.**
