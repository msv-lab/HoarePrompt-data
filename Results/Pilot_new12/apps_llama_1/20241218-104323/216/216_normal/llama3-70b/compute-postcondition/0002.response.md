The code creates a new list called `lowercase` that stores the indices of the characters in the string `s` that are in lowercase. 

The list comprehension iterates over the string `s` and checks each character `c` to see if it is a lowercase letter using the `islower` method. If it is, the index `i` of that character is added to the `lowercase` list.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The string `s` also remains unchanged, as the code only iterates over it and does not modify it in any way.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is the input string read from the user, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters that were entered by the user, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`.
