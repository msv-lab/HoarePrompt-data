Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a string s of length n as input, where n is between 1 and 200, and s consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It counts the number of lowercase letters in the string s and prints this count. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None) and modifies the standard output by printing the count of lowercase letters. The input variables n and s are not modified by the function. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the input operation, such as non-integer input for n or a string s that does not match the specified length or character set. After the function concludes, the program state is updated with the printed count of lowercase letters and the input variables n and s are available in the local scope of the function.**
