Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string and prints this count. However, according to the problem description, a "pretty set" of positions requires that:

1. Letters on positions from the set in the string are all distinct and lowercase.
2. There are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from the set.

The current program does not consider these conditions. For example, if the input string is "aaaa", the program will incorrectly print 4, while the correct answer should be 1, because all 'a's are the same character and only one position can be included in the pretty set.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible subsets of lowercase letter positions, check if the letters at these positions are distinct and if there are no uppercase letters between them, and then print the maximum size of such a subset.

Here is an example of a corrected program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    
    max_size = 0
    for mask in range(1 << len(lowercase)):
        positions = [lowercase[i] for i in range(len(lowercase)) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        if positions:
            letters = [s[i] for i in positions]
            if len(set(letters)) == len(letters):
                valid = True
                positions.sort()
                for i in range(len(positions) - 1):
                    for j in range(positions[i] + 1, positions[i + 1]):
                        if s[j].isupper():
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if not valid:
                        break
                if valid:
                    max_size = max(max_size, len(positions))
    
    print(max_size)

func()
```
This corrected program checks all possible subsets of lowercase letter positions and updates the maximum size of a pretty set accordingly.
