Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not guarantee that the conditions for a "pretty set" are met.

For example, consider the input string "aAa". The program would output 2, which is incorrect because there is no way to choose two positions such that there are no uppercase letters between them. The correct output for this input would be 1.

The program does not check for the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the chosen positions, which is a crucial part of the problem description. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

A correct solution would involve using a more complex algorithm, such as a dynamic programming approach, to keep track of the maximum number of positions that can be chosen while satisfying the conditions of a "pretty set". 

Here's an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        count = 0
        last_pos = -1
        valid = True
        distinct_letters = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)):
                if s[i].isupper():
                    valid = False
                    break
                if s[i] in distinct_letters:
                    valid = False
                    break
                distinct_letters.add(s[i])
                count += 1
                if last_pos!= -1:
                    for j in range(last_pos + 1, i):
                        if s[j].isupper():
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if not valid:
                        break
                last_pos = i
        if valid:
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
    print(max_count)
