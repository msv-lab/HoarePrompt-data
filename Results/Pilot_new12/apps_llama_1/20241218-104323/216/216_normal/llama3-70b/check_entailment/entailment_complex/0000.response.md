Correctness: **False**

The function does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to determine the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set of positions" for the given string s, where a pretty set of positions A has the following conditions:

1. Letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase.
2. There are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A.

However, the provided function simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string s and prints this count. This does not take into account the conditions of a pretty set of positions.

For example, if the input string is "aaaaBaabAbA", the function will print 9 (the total number of lowercase letters), but the correct output should be 2, because the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions is 2 (e.g., positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8).

The function does not consider the condition that letters on positions from A must be distinct and that there should be no uppercase letters between positions from A. Therefore, it does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description.

To solve this problem correctly, the function would need to implement a more complex algorithm that checks all possible combinations of positions in the string and verifies whether they meet the conditions of a pretty set of positions.
