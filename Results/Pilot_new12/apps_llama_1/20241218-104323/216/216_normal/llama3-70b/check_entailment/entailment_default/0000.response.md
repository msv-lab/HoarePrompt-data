Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not check if the letters are distinct or if there are uppercase letters between them. 

For example, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the code will print 8, which is the total number of lowercase letters, but the correct answer is 2, because the only way to choose a pretty set of positions is to choose positions 6 and 8 or 7 and 8, where the letters are 'a' and 'b', and there are no uppercase letters between them.

Another example is the input "zACaAbbaazzC", where the code will print 8, but the correct answer is 3, because there are several ways to choose a pretty set of positions, such as positions 7, 8, and 11, where the letters are 'a', 'b', and 'z', and there are no uppercase letters between them.

The code needs to be modified to correctly implement the problem description, such as by checking for distinct letters and the absence of uppercase letters between them. 

Here is a possible modification:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_len = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        letters = [s[i] for i in positions]
        if len(set(letters))!= len(letters) or not all(c.islower() for c in letters):
            continue
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(positions) - 1):
            for j in range(positions[i] + 1, positions[i + 1]):
                if s[j].isupper():
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            max_len = max(max_len, len(positions))
    print(max_len)
```
This code generates all possible subsets of positions, checks if the letters at these positions are distinct and lowercase, and if there are no uppercase letters between them. If a subset meets these conditions, it updates the maximum length. The code then prints the maximum length found.
