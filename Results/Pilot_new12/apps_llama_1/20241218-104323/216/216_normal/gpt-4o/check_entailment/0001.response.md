Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. It iterates over the input string, maintaining a set of unique lowercase characters and a count of these characters. When it encounters an uppercase character, it updates the maximum count if necessary, resets the set and count, and continues. After iterating over the entire string, it updates the maximum count one last time to account for the last sequence of lowercase characters.

The code correctly handles the conditions for a "pretty set" of positions:

1. It ensures that the letters on positions from the set in the string are all distinct and lowercase by using a set to store unique lowercase characters.
2. It ensures that there are no uppercase letters in the string situated between positions from the set by resetting the set and count when it encounters an uppercase character.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided examples are also correctly handled by the program, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs.
