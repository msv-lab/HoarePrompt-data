You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to correctly determine the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set" of positions. It iterates over the string, adding lowercase characters to a set if they are not already present. If an uppercase character is encountered, it updates the maximum count if the current count is greater, then resets the current set and count. This ensures that the set only includes lowercase characters, and there are no uppercase characters between the positions in the set.

The program handles the edge cases, such as a string with no lowercase characters (in which case it correctly outputs 0), and a string with multiple segments of lowercase characters separated by uppercase characters (in which case it correctly outputs the maximum length of these segments).

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it only needs to iterate over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, it might need to store all characters in the set.

I couldn't find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n representing the length of the string s, and a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, where 1 <= n <= 200 and the length of s is equal to n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters separated by non-lowercase characters, `current_set` is either an empty set (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or contains the unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character, and `current_count` is either 0 (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or the count of unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then calculates and prints the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters separated by non-lowercase characters in the string `s`. The function considers all substrings of `s` separated by non-lowercase characters and keeps track of the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in these substrings. The final state of the program includes the printed maximum count of unique lowercase letters, and the input variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the string `s` starts or ends with a non-lowercase character, or contains consecutive non-lowercase characters, and correctly updates the maximum count accordingly. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the result to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
