The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` is overwritten by this operation. 

Since `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, the output state will have `n` as an input integer.

However, we should note that the initial state has more information: it mentions that the input consists of an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, where `1 <= n <= 200` and the length of `s` is equal to `n`. But this information about `n` being the length of `s` is not valid after the code `n = int(input())` is executed because `n` is reassigned.

So, the output state will be: `n` is an input integer. The string `s` still consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
