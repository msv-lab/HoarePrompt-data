The print statement does not change the values of any variables, it simply outputs the current value of `max_count`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an input integer, `s` is still the input string, `max_count` is still the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is still either an empty set or contains the unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character, and `current_count` is still either 0 or the count of unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character. 
The variable `max_count` has been returned at the output state.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `max_count` has been returned and is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is either an empty set or contains the unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character, and `current_count` is either 0 or the count of unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character**
