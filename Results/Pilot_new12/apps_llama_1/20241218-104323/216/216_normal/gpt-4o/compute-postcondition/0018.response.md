The code increments `current_count` by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is undetermined, so its new value is also undetermined but 1 more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains the second character of `s`, and `current_count` is `current_count` + 1**
