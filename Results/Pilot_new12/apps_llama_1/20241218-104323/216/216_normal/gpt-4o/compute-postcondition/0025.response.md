To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. 

The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the `char` to the `current_set`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a string with at least 3 characters
- `char` is the third character of `s`
- `max_count` is 0

The code only affects `current_set` by adding `char` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`**
