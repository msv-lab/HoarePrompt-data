Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `max_count` is 0. If the second character of `s` is lowercase, then `current_set` contains the second character of `s` if it was not already present, and `current_count` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `s` is not lowercase, then `current_set` is empty and `current_count` is 0.***
