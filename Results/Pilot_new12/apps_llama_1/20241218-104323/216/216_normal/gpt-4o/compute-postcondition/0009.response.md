The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` was 0, so the new value of `current_count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in `s`, `current_count` is 1, `char` is the first character in `s`, the current value of `char` is a lowercase letter, and `char` is in `current_set`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in `s`, `current_count` is 1, `char` is the first character in `s`, the current value of `char` is a lowercase letter, and `char` is in `current_set`**
