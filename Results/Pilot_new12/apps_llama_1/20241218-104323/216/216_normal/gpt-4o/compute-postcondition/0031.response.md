Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is lowercase, then if `char` is not in `current_set`, `current_set` contains `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1, and `max_count` is 0. If `char` is in `current_set`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `char` is not lowercase, then `current_count` is 0, `max_count` is 0, and `current_set` is an empty set.***
