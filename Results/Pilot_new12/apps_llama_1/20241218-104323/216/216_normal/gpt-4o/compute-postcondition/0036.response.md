Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It then calculates and prints the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters separated by non-lowercase characters in the string `s`. The function considers all substrings of `s` separated by non-lowercase characters and keeps track of the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in these substrings. The final state of the program includes the printed maximum count of unique lowercase letters, and the input variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the string `s` starts or ends with a non-lowercase character, or contains consecutive non-lowercase characters, and correctly updates the maximum count accordingly. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the result to the console.**
