The code `current_count = 0` sets the value of `current_count` to 0.

The value of `max_count` is the maximum of 0 and `current_count`. Since `current_count` is now 0, `max_count` will be 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
