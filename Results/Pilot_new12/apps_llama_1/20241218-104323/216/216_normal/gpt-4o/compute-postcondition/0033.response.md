The code `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)` updates the value of `max_count` to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is the input string
- `max_count` is the maximum count of consecutive unique lowercase letters separated by non-lowercase characters
- `current_set` is either an empty set (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or contains the unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character
- `current_count` is either 0 (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or the count of unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character

The new `max_count` will be equal to the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`, `current_set` is either an empty set (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or contains the unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character, and `current_count` is either 0 (if `s` ends with a non-lowercase character) or the count of unique lowercase letters after the last non-lowercase character**
