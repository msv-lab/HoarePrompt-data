The code resets the value of `current_count` to 0. The previous value of `current_count` is not relevant as it is being reassigned. The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, and `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is not a lowercase letter.
