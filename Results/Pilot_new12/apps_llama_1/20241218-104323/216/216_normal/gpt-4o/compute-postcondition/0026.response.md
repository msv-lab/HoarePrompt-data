The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `current_count` is unknown, but since `current_set` contains `char`, it can be inferred that `current_count` has been initialized and is at least 1, given the context. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1**
