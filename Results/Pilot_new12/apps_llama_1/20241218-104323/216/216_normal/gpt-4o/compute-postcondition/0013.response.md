The code `current_set.clear()` removes all elements from `current_set`. Since `current_set` was initially an empty set, it remains an empty set after the execution of the code. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is not a lowercase letter**
