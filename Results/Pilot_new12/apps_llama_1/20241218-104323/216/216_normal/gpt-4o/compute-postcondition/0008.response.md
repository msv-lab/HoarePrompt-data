The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the value of `char` to the `current_set`. The previous value of `current_set` is an empty set, and the value of `char` is the first character in `s`, which is a lowercase letter. 

Therefore, after the code is executed, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the first character in `s`, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, the current value of `char` is a lowercase letter, and `char` is in `current_set`**
