Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, if `char` (the first character in `s`) is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is in `current_set`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, `max_count` is 0, and `current_count` is 0***
