To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. 

The initial state is given as: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is the newly input string
- `max_count` is 0
- `current_set` is an empty set
- `current_count` is 0

Given the loop `for char in s:`, the loop will iterate over each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be empty, meaning it must have at least one character. The state of `char` before the loop starts would be the first character in `s`, assuming `s` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`**
