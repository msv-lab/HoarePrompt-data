Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1, and `max_count` is 0. If `char` is in `current_set`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
