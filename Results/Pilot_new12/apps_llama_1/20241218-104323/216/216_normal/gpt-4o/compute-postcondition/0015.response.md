Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `max_count` is 0. If `char` (the first character in `s`) is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is in `current_set`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, then the state remains unchanged, `current_count` is 0. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, and `char` is the first character in `s` which is not a lowercase letter.**
