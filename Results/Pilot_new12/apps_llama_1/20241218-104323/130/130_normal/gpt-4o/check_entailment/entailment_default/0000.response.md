Correctness: **True**.

The program calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to Ivan such that all three conditions are met: each friend gifts the same number of coins, all coins gifted are different, and at least L coins are new to Ivan's collection. 

The code correctly calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that at least L coins are new to Ivan's collection. 

Then it checks if `M * min_x` (the total number of coins gifted by all friends) does not exceed the available different coins (`N - K`). If it does not exceed, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. 

If `M * min_x` exceeds the available different coins, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to meet all three conditions.

The provided examples are correctly handled by the program. For example, when the input is `20 15 2 3`, the program correctly prints `1`, because each friend can gift 1 coin, resulting in 15 different coins, at least 13 of which are new to Ivan's collection. 

Similarly, when the input is `10 11 2 4`, the program correctly prints `-1`, because it is impossible for 11 friends to gift different coins when there are only 10 different coins available.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, assuming that the input values are valid and provided through standard input, separated by spaces.
