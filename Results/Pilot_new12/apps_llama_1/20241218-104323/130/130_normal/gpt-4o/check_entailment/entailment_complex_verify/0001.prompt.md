You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions.

The key insight is that each friend should give the same number of coins, and all coins given to Ivan must be different. The program calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift (`min_x`) by dividing the number of new coins required (`L`) by the number of friends (`M`) and rounding up to the nearest integer. This ensures that at least `L` new coins are given to Ivan.

The program then checks if it is possible to satisfy all the conditions by checking if the total number of coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). If this condition is true, the program prints the minimum number of coins one friend can gift (`min_x`). Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem statement. For example, in the first test case, `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`. The program calculates `min_x = (3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`, and since `15 * 1 <= 20 - 2`, it prints `1`. In the second test case, `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`. The program calculates `min_x = (4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`, but since `11 * 1 > 10 - 2`, it prints `-1`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are integers, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, 1 <= L, and 1 <= K <= 10^18, 1 <= M <= 10^18, and 1 <= L <= 10^18.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
        print(min_x)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer, and `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x <= N - K`, the value of `min_x` has been printed. Otherwise, the value -1 has been returned as output, indicating `M * min_x > N - K`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the minimum number of items (`min_x`) that need to be added to a set of `N` items, given `M` items can be added at a time, `K` items are reserved and cannot be removed, and `L` items are required in total. It takes four integer parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, where `1 <= K <= N`, `1 <= M`, `1 <= L`, and `1 <= K, M, L <= 10^18`. If the minimum number of items to add (`min_x`) does not exceed the available space (`N - K`), the function prints the value of `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that there is not enough space to add the required number of items. The function assumes that the input values are provided through standard input, separated by spaces. The program state after execution will have either the minimum number of items to add or `-1` printed to the output, depending on whether the required items can fit within the available space.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
