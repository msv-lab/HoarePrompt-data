Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to satisfy the given conditions.

Here's why:

1. The program calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift (`min_x`) as `(L + M - 1) // M`. This is because each friend must gift at least `min_x` coins to ensure that the total number of new coins is at least `L`. The `(L + M - 1) // M` formula is a ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest integer, ensuring that `min_x` is sufficient to meet the `L` condition.

2. The program then checks if `M * min_x <= N - K`. This condition ensures that the total number of coins gifted by all friends (`M * min_x`) does not exceed the number of coins that Ivan does not already have (`N - K`). If this condition is true, it means that it is possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins without exceeding the available coins.

3. If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is true, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to satisfy the conditions.

4. If the condition `M * min_x <= N - K` is false, it means that it is not possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins without exceeding the available coins. In this case, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to meet all the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description. It takes into account the minimum number of coins required to meet the `L` condition, the number of friends, and the available coins, and returns the correct result.
