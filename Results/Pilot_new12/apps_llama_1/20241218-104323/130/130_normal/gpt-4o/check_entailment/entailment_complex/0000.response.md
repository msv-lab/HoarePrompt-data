Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The problem description states that each friend must gift the same number of coins, so we need to find the minimum number of coins each friend must gift.
2. The problem also states that all coins given to Ivan must be different, which means that the total number of coins given to Ivan must be less than or equal to the total number of different coins available (N).
3. Additionally, the problem requires that at least L coins must be new in Ivan's collection.
4. The program calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to ensure that at least L coins are new in Ivan's collection.
5. The program then checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. If it is, then it's possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins, and the program prints `min_x`. If not, then it's not possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins, and the program prints -1.

The program's logic matches the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift and checks if it's possible to gift that many coins.

For example, in the case where N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, and L = 3, the program calculates `min_x` as `(3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`. Since `15 * 1 = 15` is less than `20 - 2 = 18`, the program prints 1, which is correct according to the problem description.

Similarly, in the case where N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, and L = 4, the program calculates `min_x` as `(4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`. Since `11 * 1 = 11` is greater than `10 - 2 = 8`, the program prints -1, which is also correct according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says for every potential case.
