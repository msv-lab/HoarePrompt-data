Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions.

The key insight is that each friend should give the same number of coins, and all coins given to Ivan must be different. The program calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift (`min_x`) by dividing the number of new coins required (`L`) by the number of friends (`M`) and rounding up to the nearest integer. This ensures that at least `L` new coins are given to Ivan.

The program then checks if it is possible to satisfy all the conditions by checking if the total number of coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). If this condition is true, the program prints the minimum number of coins one friend can gift (`min_x`). Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem statement. For example, in the first test case, `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`. The program calculates `min_x = (3 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`, and since `15 * 1 <= 20 - 2`, it prints `1`. In the second test case, `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`. The program calculates `min_x = (4 + 11 - 1) // 11 = 1`, but since `11 * 1 > 10 - 2`, it prints `-1`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
