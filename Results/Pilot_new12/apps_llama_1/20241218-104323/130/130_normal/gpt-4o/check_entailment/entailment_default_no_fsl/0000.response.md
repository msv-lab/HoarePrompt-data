Correctness: **True**

The program calculates the minimum number of coins (`min_x`) that need to be added to Ivan's collection, given that `M` friends are adding coins at a time, `K` coins are already in Ivan's collection and cannot be removed, and `L` coins are required to be new in Ivan's collection.

The formula `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` correctly calculates the minimum number of coins that need to be added per friend, ensuring that `L` coins are new in Ivan's collection.

The condition `M * min_x <= N - K` checks whether it is possible to add `M * min_x` coins to Ivan's collection without exceeding the total number of different coins `N`. If this condition is met, the program prints the value of `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to meet the conditions.

The program correctly handles the edge cases. For example, when `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`, the program correctly outputs `1`, as explained in the problem description.

Another example is when `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`, the program correctly outputs `-1`, as it is not possible for all friends to gift different coins.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles the edge cases, it is correct for every potential case.
