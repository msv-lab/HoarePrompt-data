You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are integers, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, 1 <= L, and 1 <= K <= 10^18, 1 <= M <= 10^18, and 1 <= L <= 10^18.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
        print(min_x)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer, and `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x <= N - K`, the value of `min_x` has been printed. Otherwise, the value -1 has been returned as output, indicating `M * min_x > N - K`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the minimum number of items (`min_x`) that need to be added to a set of `N` items, given `M` items can be added at a time, `K` items are reserved and cannot be removed, and `L` items are required in total. It takes four integer parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, where `1 <= K <= N`, `1 <= M`, `1 <= L`, and `1 <= K, M, L <= 10^18`. If the minimum number of items to add (`min_x`) does not exceed the available space (`N - K`), the function prints the value of `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that there is not enough space to add the required number of items. The function assumes that the input values are provided through standard input, separated by spaces. The program state after execution will have either the minimum number of items to add or `-1` printed to the output, depending on whether the required items can fit within the available space.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
