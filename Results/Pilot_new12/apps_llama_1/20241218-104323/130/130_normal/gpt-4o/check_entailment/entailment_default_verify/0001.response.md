The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. It calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift by dividing the number of new coins required by the number of friends and rounding up to the nearest integer. This ensures that at least the required number of new coins are given to Ivan.

The output hints provided confirm this understanding, as they describe the function's behavior in calculating and returning the minimum number of items that need to be added to a set of items, given certain constraints. The hints align with the problem description and the program's logic.

The program's assumption that the input values are valid and provided through standard input, separated by spaces, is also acceptable based on the given problem description and the output hints, which state that the input will be valid.

Therefore, after analyzing the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all specified constraints and conditions as expected.

Final: **True**
