The function `func` does not accept any parameters. 

However, based on the provided Parameter constraints: N, M, K, and L are integers, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, 1 <= L, and 1 <= K <= 10^18, 1 <= M <= 10^18, and 1 <= L <= 10^18, it seems that the function should accept four parameters N, M, K, and L. 

Assuming the function accepts these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

The function `func` accepts parameters N, M, K, and L. N, M, K, and L are integers, where 1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, 1 <= L, and 1 <= K <= 10^18, 1 <= M <= 10^18, and 1 <= L <= 10^18. 

However, since the output is not specified, we cannot provide the return value of the function.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, M, K, and L, which are integers with the given constraints, but the return value is not specified.**
