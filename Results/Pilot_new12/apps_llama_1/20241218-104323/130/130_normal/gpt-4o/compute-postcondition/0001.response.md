The code uses the `map` function to apply the `int` function to each item in the list returned by `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings separated by whitespace. The results are then unpacked into the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`.

Given that `input` equals `sys.stdin.read`, the input will be read from standard input.

The initial state constraints that `1 <= K <= N`, `1 <= M`, `1 <= L`, and the upper bounds of `K`, `M`, and `L` are less than or equal to `10^18` are still valid after the code has been executed.

The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are now the integer values of the first, second, third, and fourth items in the input, respectively.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `L` is an input integer, `1 <= K <= N`, `1 <= M`, `1 <= L`, `N <= 10^18`, `M <= 10^18`, `L <= 10^18`, and `K <= 10^18`**
