The given code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs -1. This statement does not modify any variables but returns the value -1 as output.

The values of the variables do not change, so `N` is still an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer, and `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`. Additionally, `M * min_x` is still greater than `N - K`.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer, `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`, `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, and the value -1 has been returned as output.**
