Postcondition: **`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer. The current value of `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`. `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` have the aforementioned properties, and the current relationship between `M`, `min_x`, `N`, and `K` is such that `M` times `min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`.**
