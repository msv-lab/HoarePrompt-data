Postcondition: ***`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer with `1 <= K <= N`, `L` is an input integer, and `min_x` equals `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x <= N - K`, the value of `min_x` has been printed. Otherwise, the value -1 has been returned as output, indicating `M * min_x > N - K`.***
