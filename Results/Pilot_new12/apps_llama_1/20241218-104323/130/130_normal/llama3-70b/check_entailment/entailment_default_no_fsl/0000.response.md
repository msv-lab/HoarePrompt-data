Correctness: **False**

The given program does not satisfy all the conditions described in the problem. It correctly checks if the number of friends is greater than or equal to the number of new coins Ivan must receive (`M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`), but it does not consider the minimum number of coins each friend must give to satisfy the condition of not less than `L` coins being new.

The program always prints 1 if the conditions `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L` are met, but this may not be the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give. For example, if `N = 100`, `M = 10`, `K = 50`, and `L = 50`, the program will print 1, but in this case, each friend would need to give at least 5 coins to satisfy the condition of not less than 50 new coins.

The correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give, taking into account the number of new coins Ivan must receive and the number of friends. If such a minimum number of coins is less than or equal to the available coins (`N - K`), then it is possible to find a combination of coins that satisfies all conditions. Otherwise, the program should print -1. 

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not provide the minimum number of coins each friend must give to satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, its correctness is False.
