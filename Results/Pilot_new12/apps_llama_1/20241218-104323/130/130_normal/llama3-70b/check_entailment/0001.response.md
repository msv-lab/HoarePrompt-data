Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if it's possible to give Ivan `M` different coins that he doesn't have, which is a necessary condition. However, the condition `M >= L` is not sufficient to ensure that at least `L` coins from the gifts are new in Ivan's collection.

A counterexample is when `N = 10`, `M = 5`, `K = 8`, and `L = 3`. In this case, `M >= N - K + 1` is `True` because `5 >= 10 - 8 + 1`, and `M >= L` is also `True` because `5 >= 3`. The program will print `1`, which means each friend should give 1 coin. However, it's possible that all 5 friends give the same 2 coins that Ivan already has, and 3 new coins. In this case, the number of new coins is 3, which meets the condition `L = 3`. But if each friend gives only 1 coin, it's possible that Ivan gets fewer than 3 new coins.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where all friends give the same coins that Ivan already has. We need to find the minimum number of coins each friend should give to ensure that Ivan gets at least `L` new coins. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M > N:
        print(-1)
    elif (N - K) >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1 if (L - (N - K)) > (M * (math.floor(L / M) + 1)) else math.ceil(L / M))
```
