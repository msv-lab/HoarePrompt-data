The original assessment states that the program is correct. However, upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, I noticed that the code does not fully cover all the conditions specified in the problem description.

The code checks two conditions: `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`. While these conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient to guarantee that the friends can gift Ivan at least `L` new coins. 

The problem description states that not less than `L` coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection. However, the code does not take into account the worst-case scenario where Ivan already has a large portion of the coins, and the friends might not be able to gift him `L` new coins even if `M >= L`.

To fix this, we need to consider the intersection of the sets of coins that Ivan already has and the coins that the friends can gift him. The correct condition should be `N - K + 1 >= L` to ensure that there are enough coins that Ivan does not have, and `M >= L` to ensure that each friend can gift at least one coin.

The code should be modified to check these conditions correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.

Final: **False**
