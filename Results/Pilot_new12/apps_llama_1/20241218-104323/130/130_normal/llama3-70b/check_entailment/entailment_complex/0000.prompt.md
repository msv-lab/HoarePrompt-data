You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K, and N, M, K, L >= 0 and N, M, K, L are within the range of 1 to 10^18.
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is false and the value -1 has been returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from user input, checks if the conditions M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L are met, and prints 1 if both conditions are true; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but modifies the program's output based on the input integers. After execution, the program's state is determined by the printed value, which is either 1, indicating that the input conditions are satisfied, or -1, indicating that the conditions are not met. The function's operation is based on the constraints of the input integers, but it does not validate these constraints beyond what is specified in the conditional statement. The function's functionality implicitly assumes that the input integers are within the specified ranges (1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K, and N, M, K, L >= 0), but it does not explicitly enforce these constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
