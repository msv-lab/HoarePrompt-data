Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The condition `if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions.

The condition checks if the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` (the number of new coins that can be given) and if `M` is greater than or equal to `L` (the minimum number of new coins required). However, it does not consider the case where `M` is less than `N - K + 1`, but each friend can still give more than one coin to satisfy the conditions.

For example, consider the input `N = 10, M = 2, K = 5, L = 3`. The program will print `-1` because `M` is not greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `L`. However, each friend can give 2 coins to satisfy the conditions, resulting in a total of 4 new coins, which is5  more than the minimum required `L = 3`.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible cases, including when the friends need to give more than one coin to satisfy the conditions. The program should calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to ensure that at least `L` new coins are given, while also ensuring that each friend gives the same number of coins and that all coins given are different.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to consider the following cases:

- If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then each friend can give 1 coin, and the condition is satisfied.
- If `M` is less than `N - K + 1` but `M * (N - K) / M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then each friend can give `(N - K) / M` coins, and the condition is satisfied.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, then it is not possible to satisfy the conditions, and the program should print `-1`.

The current program does not cover these cases correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
