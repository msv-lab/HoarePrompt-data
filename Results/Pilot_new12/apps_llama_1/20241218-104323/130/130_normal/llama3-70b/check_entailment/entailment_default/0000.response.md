Correctness: **True**.

The code provided seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It checks two conditions: 

1. If the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan does not have yet (`N - K + 1`), because each friend must give a different coin. 

2. If the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the minimum number of new coins (`L`) that Ivan must receive.

If both conditions are met, the code prints 1, indicating that each friend can give one coin to satisfy the conditions. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the program's functionality. The code does not handle invalid inputs, but according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, in the first example, `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 2`, and `L = 3`, the code correctly prints 1 because each friend can give one coin to satisfy the conditions. In the second example, `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`, the code correctly prints -1 because it is impossible for all friends to give different coins.

Overall, the code seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description, and it works correctly for every potential case.
