Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func()` seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. 

It checks if it's possible for Ivan's friends to gift him the required number of new coins while satisfying the conditions of gifting the same number of coins and having at least L new coins.

Here's a breakdown of the conditions checked by the code:

- `M >= N - K + 1`: This ensures that there are enough friends to gift Ivan at least N - K + 1 different coins (since a friend can gift at most one coin that is not in Ivan's collection, and there are N - K coins not in Ivan's collection). The "+1" accounts for the possibility that Ivan already has one of the coins that would be gifted.

- `M >= L`: This ensures that there are enough friends to gift Ivan at least L new coins.

If both conditions are met, the function prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift one coin. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

The code seems to handle all edge cases correctly, including when M, N, K, or L have edge values (e.g., when M = 1, or when N = K, etc.). 

No counterexamples were found where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the code appears to be correct.
