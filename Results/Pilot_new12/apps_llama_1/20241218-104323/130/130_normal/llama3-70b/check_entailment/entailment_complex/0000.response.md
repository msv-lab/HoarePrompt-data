Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan such that all coins are different, all friends gift the same number of coins, and at least L coins are new to Ivan's collection. 

The program checks two conditions: `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`. If both conditions are met, it prints 1, indicating that each friend can gift 1 coin. However, this does not necessarily mean that the conditions of the problem are met. 

For example, consider the case where `N = 10`, `M = 5`, `K = 5`, and `L = 3`. In this case, the program will print 1, because `M >= N - K + 1` (5 >= 6) is false but `M >= L` (5 >= 3) is true and also `M >= N - K + 1` is false so the second condition is not checked since `and` operator in python is a short-circuit operator. However, if each friend gifts 1 coin, Ivan will receive at most 5 new coins, which is less than the required L = 3 new coins is not the problem here since we are checking for the minimum number of coins but we are also checking if all friends can give the same number of coins and if that number of coins will be different. 

The problem description does not guarantee that the minimum number of coins to satisfy all conditions is 1. The program should check all possible numbers of coins that each friend can gift and find the minimum number that satisfies all conditions.

A correct program would need to find the smallest integer `x` such that `M * x >= L` (to ensure at least L new coins) and `M * x <= N - K + M` (to ensure all coins can be different), and if no such `x` exists, print -1. 

The given program does not consider these conditions correctly and therefore does not solve the problem as described.
