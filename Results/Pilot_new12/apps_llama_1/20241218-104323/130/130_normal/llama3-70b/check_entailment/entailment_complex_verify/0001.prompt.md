You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if it's possible to give Ivan `M` different coins that he doesn't have, which is a necessary condition. However, the condition `M >= L` is not sufficient to ensure that at least `L` coins from the gifts are new in Ivan's collection.

A counterexample is when `N = 10`, `M = 5`, `K = 8`, and `L = 3`. In this case, `M >= N - K + 1` is `True` because `5 >= 10 - 8 + 1`, and `M >= L` is also `True` because `5 >= 3`. The program will print `1`, which means each friend should give 1 coin. However, it's possible that all 5 friends give the same 2 coins that Ivan already has, and 3 new coins. In this case, the number of new coins is 3, which meets the condition `L = 3`. But if each friend gives only 1 coin, it's possible that Ivan gets fewer than 3 new coins.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where all friends give the same coins that Ivan already has. We need to find the minimum number of coins each friend should give to ensure that Ivan gets at least `L` new coins. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M > N:
        print(-1)
    elif (N - K) >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1 if (L - (N - K)) > (M * (math.floor(L / M) + 1)) else math.ceil(L / M))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K, and N, M, K, L >= 0 and N, M, K, L are within the range of 1 to 10^18.
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is false and the value -1 has been returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from user input, checks if the conditions M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L are met, and prints 1 if both conditions are true; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but modifies the program's output based on the input integers. After execution, the program's state is determined by the printed value, which is either 1, indicating that the input conditions are satisfied, or -1, indicating that the conditions are not met. The function's operation is based on the constraints of the input integers, but it does not validate these constraints beyond what is specified in the conditional statement. The function's functionality implicitly assumes that the input integers are within the specified ranges (1 <= K <= N, 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K, and N, M, K, L >= 0), but it does not explicitly enforce these constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
