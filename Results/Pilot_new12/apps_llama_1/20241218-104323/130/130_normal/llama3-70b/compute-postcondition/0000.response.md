The code `N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` by taking an input and splitting it into four integers. 

These integers are then assigned to `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, respectively, and are guaranteed to be within the range of integers due to the nature of the input function. 

However, we no longer have the constraint that `1 <= K <= N`, `1 <= M`, `1 <= L`, and `1 <= L <= N - K` after this operation because the new values are determined by the input.

The states of other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers.**
