Postcondition: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is false and the value -1 has been returned.**
