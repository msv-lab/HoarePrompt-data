The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, according to the given constraints, the parameters that should be considered are N, M, K, and L. N, M, K, and L are integers such that 1 <= K <= N and 1 <= M, L, and 1 <= L <= N - K, and N, M, K, L >= 0 and N, M, K, L are within the range of 1 to 10^18.

Since there is no provided information about the output of the function, I will assume a general case.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but its functionality is based on the constraints of N, M, K, and L which are integers within the given constraints, however, no return value is specified.**
