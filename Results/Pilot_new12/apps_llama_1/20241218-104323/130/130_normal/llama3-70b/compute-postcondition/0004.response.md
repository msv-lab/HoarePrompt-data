The code prints the value -1. The variables `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers and the condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is false. This means either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L` (or both). The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are unchanged. 
The value -1 has been returned at the output state.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers, where `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are input integers, the condition `(M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L)` is false, and the value -1 has been returned**
