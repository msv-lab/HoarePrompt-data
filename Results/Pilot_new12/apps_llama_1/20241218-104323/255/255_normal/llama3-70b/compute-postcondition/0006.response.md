Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string with at least two characters, `i` is at least 2, and if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in string `s`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise the state of `ans` remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
