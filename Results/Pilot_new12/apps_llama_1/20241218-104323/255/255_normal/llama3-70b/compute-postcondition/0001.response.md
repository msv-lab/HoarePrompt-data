The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` is unknown, but now it holds the input string. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 500.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string**
