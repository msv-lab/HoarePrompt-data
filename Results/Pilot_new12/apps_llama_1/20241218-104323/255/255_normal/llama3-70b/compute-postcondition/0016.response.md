Functionality: **The function processes two lines of input: an integer n and a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and returns the total number of transitions between different characters in the string s plus one, effectively counting the number of distinct character sequences in s, including handling edge cases where n is 1 (in which case it returns 1) or s is a string of the same character repeated (in which case it also returns 1), and it does not modify the input variables n and s, but instead uses them to compute and print the result, which is based solely on the transitions between characters in s.**
