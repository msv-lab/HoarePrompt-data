Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, initially `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is at least 2 since it has been used as `i` and `i-1` in the condition, the current value of `ans` is still 1. `s` has at least two characters. The character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in string `s`.**
