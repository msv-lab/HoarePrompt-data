The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so the new value of `ans` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `ans` is 2, `i` is at least 2, and `s` has at least two characters where the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `i-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `ans` is 2, `i` is at least 2, `s` has at least two characters, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in string `s`.**
