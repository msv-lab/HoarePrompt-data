The input consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n, where 1 <= n <= 500, representing the length of the string s, and the second line contains the string s, a sequence of n lowercase Latin letters. 
The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500, representing the length of the string `s`. However, the string `s` has not been input yet, so its value is still unknown. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500, `s` is unknown**
