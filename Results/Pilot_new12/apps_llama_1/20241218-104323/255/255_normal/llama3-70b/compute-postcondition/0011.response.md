The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, but the values of `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. `n` is still an integer greater than 4, `s` is still an input string with at least two characters, and `i` is still at least 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `s` is an input string with at least two characters, `i` is at least 4, `ans` is increased by 1**
