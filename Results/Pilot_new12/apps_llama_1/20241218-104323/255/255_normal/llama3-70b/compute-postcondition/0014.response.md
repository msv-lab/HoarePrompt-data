The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans` to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables, it only outputs the current value of `ans`. 

The value of `ans` is 1 plus the number of transitions between different characters in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `s` is an input string.

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the state of the variables after the code is executed remains the same as before. The value of `i` is either `n-1` if the loop executed, or it is not defined. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

The `print(ans)` statement returns the value of `ans` to the console, so `ans` is returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string, `ans` is 1 plus the number of transitions between different characters in the first `n-1` characters of `s` and is returned, `i` is either `n-1` or not defined**
