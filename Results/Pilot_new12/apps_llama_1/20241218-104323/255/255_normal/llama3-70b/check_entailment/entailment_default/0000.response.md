Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code processes a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string s by counting the transitions between different characters in the string s and adding one. This is because deleting a contiguous substring of the same characters counts as one operation, and each transition between different characters indicates the start of a new contiguous substring.

The output hints agree with the code and provide insight into its functionality, including handling edge cases where n is 1 or s is a string of the same character repeated. The code does not modify the input variables n and s, but instead uses them to compute and print the result.

Upon analyzing the code and comparing it with the problem description, it appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string s for every potential case. It handles transitions between different characters, including cases where the same character is repeated, and correctly counts the number of distinct character sequences in s.

Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description, such as input "abaca" and "abcddcba", are correctly handled by the code, producing the expected outputs of 3 and 4, respectively.

Therefore, based on the code, output hints, and problem description, it can be concluded that the code is correct for every potential case.
