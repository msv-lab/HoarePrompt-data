You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$ by deleting contiguous substrings of equal letters. 

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of transitions between different letters. Each transition represents a new contiguous substring that needs to be deleted. The program starts with `ans = 1` because the first letter or the first contiguous substring of equal letters is counted as the first operation.

For example, given the string "abaca", the program works as follows:
- It starts with `ans = 1` for the first contiguous substring "a".
- When it encounters "b", it increments `ans` to 2 because "b" is different from "a" and represents a new contiguous substring.
- When it encounters "a" again, it increments `ans` to 3 because this "a" is different from the preceding "b" and represents a new contiguous substring.
- When it encounters "c" and then "a" again, it increments `ans` to 3 and then to 4 for the same reason.
However, upon closer inspection, this example illustrates the process but the actual count for "abaca" would be as follows:
- "a" (1 operation),
- "b" (1 operation),
- "a" (1 operation),
- "c" (1 operation),
- "a" (1 operation).

Given this, the provided code seems to accurately implement the logic to count these operations based on transitions between different letters, which aligns with the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string under the given conditions.

Thus, after analyzing the code and its operation, it seems to correctly follow the problem description and handle all potential cases as described. If there were cases where the program failed to accurately count the minimum number of operations based on the given rules, those would need to be identified to declare the program incorrect. However, based on the provided explanation and the logic implemented, the program appears to work as expected for the described scenario.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two lines of input: an integer n and a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and returns the total number of transitions between different characters in the string s plus one, effectively counting the number of distinct character sequences in s, including handling edge cases where n is 1 (in which case it returns 1) or s is a string of the same character repeated (in which case it also returns 1), and it does not modify the input variables n and s, but instead uses them to compute and print the result, which is based solely on the transitions between characters in s.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
