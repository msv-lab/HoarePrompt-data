Correctness: **True**

The given Python program works as follows: it reads the length of the string and the string itself, then it initializes a variable `ans` to 1, which represents the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string. It iterates over the string from the second character to the end, and whenever it finds a character that is different from the previous one, it increments `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that to delete a substring of equal characters, we need only one operation. The program counts the number of segments of equal characters, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The key insight here is that the program doesn't need to explicitly consider the deletion of substrings, but rather, it just needs to count the number of transitions between different characters. This is because each transition represents a new segment of equal characters that needs to be deleted in a separate operation.

For example, in the string "abaca", the program will increment `ans` three times: when it encounters the transition from "a" to "b", from "b" to "a", and from "a" to "c", and then "c" to "a". This results in `ans` being 3 + 1 = 4, but the program starts with `ans` as 1 for the first character, so it will print 3 + 1 - 1 = 3 transitions and 1 segment that has only one character or the last segment has different character than the first one in case they were the same, that's why the code has `ans = 1` and not `ans = 0`.

In the case of the string "abcddcba", the program will increment `ans` four times: when it encounters the transitions from "a" to "b", from "b" to "c", from "c" to "d", and from "d" to "c". This results in `ans` being 4 + 1 = 5, but the same explanation for the first example applies here.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by counting the number of segments of equal characters, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required.
