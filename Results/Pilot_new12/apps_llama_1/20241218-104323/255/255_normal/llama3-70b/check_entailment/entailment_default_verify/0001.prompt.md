You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program works as follows: it reads the length of the string and the string itself, then it initializes a variable `ans` to 1, which represents the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string. It iterates over the string from the second character to the end, and whenever it finds a character that is different from the previous one, it increments `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that to delete a substring of equal characters, we need only one operation. The program counts the number of segments of equal characters, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The key insight here is that the program doesn't need to explicitly consider the deletion of substrings, but rather, it just needs to count the number of transitions between different characters. This is because each transition represents a new segment of equal characters that needs to be deleted in a separate operation.

For example, in the string "abaca", the program will increment `ans` three times: when it encounters the transition from "a" to "b", from "b" to "a", and from "a" to "c", and then "c" to "a". This results in `ans` being 3 + 1 = 4, but the program starts with `ans` as 1 for the first character, so it will print 3 + 1 - 1 = 3 transitions and 1 segment that has only one character or the last segment has different character than the first one in case they were the same, that's why the code has `ans = 1` and not `ans = 0`.

In the case of the string "abcddcba", the program will increment `ans` four times: when it encounters the transitions from "a" to "b", from "b" to "c", from "c" to "d", and from "d" to "c". This results in `ans` being 4 + 1 = 5, but the same explanation for the first example applies here.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by counting the number of segments of equal characters, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two lines of input: an integer n and a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and returns the total number of transitions between different characters in the string s plus one, effectively counting the number of distinct character sequences in s, including handling edge cases where n is 1 (in which case it returns 1) or s is a string of the same character repeated (in which case it also returns 1), and it does not modify the input variables n and s, but instead uses them to compute and print the result, which is based solely on the transitions between characters in s.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
