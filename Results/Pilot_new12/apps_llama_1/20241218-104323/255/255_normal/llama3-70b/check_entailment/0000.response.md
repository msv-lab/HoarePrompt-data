Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$ by deleting contiguous substrings of equal letters. 

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of transitions between different letters. Each transition represents a new contiguous substring that needs to be deleted. The program starts with `ans = 1` because the first letter or the first contiguous substring of equal letters is counted as the first operation.

For example, given the string "abaca", the program works as follows:
- It starts with `ans = 1` for the first contiguous substring "a".
- When it encounters "b", it increments `ans` to 2 because "b" is different from "a" and represents a new contiguous substring.
- When it encounters "a" again, it increments `ans` to 3 because this "a" is different from the preceding "b" and represents a new contiguous substring.
- When it encounters "c" and then "a" again, it increments `ans` to 3 and then to 4 for the same reason.
However, upon closer inspection, this example illustrates the process but the actual count for "abaca" would be as follows:
- "a" (1 operation),
- "b" (1 operation),
- "a" (1 operation),
- "c" (1 operation),
- "a" (1 operation).

Given this, the provided code seems to accurately implement the logic to count these operations based on transitions between different letters, which aligns with the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string under the given conditions.

Thus, after analyzing the code and its operation, it seems to correctly follow the problem description and handle all potential cases as described. If there were cases where the program failed to accurately count the minimum number of operations based on the given rules, those would need to be identified to declare the program incorrect. However, based on the provided explanation and the logic implemented, the program appears to work as expected for the described scenario.
