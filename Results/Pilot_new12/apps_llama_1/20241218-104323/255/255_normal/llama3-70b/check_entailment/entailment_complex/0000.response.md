Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string `s`, where an operation involves deleting some contiguous substring of `s` if all letters in the substring are equal.

2. **Program Logic**: The program starts with an answer (`ans`) of 1 and increments this counter every time it encounters a change in the character sequence while iterating through the string `s`. This effectively counts the number of distinct character sequences in `s`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `n` is 1, the program still correctly returns 1, because there's only one operation needed to delete a single character (or a string of the same character repeated any number of times).
   - If `s` is a string of the same character repeated, `ans` remains 1 after the loop, as expected, because only one operation is needed to delete the entire string.

4. **Counting Transitions**: The program counts the transitions between different characters by checking if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`. This is a direct implementation of the problem's requirement, as each transition signifies a new sequence of the same character that could be deleted in one operation.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Given the problem statement assumes valid input (i.e., an integer `n` between 1 and 500, followed by a string `s` of `n` lowercase Latin letters), the program does not need to handle invalid input cases.

Therefore, the program accurately implements the solution to the problem described, counting the minimum number of operations required to delete the string `s` by identifying and counting distinct sequences of characters that can be deleted in a single operation.
