Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I will evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires calculating the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$ by deleting contiguous substrings of equal characters.

The provided code seems to implement a reasonable approach by counting the number of transitions between different characters in the string. The original assessment explains the reasoning behind this approach and why it should work correctly.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the program initializes `ans` to 1 and increments it each time it encounters a transition between different characters.

After carefully examining the code and the annotations, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by counting the number of segments of equal characters, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required.

The key insight is that each transition between different characters represents a new segment of equal characters that needs to be deleted in a separate operation. By starting with `ans = 1` and incrementing it for each transition, the program correctly accounts for the minimum number of operations required.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
