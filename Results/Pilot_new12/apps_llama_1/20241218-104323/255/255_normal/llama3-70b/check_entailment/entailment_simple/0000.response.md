Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by removing contiguous substrings of equal letters.

Here's why it works:

1. The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which represents the minimum number of operations when the entire string consists of the same letter.

2. The program then iterates over the string `s` from the second character to the end. For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous one.

3. If the current character is different from the previous one, it increments `ans` by 1. This represents a new operation required to remove the contiguous substring of the previous character.

4. After iterating over the entire string, `ans` will hold the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

This approach works because it effectively splits the string into contiguous substrings of equal letters and counts the number of such substrings. Since each substring requires a separate operation to remove, the count of substrings equals the minimum number of operations.

For example, given the input string "abaca", the program will count 3 operations: one to remove the "a", one to remove the "b", and one to remove the "aca" (which consists of two different characters but is still a single operation because it's contiguous).

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string.
