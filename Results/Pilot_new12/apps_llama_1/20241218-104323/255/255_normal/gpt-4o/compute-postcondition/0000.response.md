The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user. The previous value of `n` and the string `s` are not affected by this operation, except that the new value of `n` may or may not satisfy the original constraint of being between 1 and 500. 

The string `s` is of length `n`, but since `n` is updated, the length of `s` is now equal to the new value of `n` input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters**
