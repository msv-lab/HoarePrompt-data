The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. The initial value of `operations` is 2. 

The new value of `operations` is 2 + 1, which equals 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `operations` is 3, `i` is 2**
