Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` in string `s`, then `operations` is 2 and `i` is 1, otherwise the state of `operations` and `i` remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle the opposite condition.**
