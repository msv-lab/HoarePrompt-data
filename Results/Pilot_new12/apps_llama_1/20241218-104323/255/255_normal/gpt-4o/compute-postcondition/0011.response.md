The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `operations` can be either unchanged or 3, and `i` can be either unchanged or 3, depending on whether `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`. Since `operations` is incremented by 1, the new value of `operations` will be either 3 + 1 = 4, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, or the previous value of `operations` plus 1, if `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `s`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, then `operations` is 4 and `i` is 3, otherwise `operations` is the previous value of `operations` plus 1 and `i` remains unchanged**
