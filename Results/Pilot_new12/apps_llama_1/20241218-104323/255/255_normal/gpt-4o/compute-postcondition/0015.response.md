The function does not have any parameters defined in the provided code. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Since the output is not provided, I will assume that the function's return value is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and s, where n is an integer between 1 and 500, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, but the return value is not specified.**
