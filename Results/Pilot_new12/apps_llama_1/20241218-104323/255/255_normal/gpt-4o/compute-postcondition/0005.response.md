The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `operations` was 1, so the new value of `operations` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` in string `s`.**
