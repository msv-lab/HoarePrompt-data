According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`, then `operations` is 3 and `i` is 3, otherwise the state of `operations` and `i` remains unchanged**
