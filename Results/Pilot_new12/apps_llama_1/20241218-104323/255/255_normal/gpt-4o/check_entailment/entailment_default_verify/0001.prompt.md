You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string by counting the number of sequences of different characters.

The program works as follows: it starts with a number of operations equal to 1, assuming that the first character will be deleted in the first operation. Then it iterates over the string, incrementing the number of operations whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. This correctly counts the number of distinct sequences of characters that need to be deleted.

For example, given the input string "abaca", the program will count 3 operations: one for the sequence "a", one for the sequence "b", and one for the sequences "a" and "c" and "a". However, this will be counted as 3 because "a" is different from "b" and "c" so the operations will be "a" then "b" then "aca". But "a" is the same as in "aca" so this will be 3 operations: "a", "b", "aca". Then "a" in "aca" will be deleted in the operation that deletes "aca". So "a" is counted twice but it will be deleted in 3 operations.

The code will work correctly for all possible inputs because it correctly counts the number of distinct sequences of characters. Since the problem requires deleting all characters, and each operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal characters, the minimum number of operations is indeed the number of distinct sequences of characters.

The provided examples in the problem description also support the correctness of the program. For instance, the input "abaca" requires 3 operations, and the input "abcddcba" requires 4 operations, which is correctly calculated by the program.

In general, the program will work correctly for any input string because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all possible cases, including strings with repeated characters, strings with distinct characters, and strings of varying lengths. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters from the user, counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string (i.e., the number of pairs of adjacent characters that are not equal) plus one, and prints this count as its output, effectively measuring the minimum number of distinct characters needed to represent the string by considering each transition as a new distinct character. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 1 to 500 or where `s` contains non-lowercase Latin letters, despite the annotations suggesting such constraints. After the function concludes, the program's state is that it has printed the count of operations (transitions plus one) to the console, without modifying the input string or integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
