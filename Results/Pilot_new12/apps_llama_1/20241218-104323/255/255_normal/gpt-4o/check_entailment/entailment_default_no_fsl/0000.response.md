Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$. The provided code iterates over the string $s$ and increments the operation count whenever it encounters a transition between different characters. This approach aligns with the problem description, which defines an operation as deleting a contiguous substring of equal characters.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, given the input "abaca", the program correctly outputs 3, as the minimum number of operations to delete the string would involve deleting the substrings "a", "b", and "aca" separately. Similarly, for the input "abcddcba", the program outputs 4, which corresponds to deleting the substrings "a", "bcd", "d", and "cba" separately.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, and the provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness. Since the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a string of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters), the program's correctness is not affected by potential edge cases such as invalid input.
