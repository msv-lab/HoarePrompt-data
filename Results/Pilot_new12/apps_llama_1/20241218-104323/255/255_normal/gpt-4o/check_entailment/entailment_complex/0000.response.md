Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string `s`. The problem description states that in one operation, a contiguous substring with equal letters can be deleted. The program counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string, which effectively measures the minimum number of distinct character sequences (each of which can be deleted in one operation) in the string.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It iterates over the string `s` from the second character to the last character.
2. For each character, it checks if it is different from the previous character. If they are different, it increments the `operations` counter by 1.
3. This process effectively counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string.
4. The `operations` counter is initialized to 1, which means that even if the string consists of a single character sequence, it still requires 1 operation to delete.
5. The program prints the final value of `operations`, which represents the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string `s`.

The program's logic is sound because it correctly identifies the minimum number of distinct character sequences in the string, each of which can be deleted in one operation. The problem description examples also validate the program's correctness:

* For the input `abaca`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct because the string can be deleted in 3 operations: `a`, `baca`, and then `ca`.
* For the input `abcddcba`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct because the string can be deleted in 4 operations: `a`, `bcd`, `d`, and then `cba`.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string `s`, as specified in the problem description.
