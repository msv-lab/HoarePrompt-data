Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$, where an operation is defined as deleting some contiguous substring of $s$ if all letters in the substring are equal.

Here's why the program works:

- The program initializes `operations` to 1, which accounts for the minimum of one operation needed to delete a string of any length (even if all characters are the same, this operation would delete the entire string).

- It then iterates through the string $s$, comparing each character with its predecessor. Whenever it finds a pair of characters that are not equal (`s[i]!= s[i - 1]`), it increments `operations` by 1.

- The reason this works is that for any string $s$, the minimum number of operations required to delete it is equivalent to the number of distinct "runs" of characters. A run is a sequence of the same character. For example, in the string "aaabbbcccc", there are 3 distinct runs ("aaa", "bbb", "cccc"), and thus the minimum number of operations to delete this string would be 3.

- By incrementing `operations` every time a different character is encountered, the program effectively counts the number of these runs.

- Finally, the program prints `operations`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string $s$ according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says for every potential case, making it correct.
