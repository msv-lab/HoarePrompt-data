Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to 1, otherwise nothing changes, and `t` remains 1, with `current_cost` being the cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`.***
