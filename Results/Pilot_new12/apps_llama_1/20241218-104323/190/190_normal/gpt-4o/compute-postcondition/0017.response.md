Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 2`.***
