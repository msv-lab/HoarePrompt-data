The code changes the value of `best_t` to be equal to `t`. Given the initial state, `t` is 3, so `best_t` is updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`**
