The code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` increases the value of `current_cost` by the difference between `t - 1` and `length`. Given that `t` is 3 and `length` is less than 2, `t - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `current_cost` is increased by `2 - length`. 

Since `length` is the first element in the list `a` and is less than 2, `length` can be either 1 or 0 (considering it must be an integer as it's part of the list of input integers and the first element of `a`).

If `length` is 1, then `current_cost` is increased by `2 - 1 = 1`.
If `length` is 0, then `current_cost` is increased by `2 - 0 = 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is either increased by 1 if `length` is 1 or by 2 if `length` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, `length` is less than 2, and `current_cost` is either `current_cost + 1` if `length` is 1 or `current_cost + 2` if `length` is 0**
