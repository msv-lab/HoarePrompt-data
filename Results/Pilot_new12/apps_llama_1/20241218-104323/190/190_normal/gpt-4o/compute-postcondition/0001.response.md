The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the results in a list `a`. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but this code does not directly affect the value of `n`. 

The output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers**
