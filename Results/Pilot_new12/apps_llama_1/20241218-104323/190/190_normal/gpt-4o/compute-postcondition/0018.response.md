Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is less than 0 since `t` is 1), then `current_cost` is decreased by `a[1]`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (which is 0 since `t` is 1) and `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 2 since `t` is 1), then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 2`. If `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1` (inclusive), no change is made to `current_cost`.***
