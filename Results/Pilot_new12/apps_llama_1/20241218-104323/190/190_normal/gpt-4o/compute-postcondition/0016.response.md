The given code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` impacts the program by updating the `current_cost` variable. Since `length` is the second element in the list `a` and `t` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation.

`current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)`, which simplifies to `length - 2` because `t` is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - 2`.
