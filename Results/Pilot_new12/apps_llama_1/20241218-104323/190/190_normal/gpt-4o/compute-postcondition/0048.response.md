Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 more element to iterate over, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 1), then `current_cost` is `initial_value_of_current_cost + 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (which is 1) and less than or equal to `t + 1` (which is 3), then no change is made to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 3), then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.**
