According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` because the loop iterates over a fixed range from 1 to 100. The loop variable `t` will take on values from 1 to 100. 

At the start of the loop, `t` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
