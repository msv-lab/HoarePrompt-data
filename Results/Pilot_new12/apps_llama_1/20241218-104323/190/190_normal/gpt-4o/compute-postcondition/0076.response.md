The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`. The previous value of `min_cost` was 0, but it is now equal to the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is equal to the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`, where adjustments are made according to the rules: (2 - length) for length < 2, 0 for 2 ≤ length ≤ 4, and (length - 4) for length > 4.**
