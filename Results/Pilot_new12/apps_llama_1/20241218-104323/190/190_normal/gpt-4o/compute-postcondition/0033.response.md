The value of `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. The value of `t` is 2, so `t - 1` is 1. The initial value of `length` is the first element in the list `a`, but the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`, which is 1. Therefore, `length` is 0. 

`current_cost` becomes `current_cost + (1 - length)`, which is `current_cost + (1 - 0)`, so `current_cost` is increased by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, the initial value of `length` is the first element in the list `a`, the current value of `length` is 0, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is 1, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, the initial value of `length` is the first element in the list `a`, the current value of `length` is 0, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is 1, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is 1**
