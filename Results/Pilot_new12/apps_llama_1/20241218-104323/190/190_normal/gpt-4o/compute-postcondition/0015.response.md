The value of `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. The initial value of `current_cost` is not specified, but we know that `t` is 1 and `length` is the second element in the list `a`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is increased by `1 - 1 - length` which equals `current_cost` - `length`.

Since `length` equals the second element in `a`, then `current_cost` equals `current_cost` - `a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost` - `a[1]`**
