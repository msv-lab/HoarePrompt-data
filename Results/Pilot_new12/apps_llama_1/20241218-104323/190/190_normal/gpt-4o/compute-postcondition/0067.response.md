Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and if `length` is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., greater than 4), then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged***
