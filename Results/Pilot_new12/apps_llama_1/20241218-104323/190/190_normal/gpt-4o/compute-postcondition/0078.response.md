Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`, otherwise, `min_cost` remains 0, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for each length in `a`, where adjustments are made according to the rules: (2 - length) for length < 2, 0 for 2 ≤ length ≤ 4, and (length - 4) for length > 4.**
