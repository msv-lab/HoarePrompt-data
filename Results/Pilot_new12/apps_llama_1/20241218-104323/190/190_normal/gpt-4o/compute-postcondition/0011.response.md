To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element, where the first element is considered as `length` and is greater than or equal to `t - 1`.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 1.
- `current_cost` is 0.
- The current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`.

The given code is:
```python
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```
Given that `t` is 1, the expression `t + 1` equals 2. Since `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 2), `length` is at least 3 or more. 

The value of `current_cost` is incremented by `length - 2`. Since `length` is at least 3, `length - 2` is at least 1, making `current_cost` at least 1 after the execution.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `length`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), 
`a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, 
the first element in the list `a` is considered as `length` and it is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, 
`min_cost` is positive infinity, 
`best_t` is -1, 
`t` is 1, 
`length` is greater than `t + 1`, 
`current_cost` is at least 1 and equal to its previous value plus `length - (t + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element in the list `a` is considered as `length` and it is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is at least 1 and equal to its previous value plus `length - (t + 1)`**
