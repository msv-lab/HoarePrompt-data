The given code is `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`. To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the effect of the code on it.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
- `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements
- `t` is 2
- `best_t` is 1

Since `t` is 2, we substitute `t` in the equation `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` to get `current_cost += length - (2 + 1)` which simplifies to `current_cost += length - 3`.

However, we do not have specific values for `length` and `current_cost` in the initial state. Thus, we cannot calculate a specific value for `current_cost` after the execution of the code. We can only express the change in `current_cost` as an increase by `length - 3`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `t`, and `best_t` are not affected by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.**
