The code updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to the current value of `current_cost`. The previous value of `min_cost` was positive infinity, but since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, this update reduces the value of `min_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`.**
