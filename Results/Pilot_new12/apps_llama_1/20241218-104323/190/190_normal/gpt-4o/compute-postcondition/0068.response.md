Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (i.e., less than 2), then `current_cost` is its previous value plus `2 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (i.e., greater than or equal to 2) and less than or equal to `t + 1` (i.e., less than or equal to 4), then the state remains unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., greater than 4), then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4`.***
