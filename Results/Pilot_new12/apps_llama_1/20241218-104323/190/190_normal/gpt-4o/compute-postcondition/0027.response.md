The code assigns the value of `t` to `best_t`. Given that `t` is 1, `best_t` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`**
