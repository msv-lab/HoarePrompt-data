Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `length` is less than 0 and `current_cost` is `0 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, then `length` is greater than or equal to 0. Furthermore, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is at least 1 and equal to its previous value plus `length - (t + 1)`. If `length` is not greater than `t + 1`, then the state of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
