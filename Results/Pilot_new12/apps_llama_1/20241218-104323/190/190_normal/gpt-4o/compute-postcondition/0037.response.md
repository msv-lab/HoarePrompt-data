Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1. If the length of `a` (which is the first element of `a`) is greater than 3, then `current_cost` is `length - 3` and `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far. If the length of `a` is between 1 and 3 (inclusive), then the state of `current_cost` and `min_cost` remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
