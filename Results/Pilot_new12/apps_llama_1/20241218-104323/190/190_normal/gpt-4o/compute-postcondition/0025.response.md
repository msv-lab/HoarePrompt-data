Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, initially `min_cost` was positive infinity and `best_t` was -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`. The current value of `current_cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
