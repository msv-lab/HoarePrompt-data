Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, the initial value of `length` is the first element in the list `a`, the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` where `t` is 2, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is 1**
