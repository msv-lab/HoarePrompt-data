The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding the difference between the `length` and `(t + 1)` to it. Given that `t` is 3, `(t + 1)` equals 4. The `length` is more than 4. 

Therefore, `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + length - 4`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

So, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`, the length is the first element in the list `a`, the length is more than or equal to 2, and the current value of the length is more than 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`, the length is the first element in the list `a`, the length is more than or equal to 2, and the current value of the length is more than 4.**
