Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 2, if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `best_t` is 2 and `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, which is the initial value (0) plus the sum of adjustments made based on the lengths in `a`: for each length less than 1, add `1 - length`, and for each length greater than 3, add `length - 3`, and `current_cost` is less than or equal to `min_cost`. If `current_cost` is not less than `min_cost`, then the values of `n`, `a`, `t`, `best_t`, and `current_cost` remain unchanged, with `current_cost` still being the initial value (0) plus the sum of adjustments made based on the lengths in `a`.***
