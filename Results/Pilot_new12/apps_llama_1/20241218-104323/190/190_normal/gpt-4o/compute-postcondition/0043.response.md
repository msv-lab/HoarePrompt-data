Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `length`: if `length` is less than `t - 1` (i.e., less than 1), `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`; if `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1` (inclusive) (i.e., between 1 and 3), no change is made to `current_cost` based on the provided conditions; if `length` is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., greater than 3), `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`.**
