The given code increments `current_cost` by `length - (t + 1)`. Since `t` is 3, `t + 1` is 4. However, we do not have the specific value of `length` or `current_cost` in the initial state. 

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and assuming `length` and `current_cost` have some values (since they are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values after the operation), we can only express the change in `current_cost` in terms of the given variables and constants.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is increased by `length - 4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`**
