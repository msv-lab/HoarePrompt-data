The code `min_cost = float('inf')` declares a variable `min_cost` and assigns it a value of positive infinity. 

The values of the variables `n` and `a` are not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity**
