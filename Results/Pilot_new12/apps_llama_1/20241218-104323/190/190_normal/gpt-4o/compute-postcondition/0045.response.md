To calculate the result, we need to consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet. 

The initial state provides the following information: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
- `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 more element to iterate over
- `t` is 2
- `best_t` is 1
- The variable `current_cost` and `length` are not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine their exact values before the execution of the code. However, we know that their values will be used in the calculation.

The given code is `current_cost += t - 1 - length`. 

To evaluate this expression, we need to know the values of `current_cost`, `t`, and `length`. 

From the initial state, we know `t` is 2. 

So, `t - 1` equals 1. 

However, the values of `current_cost` and `length` are unknown.

Thus, the expression becomes `current_cost += 1 - length`.

Since we don't know the initial value of `current_cost` and the value of `length`, we can only express the new value of `current_cost` as `current_cost + 1 - length` or `initial_value_of_current_cost + 1 - length`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `t`, `best_t`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 more element to iterate over, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is `initial_value_of_current_cost + 1 - length`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 more element to iterate over, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is `initial_value_of_current_cost + 1 - length`**
