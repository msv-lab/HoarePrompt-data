The code is updating the `current_cost` variable by adding the difference between the `length` and `(t + 1)`. Given that `t` is 3 and we are considering the second element of `a` as the new `length`, let's denote this second element as `a[1]`. 

The value of `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + a[1] - (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `current_cost + a[1] - 4`. 

The other variables `n`, `a`, `t`, `best_t`, and `min_cost` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + a[1] - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + a[1] - 4**
