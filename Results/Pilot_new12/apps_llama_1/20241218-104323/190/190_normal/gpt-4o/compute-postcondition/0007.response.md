Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, `length` is the first element in the list `a`. The current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`, which implies that the current value of `length` is less than 0 since `t` is 1**
