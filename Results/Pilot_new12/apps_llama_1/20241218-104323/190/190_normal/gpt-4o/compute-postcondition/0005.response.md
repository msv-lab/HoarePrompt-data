The code introduces a new variable `current_cost` and assigns it a value of 0. The previous values of the variables `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0**
