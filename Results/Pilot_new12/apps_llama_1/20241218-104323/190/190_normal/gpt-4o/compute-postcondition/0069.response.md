To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop iterates over the list `a` and how the conditions within the loop body affect the variables.

Given that `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements and we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means we have already processed the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next element in the list.

The variables `n`, `t`, `best_t`, and `min_cost` do not directly depend on the loop variable `length` for their updates based on the information provided. The crucial variable here is `length`, which is directly influenced by the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 3, and `best_t` is 3. These values, along with `n` and `min_cost`, remain unchanged as we move to the next iteration because their updates are not specified to depend on the iteration over `a`. The variable `current_cost` is updated based on `length`, but since we are moving to the next iteration, we consider the next `length` value from `a`.

Since `a` has at least 2 elements and we've just finished processing the first element, the next element will be the second element of `a`. The state adjustments primarily concern the position in the list `a` we are currently processing.

Given this, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), as there's no operation specified that changes `n` based on the iteration over `a`.
- `a` remains a list of input integers, but we are now considering its second element.
- `t` and `best_t` remain 3, as their values are not updated based on the iteration over `a`.
- `min_cost` remains 0, as its update conditions are not directly influenced by the loop over `a`.
- The new `length` will be the next integer in the list `a`, implying we have moved to the second element of `a`.

Thus, considering the updates and the fact that we move to the next element in `a` for the next iteration, the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and we are considering the second element of `a` as the new `length`**
