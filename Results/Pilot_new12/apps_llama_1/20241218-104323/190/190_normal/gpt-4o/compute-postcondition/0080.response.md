The code snippet provided is a print statement, which does not modify any variables but rather outputs the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. 

The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that corresponds to the minimum cost, `t` is 100, and the value of `best_t` and `min_cost` has been printed.**
