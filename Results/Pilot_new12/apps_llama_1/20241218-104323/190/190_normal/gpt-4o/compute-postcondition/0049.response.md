To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```
Given that `t` is 2, the conditions can be simplified to:
```python
for length in a:
    if length < 1:
        current_cost += 1 - length
    elif length > 3:
        current_cost += length - 3
```
From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the pattern of how `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `length`.

Now, let's determine the output state after all iterations have finished:

- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` is a list of input integers. After the loop finishes, `a` will still be the same list, but the loop will have iterated over all its elements.
- `t` is 2, and it does not change throughout the loop.
- `best_t` is 1, and its value is not modified within the given loop code.
- `current_cost` is initially 0. After the loop finishes, `current_cost` will have been updated based on the values of `length` in the list `a`. Specifically, for each `length` that is less than 1, `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`, and for each `length` that is greater than 3, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`. If `length` is between 1 and 3 (inclusive), `current_cost` remains unchanged for that iteration.

Considering all possible scenarios for the list `a` (including the case where `a` is empty), we can conclude the following:

- If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `current_cost` will remain 0.
- If `a` contains elements, `current_cost` will be updated according to the rules specified in the loop code.

However, the exact final value of `current_cost` depends on the specific elements in the list `a`. We can generalize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the initial value (0) plus the sum of adjustments made based on the lengths in `a`: for each length less than 1, add `1 - length`, and for each length greater than 3, add `length - 3`.**
