The code sets `best_t` to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` remains a list of input integers, and `min_cost` remains positive infinity.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1**
