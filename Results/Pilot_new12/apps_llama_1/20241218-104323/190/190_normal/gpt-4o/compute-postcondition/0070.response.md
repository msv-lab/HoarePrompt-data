To solve this problem, we'll follow the given format and analyze the impact of the code on the program state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
- `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements
- `t` is 3
- `best_t` is 3
- `min_cost` is 0
- We are considering the second element of `a` as the new `length`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Given that `t` is 3 and we are considering the second element of `a` as the new `length`, let's denote this second element as `a[1]`. The equation then becomes:
```python
current_cost += 3 - 1 - a[1]
```
Simplifying, we get:
```python
current_cost += 2 - a[1]
```

So, `current_cost` is incremented by `2 - a[1]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `t`, `best_t`, `min_cost`) are not affected by this operation. The only change is in `current_cost`, which is now `current_cost + (2 - a[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + (2 - a[1])`.**
