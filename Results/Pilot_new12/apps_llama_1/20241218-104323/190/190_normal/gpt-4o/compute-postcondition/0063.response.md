Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0. If the length (the first element in the list `a`) is less than 2, then `current_cost` is either `current_cost + 1` if `length` is 1 or `current_cost + 2` if `length` is 0. Otherwise, if the length is more than or equal to 2, then if the length is more than 4, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`, otherwise `current_cost` remains 0.***
