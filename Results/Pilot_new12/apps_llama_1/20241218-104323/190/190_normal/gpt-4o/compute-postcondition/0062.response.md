Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `best_t` is 3, `min_cost` is 0, the length is the first element in the list `a`, the length is more than or equal to 2. If the length is more than 4, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`. Otherwise, `current_cost` remains 0.***
