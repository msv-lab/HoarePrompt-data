Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1. If the length of `a` (which is the first element of `a`) is less than 1, then the current value of `length` is 0, `current_cost` is 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, then `current_cost` is `length - 3` if `length` is greater than 3, otherwise `current_cost` remains unchanged, and `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, with `length` being the first element in the list `a`.***
