Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, `length` is the third element in the list `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (i.e., less than 1), then `current_cost` is its initial value plus `1 - a[2]`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (i.e., greater than or equal to 1), then if `length` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is increased by `a[2] - 3`.***
