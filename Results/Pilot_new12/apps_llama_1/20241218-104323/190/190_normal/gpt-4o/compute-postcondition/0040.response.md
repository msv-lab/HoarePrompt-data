To calculate the result of the code `current_cost += t - 1 - length`, we first need to understand the initial state and the given variables.

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements.
- `t` is 2.
- `best_t` is 1.

Given that `t` equals 2 and assuming that `length` is defined somewhere in the code (though its initial value is not provided in the problem statement), we can calculate the change in `current_cost`.

The expression `t - 1 - length` evaluates to `2 - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `1 - length`. This value is then added to `current_cost`.

Since the exact value of `length` and the initial value of `current_cost` are not provided, the change in `current_cost` is dependent on these unknowns. However, we can express the new value of `current_cost` as `current_cost + (1 - length)`.

Given that we do not know the initial value of `current_cost` or `length`, and the values of `n`, `a`, `t`, and `best_t` are not changed by the given code snippet, the output state reflects the change in `current_cost` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`**
