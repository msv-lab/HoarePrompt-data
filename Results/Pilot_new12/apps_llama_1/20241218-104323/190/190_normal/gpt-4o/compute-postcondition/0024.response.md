To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 1.
- `current_cost` is 0.

From the loop code, we can see that `current_cost` is updated based on the comparison between `length` and `t`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`. If `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1` (inclusive), `current_cost` remains unchanged.

The output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times provide insights into how `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `length` relative to `t`. However, to determine the final output state after all iterations, we need to consider the loop's behavior for any list `a` and the given constraints.

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` is a list of input integers, and its length determines how many times the loop iterates.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` are not updated within the given loop code, so their values remain unchanged.
- `t` starts at 1, but there's no information provided in the loop code about how `t` changes. Given the initial value and the lack of update logic within the loop, `t` remains 1 throughout the loop's execution.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the comparisons with `t`. Its final value depends on the elements of `a` and their relation to `t`.

Considering the loop's logic and the initial state:
- If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values.
- If `a` is not empty, the loop executes, updating `current_cost` based on the elements of `a`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 1.
- `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments made based on the elements of `a` relative to `t`. For each `length` in `a`, if `length < t - 1`, it contributes `t - 1 - length` to `current_cost`; if `length > t + 1`, it contributes `length - (t + 1)` to `current_cost`. Otherwise, it does not change `current_cost`.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the specifics of the list `a` and the fixed value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is the cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`.**
