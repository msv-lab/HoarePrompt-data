Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `t` is 2, `best_t` is 1, and the current value of `current_cost` is the initial value (0) plus the sum of adjustments made based on the lengths in `a`: for each length less than 1, add `1 - length`, and for each length greater than 3, add `length - 3`, and the current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`**
