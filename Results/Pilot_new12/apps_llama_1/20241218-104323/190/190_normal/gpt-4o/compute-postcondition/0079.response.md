To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and for each iteration, it calculates the `current_cost` based on the differences between the elements of list `a` and the current value of `t`. If the `current_cost` is less than the `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` and sets `best_t` to the current value of `t`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following variables will have the following values:
- `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), as it is not modified in the loop.
- `a` will still be the list of input integers, as it is not modified in the loop.
- `min_cost` will be the minimum cost found among all iterations, which is the minimum cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`.
- `best_t` will be the value of `t` that corresponds to the minimum cost found, which is the value of `t` that results in the minimum cumulative adjustment.
- `t` will be 100, as it is the last value in the range.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible in this case since the loop iterates over a fixed range), the values of the variables would be:
- `n` would still be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` would still be the list of input integers.
- `min_cost` would still be positive infinity.
- `best_t` would still be -1.

However, since the loop will always execute, we can conclude that:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that corresponds to the minimum cost, and `t` is 100.**
