Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem described. It iterates through all possible values of `t` (from 1 to 100), calculates the cost of adjusting the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for each `t`, and keeps track of the `t` that results in the minimum cost.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. For each `t`, it correctly calculates the cost by summing the adjustments needed for each stick to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. If a stick's length is less than `t-1`, it increases the stick's length to `t-1`, and if a stick's length is greater than `t+1`, it decreases the stick's length to `t+1`.

The program also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, given the input `3` and `10 1 4`, the program outputs `3 7`, which is the correct result. Similarly, given the input `5` and `1 1 2 2 3`, the program outputs `2 0`, which is also correct.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer input or out-of-range integers). Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
