You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
    print(best_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100, calculates the cost of changing the lengths of all sticks to be almost good for `t`, and keeps track of the `t` value that results in the minimum cost.

The logic for calculating the cost is correct. For each stick, if its length is less than `t - 1`, it needs to be increased to `t - 1` to be almost good for `t`, so the cost is `t - 1 - length`. If its length is greater than `t + 1`, it needs to be decreased to `t + 1` to be almost good for `t`, so the cost is `length - (t + 1)`. If its length is already almost good for `t`, the cost is 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple optimal choices for `t`, as it will print any of them.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func takes no arguments, but the program reads two lines of input where the first line is a single integer n (1 <= n <= 1000) and the second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of input integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative adjustment based on the differences between elements of `a` and the value of `t`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that corresponds to the minimum cost, and `t` is 100.
    print(best_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lines of input through the program's standard input, with the first line containing a single integer n (1 <= n <= 1000) and the second line containing n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100). It calculates and prints the value of t (between 1 and 100 inclusive) that minimizes the cumulative adjustment cost, based on the differences between each integer in the input list and the value of t, and the corresponding minimum cost. The cost is calculated as the sum of adjustments needed for each integer to be within the range [t-1, t+1], where integers less than t-1 are increased to t-1 and integers greater than t+1 are decreased to t+1. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer input or out-of-range integers), and it does not provide any error messages or handling for such cases. After execution, the function's state is reflected in its output, which is the value of t that corresponds to the minimum cost and the minimum cost itself, printed to the standard output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
