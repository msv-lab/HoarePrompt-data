Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100, calculates the cost of changing the lengths of all sticks to be almost good for `t`, and keeps track of the `t` value that results in the minimum cost.

The logic for calculating the cost is correct. For each stick, if its length is less than `t - 1`, it needs to be increased to `t - 1` to be almost good for `t`, so the cost is `t - 1 - length`. If its length is greater than `t + 1`, it needs to be decreased to `t + 1` to be almost good for `t`, so the cost is `length - (t + 1)`. If its length is already almost good for `t`, the cost is 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple optimal choices for `t`, as it will print any of them.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
