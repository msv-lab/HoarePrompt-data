Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. For every potential stick length, it calculates the cost of adjusting it to be almost good for a given value of `t`. It then checks all possible values of `t` (from 1 to 100) and keeps track of the value of `t` that results in the minimum total cost. 

The code handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, when the inputs are `3` and `[10, 1, 4]`, it correctly outputs `3 7`, which is the minimum cost of adjusting the sticks to be almost good for `t = 3`. 

The output hints also agree with the code and help confirm that the code indeed follows the problem description. The function calculates and prints the value of `t` that minimizes the cumulative adjustment cost and the corresponding minimum cost, which is in line with the problem description.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `a_i` will be positive integers between 1 and 100), the code is correct for every potential case. It does not contain any logic errors or handle invalid cases (which we assume will not occur). Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem description, and its output matches the expected output for all valid inputs.
