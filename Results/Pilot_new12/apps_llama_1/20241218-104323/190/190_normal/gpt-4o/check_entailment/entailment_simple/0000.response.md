Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. It reads the input correctly: The program reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `a_i` as specified in the problem description.

2. It iterates over all possible values of `t`: The program tries all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100, which covers all possible lengths of the sticks.

3. It calculates the cost for each `t`: For each `t`, the program calculates the cost of changing the lengths of the sticks so that they are all almost good for `t`. It does this by checking each stick's length and adding the difference to the cost if the stick's length is not almost good for `t`.

4. It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`: The program keeps track of the minimum cost it has found so far and the corresponding value of `t`. If it finds a `t` with a lower cost, it updates the minimum cost and the corresponding `t`.

5. It prints the result: Finally, the program prints the value of `t` that corresponds to the minimum cost and the minimum cost itself.

The program handles all possible cases because it tries all possible values of `t` and calculates the cost for each one. It does not assume anything about the input that is not specified in the problem description, and it does not have any obvious errors. 

One potential issue could be that the program assumes that the sticks' lengths are integers between 1 and 100, but this is actually specified in the problem description, so it is a valid assumption. 

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, so it is correct.
