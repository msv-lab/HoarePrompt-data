The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and calculates the minimum sum of the minimum distances between each element in the list and two consecutive points in the range from the median value to 1 and 100, then returns the point that achieves this minimum sum and the minimum sum itself. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list (although this is not explicitly tested in the provided code), and missing logic such as considering all possible points between 1 and 100 as the target value, not just the ones around the median. Note that the function's annotation claims it returns the maximum value in the list, but the actual code calculates and returns the point that minimizes the sum of minimum distances, making the annotation incorrect. The function's return values are the point `min_t` that achieves the minimum sum and the minimum sum `min_cost` itself.
