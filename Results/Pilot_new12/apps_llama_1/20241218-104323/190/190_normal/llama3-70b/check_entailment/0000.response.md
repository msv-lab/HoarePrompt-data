Correctness: **False**

The program is trying to find the optimal value of `t` such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for `t` with the minimum cost of changing. However, the current implementation is not considering the correct range for the optimal `t` value. The program is starting from `mid - 1` and going down to `1`, and then from `mid + 1` up to `101`. But the problem statement does not guarantee that the optimal `t` value will be within the range of the given stick lengths.

For example, if the input is `3 4 5`, the program will start checking from `4 - 1 = 3`, but it will not consider the case where `t = 4 - 2 = 2` or `t = 5 + 1 = 6`, which might be the optimal solution.

The correct approach should be to try all possible `t` values and calculate the minimum cost. However, the current program is not doing this.

A potential counterexample is the case where the input is `5 1 1 1 1 100`, where the program will incorrectly conclude that the optimal `t` value is one of the given stick lengths, instead of considering the possibility that the optimal `t` value is somewhere in between, such as `t = 2`. 

This input shows that the current program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, therefore the program is incorrect.
