You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost and finds the optimal value of `t`. The program starts with the middle stick length as the initial `t` and then checks all possible values of `t` in the range `[0, 100]`. However, it does not consider the case where the optimal `t` is the average of two stick lengths.

A counterexample is when the input is `2` and `51 52`. In this case, the optimal `t` is `51` or `52`, but the program may choose `51` or `52` but the minimum cost should be 0 when `t` equals to either `51` or `52`. However, when the input is `2` and `50 53`, the optimal `t` is `51` and the minimum cost should be `3`. But the current program will choose `50` or `53` and will calculate the minimum cost as `3` for `t=51`. So, the current program will fail when `t` equals to `51` for input `2` and `50 53`.

Here is a counterexample for more detailed analysis.

Input:
3
50 52 53

Expected Output:
52 1

However, the program will output:
52 1

However, for the input:
3
1 2 100

The program will output:
2 98

And for this:
3
49 51 52

The program will output:
51 2 

But this seems correct. So, this example does not demonstrate a mistake, it just shows that the code could be working, it's correct but for all cases? We need to test it against more cases.
Since, at first glance this simple counterexample did not demonstrate the error we must now carefully analyze all the potential cases to find when the code might not work. After testing multiple examples, including edge cases and examples with different numbers of sticks, it appears that the program does not cover the optimal solution for all cases but there is an issue. 

One example is:
Input:
4
49 50 51 52

The program seems to work correctly for this input. 
Another example:
Input:
2
1 100

The output of the program is 1 99 which is correct because to minimize cost we can make both sticks of length 1 or 100 but we must choose the `t` which will be either `1` or `99`. 

It turns out that this specific example does work as expected but as mentioned earlier for inputs like:
3
50 52 53 
or 
3
1 2 100
the code works fine but what about:
Input:
1000
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3

Here the code will work correctly.
So after testing all examples we see that there are cases that the code might seem fine for, but we still need to be careful. And then we see the code's explanation. The issue seems to be in this line `cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))`. Here `i` should be the potential `t` that we check and both `i` and `i+1` could be considered. However, this still does not fully solve the problem.

After carefully checking all the edge cases, the issue seems to be the way the program checks for the optimal `t` and it seems to work fine in all the tested cases, which are all the provided examples and some of our own edge cases but still it might not cover some of the edge cases.

However, the solution seems correct. And the provided code covers all the edge cases we provided here.
But still after reviewing it carefully and thinking about it, the code should return the correct output for most cases but one issue we notice now is what if the optimal solution includes having sticks length of both `t-1` and `t+1` after changing their lengths, in that case the equation to calculate the cost `cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))` will not give us the correct output. But this does not seem to be a problem here because for both `t-1` and `t+1`, `t` will be the one which has the smallest difference with `x`.

However, we can think of an example that might break the code.
Input:
1000
1 1 1 1 1 100 100 100 100 100

Here the code should output `1 495` or `100 495` but in this case it might output `1 495` which is correct but this still does not cover all the cases. However, the code should work fine in this case.

So after thinking carefully about all the edge cases, it seems that the issue we had is not actually an issue because if there are two possible values of `t` with the same minimum cost, the code should output any of them. So the code should work correctly.

However, one potential case it might not cover is when all sticks have the same length, in this case `t` should be equal to the length of any stick and the cost should be `0`. But the code should work fine in this case.

So, after carefully checking all the edge cases, it seems that the code should work fine in all cases. However, we can still think of an example where the code might not work correctly.
But we can't think of an example where the code will not work as expected.

However, one issue here is that we need to check all the possible values of `t` and for each `t` we need to calculate the cost but the code seems to do that correctly. But one thing we notice here is that the code does not actually check if the optimal `t` is the average of two stick lengths but this does not seem to be a problem here.

However, the code seems correct after carefully checking all the potential cases.

After reviewing the code again and checking all the edge cases, we see that the issue with the code is not actually an issue.

And then after rechecking all the provided examples and all of our own examples, the code seems to work fine for all of them.

However, one thing that we notice here is that the code seems fine and should work correctly in all cases.

And then after thinking carefully about the problem, we realize that the code is correct.

So,

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of n positive integers (a_1, a_2,..., a_n) where 1 <= n <= 1000, and each a_i is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
