Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code calculates the minimum sum of distances to two consecutive points, but it doesn't consider all possible pairs of consecutive points. The code starts from the median value and checks all points to its left and right, but it checks the points to the left and right in a way that it minimizes the cost to two consecutive points. However, the code is trying to find the point `t` such that all sticks are almost good for `t`, meaning their length is at most 1 away from `t`. 

To achieve the minimum cost, the code should check all possible values of `t` and calculate the cost, which is the sum of the distances from each stick to `t`. The distance should be 0 if the stick is already almost good for `t`, and the minimum distance to `t` or `t + 1` or `t - 1` if it's not.

In the code, this point is not being checked correctly. For example, consider the case when all sticks have length 2, and `t` is 3. In this case, the cost should be 1 (because we can change all sticks to 3), but the code will not consider this case.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - (t - 1)), abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```
