Correctness: **False**

The program is attempting to solve the problem by finding the median of the stick lengths and then checking the costs of changing the lengths to be almost good for the median and the surrounding points. However, it does not consider all possible points between 1 and 100 as the target value, but only the ones around the median.

The problem description requires finding the minimum cost and the corresponding value of t that makes all sticks almost good, where t can be any positive integer. The program only checks the costs for points in the range from the median to 1 and 100, which may not include the optimal solution.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] with n = 10, the median is 5.5, and the program will only check the costs for points around 5 and 6, but it may not consider the point 5 or 6 itself as the optimal solution, or points further away from the median that could potentially have a lower cost.

To fix this issue, the program should check all possible points between 1 and 100, not just the ones around the median. Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):  # Check all possible points between 1 and 100
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1)), abs(x - (t - 1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```

This corrected code checks all possible points between 1 and 100, calculates the cost for each point, and keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding point. It then prints the point with the minimum cost and the minimum cost itself.
