According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `mid - 2`. 
State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`**
