The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`, which is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `min_cost` is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)`, `min_t` has its updated values, `t` is `mid`, `cost` is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)`, `i` is `mid - 2`.
