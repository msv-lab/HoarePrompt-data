The value of `cost` is updated to be the sum of the minimum absolute difference between each stick length `x` and either `i` or `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`cost` becomes `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`. 

The value of `n` is still an input integer that must be at least 4, 
the value of `sticks` is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, 
the value of `mid` is still the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, 
the value of `t` is still equal to `mid`, 
the value of `min_cost` is still equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`, 
the value of `min_t` is still equal to `mid`, 
and the value of `i` is still `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `cost` is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`, `min_t` is equal to `mid`, and `i` is `mid - 1`**
