The value of `cost` is updated to be the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and the two possible target lengths `i` and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `mid - 2` and `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, we can express `i` as `mid - 2`, and thus `i + 1` as `mid - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `min_cost` and `min_t` have their updated values, `t` is `mid`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and the two lengths `mid - 2` and `mid - 1`, `i` is `mid - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `min_cost` and `min_t` have their updated values, `t` is `mid`, `cost` is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)`, `i` is `mid - 2`**
