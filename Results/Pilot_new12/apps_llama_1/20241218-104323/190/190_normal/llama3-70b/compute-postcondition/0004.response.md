To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` (with 0-based indexing).

The code calculates:
```python
cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
```

Here, `cost` is assigned the sum of the absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and the middle element `mid`. Given that `sticks` is sorted and `mid` is its middle element, this calculation essentially computes the sum of the absolute deviations of all stick lengths from the median stick length.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `sticks` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` remains the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`.

The new information after executing the code is:
- `cost` is the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length and the median stick length (`mid`).

Therefore, the output state, considering all variables and their updated values or expressions, is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, and `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`**.
