Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, if `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)` is less than the current `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)` and `min_t` is updated to `mid - 2`.***
