To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given code snippet and how it affects the variables.

The given initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2.
- `i` is `mid - 2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
```

The impact of this code on the program is the introduction of a new variable `cost`, which is calculated based on the distances of each element `x` in `sticks` to `i` and `i + 1`. For each `x`, it takes the minimum distance between `x` and `i` or `x` and `i + 1`, and sums these distances for all elements in `sticks`.

Given that:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- `sticks` remains unchanged; it is only iterated over to calculate `cost`.
- `mid` remains unchanged; it was defined based on `n` and `sticks`, neither of which changes.
- `i` is defined based on `mid`, and since `mid` does not change, `i` remains the same.
- `cost` is a new variable that is introduced, calculated as the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `i`, with the addition of the newly calculated `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`.**
