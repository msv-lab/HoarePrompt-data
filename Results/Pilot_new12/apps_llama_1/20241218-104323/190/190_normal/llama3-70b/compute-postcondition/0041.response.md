To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates from `mid + 1` to `100` (inclusive), where `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of the sorted list `sticks`. For each iteration `i`, it calculates a `cost` which is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i - 1`. If this `cost` is less than the current `min_cost`, it updates `min_cost` with this new `cost` and sets `min_t` to the current `i`.

1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `min_cost` is initialized as the minimum sum of distances between each element in `sticks` and the points `mid - 1` and `mid`, and `min_t` is set to `mid`. This initialization step is crucial for understanding the starting point of the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop executes for each `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`. For each `i`, it checks if the current `cost` (sum of minimum distances to `i` and `i - 1`) is less than `min_cost`. If it is, `min_cost` is updated to this new `cost`, and `min_t` is set to `i`.

3. **Final State**: After the loop finishes all its iterations, `min_cost` will hold the minimum sum of distances found across all iterations, and `min_t` will be the `i` value that achieved this minimum sum. If no iteration found a `cost` less than the initial `min_cost`, then `min_t` remains `mid`, indicating that the minimum cost was achieved at the initialization step.

4. **Edge Cases**: If `mid` is 100, the loop does not execute because the range starts from `mid + 1` to `100`. In such a case, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their initial values, with `min_t` being `mid` (100 in this case).

Given this understanding, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

- `n` remains an input integer.
- `sticks` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` remains the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`.
- `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid` to `100`.
- `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum, or `mid` if no smaller cost was found during the loop's execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and two consecutive points in the range from `mid` to `100`, and `min_t` is the point that achieves this minimum sum, defaulting to `mid` if the loop does not find a smaller cost.**
