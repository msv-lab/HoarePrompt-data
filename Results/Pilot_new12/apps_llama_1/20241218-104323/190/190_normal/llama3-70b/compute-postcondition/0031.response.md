According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is 101. If `i` is less than 101, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. So, `i` becomes `mid + 2`. The rest of the state remains the same, but `mid` being less than 100 is not relevant for the loop execution, it is relevant for the `mid` calculation before the loop. We also don't know the value of `min_cost` after the last iteration, but it is not relevant for the loop execution. The same applies to `min_t`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `min_cost` and `min_t` have some values**
