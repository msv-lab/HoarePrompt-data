The value of `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `cost`, which is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and the two values `i` and `i - 1`. The other variables are not affected. 

`cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`, and `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`. 

The value of `min_t` is not changed, and the values of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`, and `cost` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`, and `min_t` has some value**
