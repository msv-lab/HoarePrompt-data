The value of `min_t` is updated to `i`. The value of `i` is `(n // 2) + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, `min_t` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 3)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2))) for x in sticks)`, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 3)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2))) for x in sticks)`.
