Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, if `cost` (which equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 3)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2))) for x in sticks)`) is less than `min_cost`, then `min_t` equals `(n // 2) + 3` and `min_cost` equals `cost`; otherwise, `min_t` and `min_cost` retain their previous values.**
