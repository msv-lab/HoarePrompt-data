Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, if `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)` is less than the original `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)` and `min_t` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, otherwise `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their original values***
