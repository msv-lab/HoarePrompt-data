To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`.
- `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`.
- `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`.
- `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`.
- `min_t` has some value.

The code is `min_t = i`, which assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`.

Given that `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, we can say that `min_t` is now equal to `(n // 2) + 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`, `min_cost`, `cost`) do not change because of this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order.
- `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`.
- `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`.
- `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`.
- `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`.
- `min_t` equals `(n // 2) + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`, and `min_t` equals `(n // 2) + 2`.**
