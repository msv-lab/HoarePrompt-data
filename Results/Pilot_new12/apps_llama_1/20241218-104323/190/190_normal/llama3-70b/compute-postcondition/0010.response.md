Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `cost` is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` is equal to `mid`, `min_cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`, `min_t` is equal to `mid`, and `i` is `mid - 1`. The current value of `cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
