The code assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. The values of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`, and `cost` are not changed by this operation. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`, and `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.
