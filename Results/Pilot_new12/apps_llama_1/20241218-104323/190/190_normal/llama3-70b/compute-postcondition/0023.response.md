Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is equal to `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `i` which is `mid - 2`.**
