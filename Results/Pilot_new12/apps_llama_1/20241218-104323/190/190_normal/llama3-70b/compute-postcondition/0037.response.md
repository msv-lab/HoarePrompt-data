The value of `cost` is assigned the sum of the minimum between the absolute difference of each stick length `x` and `i`, and the absolute difference of each stick length `x` and `i - 1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their values from the previous iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their values from the previous iteration, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 3)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2))) for x in sticks)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 3`, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their values from the previous iteration, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 3)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2))) for x in sticks)`**
