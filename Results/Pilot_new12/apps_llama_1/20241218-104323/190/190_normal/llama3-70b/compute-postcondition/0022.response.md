The value of `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`min_t` is equal to `i`, which is `mid - 2`. 
The value of `n` is at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`, and `min_cost` is equal to `cost`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, `i` is `mid - 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element `x` in `sticks` and the points `i` and `i + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is equal to `i` which is `mid - 2`**
