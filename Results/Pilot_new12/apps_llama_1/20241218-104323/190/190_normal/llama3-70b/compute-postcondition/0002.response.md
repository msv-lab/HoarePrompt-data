The code snippet `sticks.sort()` sorts the list `sticks` in ascending order. 

The sorting operation only affects the `sticks` list, leaving the value of `n` unchanged. 

The initial state specified that `n` is an input integer and `sticks` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive). 

After the sorting operation, `sticks` will still be a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive), but now in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order**
