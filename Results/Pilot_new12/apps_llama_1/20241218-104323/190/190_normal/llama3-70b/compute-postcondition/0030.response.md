Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` is `mid + 1`, if `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)` is less than the current `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)` and `min_t` is `mid + 1`.***
