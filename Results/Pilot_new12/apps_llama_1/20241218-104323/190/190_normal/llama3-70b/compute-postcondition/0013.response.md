Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks` that must be at least 2, if `cost` (which is `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`) is less than `min_cost` (which is initially `sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)`), then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, `min_t` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `t` remains `mid`, otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their initial values, with `i` being `mid - 1` in all cases.**
