Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum distances, `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum, or `mid` if the loop does not execute, `i` is `mid + 1`, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, and the current value of `cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`**
