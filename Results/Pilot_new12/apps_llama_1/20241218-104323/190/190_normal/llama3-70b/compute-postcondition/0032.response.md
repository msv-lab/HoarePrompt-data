The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of the minimum of the absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and `i`, and the absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and `i - 1`. 

Given `n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `min_cost` and `min_t` have some values, we know `i` equals `mid + 2`, which equals `(n // 2) + 2`. 

The states of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `i`, `min_cost`, and `min_t` are not affected by the calculation of `cost`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, `min_cost` and `min_t` have some values, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) in ascending order, `mid` is less than 100 and is the `n // 2`th element of `sticks`, `i` equals `(n // 2) + 2`, `min_cost` and `min_t` have some values, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - ((n // 2) + 2)), abs(x - ((n // 2) + 1))) for x in sticks)`**
