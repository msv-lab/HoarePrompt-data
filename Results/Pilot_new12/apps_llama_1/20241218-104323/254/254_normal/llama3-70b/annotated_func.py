#State of the program right berfore the function call: k1, k2, and k3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k1, k2, k3 ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, and `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the original value of `a`, which is its own greatest common divisor with 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`. It accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD. The function operates correctly for all integer values of `a` and `b`, including cases where `b` is initially 0, in which case it returns `a`. The GCD calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers. Note that the return postcondition stating the program returns the original value of `a` as its own greatest common divisor with 0 seems incorrect, as the function actually returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, not the GCD of `a` and 0.
