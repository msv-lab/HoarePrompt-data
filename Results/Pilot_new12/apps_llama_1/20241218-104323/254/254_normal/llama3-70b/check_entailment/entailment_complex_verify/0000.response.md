The original assessment claims that the provided program is incorrect, and it suggests a different approach based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals. 

After analyzing the annotated version of the code, it appears that the original assessment is correct. The program attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that there is at least one lit garland at every second after switching them on.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` calculates the GCD of two input integers `a` and `b`. However, the main part of the program still uses the LCM calculation and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a correct approach.

The correct approach, as suggested by the original assessment, is to check if the GCD of the three intervals is 1. If the GCD is 1, then the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that there exists a solution such that at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**. 

The reason for this assessment is that the program's approach based on the LCM calculation is not sufficient to ensure that there is at least one lit garland at every second after switching them on, and the correct approach based on the GCD calculation is not implemented in the program.
