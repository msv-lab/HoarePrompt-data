Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem asks to determine if it's possible to choose three integers `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_3` (not necessarily distinct) so that starting from `max(x_1, x_2, x_3)`, at least one garland will be lit every second.

The given program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and checks if `lcm` is divisible by `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual problem of covering every second after `max(x_1, x_2, x_3)` with at least one lit garland.

The program's logic seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem. Calculating the LCM and checking its divisibility by the individual `k` values does not directly address the requirement of ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second after the maximum start time.

A correct approach would involve analyzing the patterns of the garlands' on-states to determine if there exists a set of start times that would ensure coverage of every second. This might involve considering the remainders of the start times modulo the `k` values or using a more complex algorithm to find a set of start times that guarantees complete coverage.

The provided program does not follow the problem description and does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
