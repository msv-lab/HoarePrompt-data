Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three input numbers and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the numbers. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual problem of finding a moment to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second after that moment.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of switch-on moments for the garlands and verifying if there is at least one lit garland every second after the maximum of these moments. The provided code does not do this and instead relies on an incorrect heuristic involving the LCM of the input numbers.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The code will calculate the LCM of these numbers and determine if it is divisible by each of them. However, it will not find a correct solution because it does not consider the actual problem of finding a moment to switch on the garlands. In fact, the output for this input should be `NO`, but the code may not always produce the correct output for this case, depending on the specific LCM calculation and divisibility checks.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed, such as using a simulation or a more advanced mathematical technique to find a valid switch-on moment for the garlands. The provided code does not implement such an approach and is therefore incorrect.
