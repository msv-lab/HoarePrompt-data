The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers to determine if it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. However, the annotated version of the code and the problem description suggest that the program is actually checking if the LCM of the three numbers is a multiple of each of the numbers. 

Upon closer inspection, the program's logic seems to be flawed. The program calculates the LCM of the three numbers and checks if it is a multiple of each of the numbers. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem. 

A correct solution would involve checking the GCD of the numbers and using this information to determine if it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. 

The provided example in the original assessment, where the input is "2 4 6", is a good counterexample. The LCM of these numbers is 12, and 12 is divisible by all three numbers. According to the program, this should print "YES". However, if we choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, and x3 = 3, we can see that there will be a gap at second 12 + 1 = 13, where no garland is lit. This means the program does not work correctly for this input.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect. The reason for this is that the program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly solve the problem. 

The correct solution would involve checking if the GCD of any two garlands' periods is 1, and if the GCD of all three garlands' periods is 1. 

Final: **False**
