Correctness: **False**

The code attempts to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of three numbers and checks if it is a multiple of each number. However, the approach to solving the problem is incorrect. The code does not consider the actual problem of arranging the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second.

A counterexample to the code's correctness is the input (2, 4, 3). The code calculates the LCM as 12 and since 12 is a multiple of 2, 4, and 3, it prints 'YES'. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that no matter how we arrange the garlands, there will always be a second where no garland is lit.

The code does not consider the possibility of offsetting the starting times of the garlands to ensure that at least one garland is lit every second. This is a key aspect of the problem, and the code fails to account for it.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible starting times and offsets to determine if it's possible to arrange the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second. The current code does not do this and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
