Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers to determine if it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. However, this approach is not correct.

A counterexample is when the input is "2 4 6". The LCM of these numbers is 12, and 12 is divisible by all three numbers. According to the program, this should print "YES". However, if we choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, and x3 = 3, we can see that there will be a gap at second 12 + 1 = 13, where no garland is lit. This means the program does not work correctly for this input.

The correct approach involves checking if there exists a set of starting times for the garlands such that every second after the maximum starting time has at least one lit garland. This requires a more complex algorithm than simply calculating the LCM. 

To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the garlands and how their periods interact. We should check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two garlands' periods is 1, and if the GCD of all three garlands' periods is 1. If the GCD of any two garlands' periods is 1, then we can always find a starting time for the third garland such that it covers the gaps left by the first two garlands. 

However, the provided code does not implement this correctly, which is why it's incorrect. 

In the provided code, the function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The code then uses this function to calculate the LCM of the three numbers. However, as mentioned earlier, this approach is not correct. 

A correct solution would involve checking the GCD of the numbers and using this information to determine if it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. 

Here's a simple example of how the code could be modified to correctly solve the problem:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())

if gcd(k1, k2) == 1 or gcd(k2, k3) == 1 or gcd(k1, k3) == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This code checks if the GCD of any two garlands' periods is 1. If it is, then it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. Otherwise, it prints "NO". 

This solution assumes that if the GCD of any two garlands' periods is 1, then we can always find a starting time for the third garland such that it covers the gaps left by the first two garlands. This is a correct assumption, and it's the basis for the correct solution to this problem.
