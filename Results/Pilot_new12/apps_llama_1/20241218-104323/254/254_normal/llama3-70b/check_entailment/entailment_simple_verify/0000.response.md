The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals. However, this approach is not correct because it does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland at every second after switching them on.

The annotated version of the code provides more insight into the program's behavior, particularly into the `func_1` function, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. However, the main issue with the original program remains: it incorrectly uses the LCM and divisibility checks to determine the possibility of having at least one lit garland at every second.

The correct approach, as mentioned in the original assessment, involves checking if the GCD of the three intervals is 1, which guarantees the existence of a solution where at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on. The provided correct implementation in the original assessment demonstrates this approach.

Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect is accurate. The program does not properly address the problem's requirements, and the approach it takes does not lead to the correct solution.

Final: **False**
