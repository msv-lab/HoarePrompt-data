Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. However, the condition for printing 'YES' is incorrect. The program checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that there is at least one lit garland at every second after switching them on.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input: 3 4 5

In this case, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60, which is divisible by each of the intervals. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, we can observe that there are seconds when no garland is lit.

A correct approach would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals is 1. If the GCD is 1, then the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that there exists a solution such that at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
import math

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

gcd12 = func_1(k1, k2)
gcd123 = func_1(gcd12, k3)

if gcd123 == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This implementation correctly checks if the GCD of the three intervals is 1, ensuring that there exists a solution such that at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on.
