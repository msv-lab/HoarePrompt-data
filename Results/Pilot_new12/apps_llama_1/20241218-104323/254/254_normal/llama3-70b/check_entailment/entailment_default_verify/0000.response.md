To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the key components:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to determine if it's possible to switch on three garlands in such a way that each second after switching them on, at least one garland will be lit. The lighting pattern of each garland is periodic, with each garland being lit at seconds `x`, `x + k_i`, `x + 2k_i`, etc., where `x` is the second the garland is switched on, and `k_i` is the interval for the `i-th` garland.

2. **Provided Program**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, using a function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is used in the LCM calculation. It then checks if the LCM is divisible by each of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and prints 'YES' if it is, indicating that the condition can be met, and 'NO' otherwise.

3. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the program is incorrect, suggesting that it does not properly solve the problem. It points out that the condition checked by the program (LCM being divisible by each interval) is not sufficient to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second after switching them on. It proposes an alternative approach involving the GCD of the intervals, suggesting that if the GCD of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, then the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a solution.

4. **Output Hints**: The hints explain how the `func_1` calculates the GCD of two input integers using the Euclidean algorithm. They clarifies that the function works correctly for all integer values, including when `b` is initially 0, in which case it returns `a`.

Given this information, let's evaluate the program's correctness:

- The program attempts to solve the problem by checking the divisibility of the LCM by each interval. However, this approach might seem plausible at first glance because it aims to find a common period after which the pattern of the garlands would ensure at least one is lit every second. 

- The original assessment criticizes this approach by pointing out that the LCM being divisible by each `k_i` does not guarantee that there will be at least one garland lit every second. This criticism is valid because the mere divisibility does not consider the initial phases of the garland lighting patterns.

- The alternative suggested by the original assessment involves checking if the GCD of the intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. This is a more appropriate method because if the GCD is 1, it implies that the intervals have no common factor other than 1, which aligns with the conditions under which the Chinese Remainder Theorem can guarantee a solution. This theorem is relevant because it provides a way to find a simultaneous solution for the system of congruences that represent the lighting patterns of the garlands.

Considering these points, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect seems justified. The program's approach, while attempting to address the periodic nature of the garland lighting, does not adequately account for the necessity of having at least one garland lit every second after switching them on. The alternative approach suggested, focusing on the GCD of the intervals, provides a more theoretically sound method for determining the possibility of meeting the condition specified in the problem.

Therefore, based on the information and analysis provided:

Final: **False**
