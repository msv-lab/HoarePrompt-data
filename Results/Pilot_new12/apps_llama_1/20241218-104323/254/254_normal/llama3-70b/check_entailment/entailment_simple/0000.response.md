To determine the correctness of the given program, let's first understand what the program is supposed to do according to the problem description and then analyze the given code.

The problem description asks us to determine if it's possible to switch on three garlands in such a way that after switching them on, there will be at least one lit garland during each second. The garlands are switched on at seconds `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, and they light up at seconds `x`, `x + ki`, `x + 2ki`, and so on, where `ki` is the time interval of the `i-th` garland.

The given program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` using the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (gcd(k1, k2) * gcd(k2, k3) * gcd(k1, k3))`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. If the LCM is a multiple of all three time intervals, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that there will be at least one lit garland during each second.

However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual problem of covering all seconds after the maximum switch-on time. The LCM being a multiple of all three time intervals does not guarantee that there will be no gaps in the coverage.

A correct approach would be to check if the greatest common divisor of any two time intervals is less than or equal to the third time interval, or if the time intervals can be paired in such a way that their LCM covers all seconds.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect approach to solve the problem. The problem requires checking if the time intervals can be arranged such that there are no gaps in the coverage, but the program only checks if the LCM of the time intervals is a multiple of all three time intervals, which is not sufficient to guarantee that there will be no gaps. 

Here is a correct version of the program:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())

# Check if the time intervals can be paired to cover all seconds
if gcd(k1, k2) <= k3 or gcd(k1, k3) <= k2 or gcd(k2, k3) <= k1:
    print('YES')
elif lcm(k1, k2) <= k3 or lcm(k1, k3) <= k2 or lcm(k2, k3) <= k1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This program first checks if the greatest common divisor of any two time intervals is less than or equal to the third time interval, which guarantees that there will be no gaps in the coverage. If this condition is not met, it checks if the least common multiple of any two time intervals is less than or equal to the third time interval, which also guarantees that there will be no gaps. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that there will be at least one lit garland during each second.
