According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is `True`, the loop can execute. However, right before the loop, there is no information given about the value of `b`. The given information is about `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500. This information about `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` does not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop condition depends solely on `b`. For the loop to execute at least one time, `b` must be `True`.

State: **k1, k2, and k3 are integers such that 1 ≤ k1, k2, k3 ≤ 1500, and b must be True**
