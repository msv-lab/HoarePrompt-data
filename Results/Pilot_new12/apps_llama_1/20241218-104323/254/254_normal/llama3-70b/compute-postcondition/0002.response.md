According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is True (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0, which means the loop will not execute again in its current state. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value.

State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, `a` is `1`, and `b` is not `0`**
