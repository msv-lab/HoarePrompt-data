The code `a, b = b, a % b` affects the variables `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is `1` and `b` is not `0`. 

The new value of `a` becomes `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes `a % b`. Since `a` is initially `1`, `a % b` will always be `1` (because 1 divided by any non-zero number gives a remainder of 1 if the divisor is greater than 1, or 0 if the divisor is 1, but since `b` is not 0 and `a` is 1, `a % b` equals 0 when `b` equals 1, and 1 otherwise).

However, we also need to consider the case when `b` equals 1. In that case, `a % b` would be 0. 

So, after the code is executed:
- `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- `b` becomes `0` if the old `b` equals 1, and `1` otherwise.

The variables `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, and their values do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is `0` if the old `b` equals 1, and `1` otherwise.
Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is `0` if the old `b` equals 1, `b` is `1` otherwise**
