The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. However, the provided output description does not depend on `b` or the constraints of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. According to the given information, the function returns the original value of `a`, which is also described as its own greatest common divisor with 0. Since the greatest common divisor of any number with 0 is the number itself (as the GCD operation is defined such that GCD(a, 0) = a for any a), the function essentially returns `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b` and return the value of `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the value of a.**
