The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are not affected by the code. The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then updates the new value of `b` to be the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`. 

Since `b` must be True, we know that `b` is initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in a numeric context. However, the initial value of `a` is unknown. 

Let's consider the new value of `a`, which is the old value of `b`. Since `b` is True, the new value of `a` is `True` or `1`. 

The new value of `b` is `a % b`, where `a` is the old value of `a` and `b` is the old value of `b`. Since `b` is initially `True` (or `1`), `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `1`, which is always `0`. 

However, we must note that the problem statement does not explicitly state the initial values of `a` and `b` other than `b` being `True`. 

Given this information, we know that after the code is executed, `a` will be `True` (or `1`), and `b` will be `0`, because any integer modulo `1` is `0`. 

The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, `a` is `1`, and `b` is `0`**
