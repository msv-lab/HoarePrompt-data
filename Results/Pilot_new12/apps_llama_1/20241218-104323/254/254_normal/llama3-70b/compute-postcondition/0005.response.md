The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then updates `b` to be the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`. Given that `a` is initially 1 and `k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers between 1 and 1500, the initial state of `b` must allow it to become 1 again for the loop to execute. 

Since `a` is initially 1, after the first execution of the code, `a` will become the old value of `b` and `b` will become 1 (because 1 % `b` equals 1 when `b` is greater than 1, and since `b`'s new value is dependent on `a` % `b`, for `b` to become 1 again, the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` should be 1, but given `a`'s initial value is 1, `b` will always become 1 after the first iteration). Thus, the loop can execute again if `b`'s new value allows it, meaning if `b` is set to 1 after the first iteration.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `k1`, `k2`, `k3` remain integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500.
- `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- `b` becomes 1 because `a` % `b` equals 1 when `a` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1, but since `a` is initially 1, this step essentially sets `b` to 1 after the first iteration.

However, to accurately describe the state after the given operation without assuming `b` must become 1 (since that would imply `a` % `b` = 1, which is not necessarily true unless `b` = 1 from the start or due to the specific mathematical properties of `a` and `b` before the swap), we should note:
- `a` takes the value of the old `b`.
- `b` takes the value of `a` % `b`, where `a` is initially 1, so `b` becomes 1 % `b`, which simplifies to just 1 if `b` > 1, because 1 divided by any number greater than 1 gives a remainder of 1. But the key point is `a` % `b` when `a` is 1 results in 1 for any `b` > 1.

Thus, considering the specific operation and initial conditions:
- The values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3` do not change.
- `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- `b` becomes 1, given `a`'s initial value of 1.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500, `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is 1.**
