Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the three time intervals is 1, and if so, it outputs 'YES'. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that there will always be at least one lit garland.

A counterexample is when k1 = 2, k2 = 4, and k3 = 4. The gcd of these numbers is 2, so the program will output 'NO'. However, if we switch on the first garland during the 1st second, the second garland during the 2nd second, and the third garland during the 1st second, then the first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5,..., the second garland will be lit during seconds 2, 6, 10,..., and the third garland will be lit during seconds 1, 5, 9,.... As we can see, every second after the 2nd second will have at least one lit garland, so the program should output 'YES'.

The correct solution should check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify that there will always be at least one lit garland after the maximum of the switching times. 

Here's an example of a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    for x1 in range(1, 1501):
        for x2 in range(x1, 1501):
            for x3 in range(x2, 1501):
                lit = [False] * 3001
                for i in range(x1, 3001, k1):
                    lit[i] = True
                for i in range(x2, 3001, k2):
                    lit[i] = True
                for i in range(x3, 3001, k3):
                    lit[i] = True
                if all(lit[x3:]):
                    print("YES")
                    return
    print("NO")
```

This solution checks all possible combinations of switching times and verifies that there will always be at least one lit garland after the maximum of the switching times. If it finds a combination that satisfies this condition, it outputs 'YES' and returns. If it checks all combinations and doesn't find a satisfying one, it outputs 'NO'. 

However, please note that this solution has an exponential time complexity and may not be feasible for large inputs. A more efficient solution would be to find a mathematical condition that is equivalent to the problem statement and can be checked in polynomial time.
