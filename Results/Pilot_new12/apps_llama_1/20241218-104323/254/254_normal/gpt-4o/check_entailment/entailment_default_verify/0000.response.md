Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I will re-evaluate the original assessment.

The original assessment claims that the given code does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

However, the output hints provide a different perspective. The function calculates the GCD of the three time intervals and prints 'YES' if the final GCD is 1, indicating that the time intervals are coprime. This is actually a correct condition to check for this problem.

If the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, it means that the time intervals are coprime, and therefore, it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. This is because the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that for any coprime numbers, there exists a solution to the system of congruences.

On the other hand, if the GCD of the three time intervals is not 1, it means that the time intervals are not coprime, and therefore, it may not be possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is actually correct.

The reason why the original assessment was incorrect is that it misunderstood the condition for determining if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. The condition is not that the LCM of any two of the time intervals is a multiple of the third, but rather that the GCD of the three time intervals is 1.

Final: **True**
