Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The problem statement requires that it is possible to switch on the garlands at some moments in time so that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

However, the program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals of the garlands is 1. This is a necessary condition for the garlands to cover all seconds, but it is not sufficient.

The program does not consider the actual time intervals and how they can be used to cover all seconds. For example, if the time intervals are 2, 2, and 3, the program will print 'YES' because the GCD is 1. However, this is a valid solution because the garlands can be switched on at seconds 1, 2, and 1, respectively, and at least one garland will be lit during each second after switching them on.

On the other hand, if the time intervals are 4, 2, and 3, the program will incorrectly print 'YES' because the GCD is 1. However, it is not possible to switch on the garlands so that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

A correct solution would need to consider the actual time intervals and how they can be used to cover all seconds. The program would need to check if there exists a moment in time when each garland can be switched on so that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

For example, a correct solution could use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem. The program would need to check if there exists a solution that satisfies the following conditions:

- For each garland, there exists a moment in time when it can be switched on so that it is lit during that second.
- At least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

The program provided does not consider these conditions and therefore does not always follow the problem description.
