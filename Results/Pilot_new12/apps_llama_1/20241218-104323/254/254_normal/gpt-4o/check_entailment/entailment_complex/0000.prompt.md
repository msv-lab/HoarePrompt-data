You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: no input parameters, but the input are three integers k_1, k_2, and k_3 which are the time intervals of the garlands, where 1 <= k_1, k_2, k_3 <= 1500.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. If `gcd_all` equals 1, 'YES' has been printed. If `gcd_all` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers k_1, k_2, and k_3 from user input, representing time intervals of garlands, where 1 <= k_1, k_2, k_3 <= 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k_1 and k_2, and then the GCD of the result with k_3. If the final GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that the time intervals are coprime, otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output console with either 'YES' or 'NO'. All potential edge cases, such as the input values being within the specified range and the GCD calculation, are implicitly handled by the math.gcd function. The function does not validate the input range, so it will still calculate and print a result even if the input values are outside the range 1-1500.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
