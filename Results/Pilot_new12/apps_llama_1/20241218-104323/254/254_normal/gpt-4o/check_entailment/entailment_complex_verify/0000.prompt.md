You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

A counterexample is when the input is `2 2 3`. In this case, the GCD of `2`, `2`, and `3` is 1, so the program will print `YES`. However, it is indeed possible to choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1`, as explained in the problem description, which will result in all seconds being covered.

However, for the input `4 2 3`, the program will print `NO`, but it should actually check if the time intervals can be arranged such that every second is covered. 

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to check if the least common multiple (LCM) of any two of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is a multiple of the third, or if one of the time intervals is 1, because this would ensure that at least one garland is lit every second.

In the given code, it simply checks if the GCD of the three numbers is 1, which is not the correct condition to check for this problem. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: no input parameters, but the input are three integers k_1, k_2, and k_3 which are the time intervals of the garlands, where 1 <= k_1, k_2, k_3 <= 1500.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. If `gcd_all` equals 1, 'YES' has been printed. If `gcd_all` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers k_1, k_2, and k_3 from user input, representing time intervals of garlands, where 1 <= k_1, k_2, k_3 <= 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k_1 and k_2, and then the GCD of the result with k_3. If the final GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that the time intervals are coprime, otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output console with either 'YES' or 'NO'. All potential edge cases, such as the input values being within the specified range and the GCD calculation, are implicitly handled by the math.gcd function. The function does not validate the input range, so it will still calculate and print a result even if the input values are outside the range 1-1500.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
