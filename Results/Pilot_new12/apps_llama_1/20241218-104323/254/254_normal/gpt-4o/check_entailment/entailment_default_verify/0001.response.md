Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate. The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it only checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the three time intervals is 1, and if so, it outputs 'YES'. However, the output hints provide a different perspective. 

The output hints suggest that the program calculates the gcd of the three time intervals to determine if they are coprime. In number theory, a set of numbers is coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1. If the time intervals are coprime, it means that there is no common factor between them, and therefore, there will always be at least one lit garland after the maximum of the switching times. 

The program's approach is actually correct, as it checks if the time intervals are coprime by calculating their gcd. If the gcd is 1, it outputs 'YES', indicating that the time intervals are coprime and that there will always be at least one lit garland. If the gcd is not 1, it outputs 'NO', indicating that the time intervals are not coprime and that there may be seconds when no garland is lit. 

Therefore, I believe that the program is correct, and I change the original assessment.

Final: **True**
