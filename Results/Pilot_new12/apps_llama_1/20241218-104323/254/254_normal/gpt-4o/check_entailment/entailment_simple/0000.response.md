Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The reason is that the program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all three time intervals is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise. However, this is not the correct condition to check.

The problem description states that Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2, and x_3 so that during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3), at least one garland will be lit. The GCD condition does not guarantee this.

For example, consider the input 4 2 3. The GCD of all three time intervals is 1, but the program cannot choose x_1, x_2, and x_3 such that during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3), at least one garland will be lit. This is because the first garland will be lit every 4 seconds, the second garland will be lit every 2 seconds, and the third garland will be lit every 3 seconds. No matter what x_1, x_2, and x_3 are chosen, there will be some seconds where none of the garlands are lit.

A correct program would need to check all possible combinations of x_1, x_2, and x_3 to see if there exists a combination that satisfies the condition. Alternatively, a more efficient algorithm could be used to check if such a combination exists.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input: 4 2 3
Expected Output: NO
Actual Output: YES

This is because the program incorrectly prints 'YES' when the GCD of all three time intervals is 1, without checking if there actually exists a combination of x_1, x_2, and x_3 that satisfies the condition.
