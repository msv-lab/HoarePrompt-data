Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, there would be at least one lit garland. 

For example, given the input 2 2 3, the program should print 'YES', but this case does not necessarily imply that the final GCD is 1. However, the program checks if the GCD of the three input numbers is 1. 

A counterexample to the correctness of the code is the input 4 2 3. In this case, the code will print 'YES' because the GCD of 4, 2, and 3 is 1, but the problem description actually requires that there should be at least one lit garland in every second after switching the garlands on.

In the given code, checking the GCD does not fully cover the requirements of the problem. It is necessary to check if there is any gap in the sequence of lit seconds after switching the garlands on. 

One way to solve this problem is to model the sequence of lit seconds for each garland and check if there is any gap in the combined sequence. 

The given code does not handle this requirement and therefore does not meet the conditions specified in the problem description for every potential case.
