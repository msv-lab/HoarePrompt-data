Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly solve the problem. It checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1, but this is not sufficient to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland at every second after switching them on.

A counterexample is when the input is 4, 2, and 3. The GCD of these numbers is 1, but it is not possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on at least one garland will be lit.

This is because the first garland will be lit at seconds 1, 5, 9,..., the second garland will be lit at seconds 2, 4, 6, 8,..., and the third garland will be lit at seconds 3, 6, 9, 12,.... There will be seconds (like 7, 11, 15,...) when none of the garlands are lit.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**. 

The code should check if the time intervals can be used to cover all seconds after switching them on, not just if they are coprime. The problem description provides examples that the code does not handle correctly. 

Note: This solution assumes that the input values are valid and within the specified range, and does not include error checking for invalid inputs.
