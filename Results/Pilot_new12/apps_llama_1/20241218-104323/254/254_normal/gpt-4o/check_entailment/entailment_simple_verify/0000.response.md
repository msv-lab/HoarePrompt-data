The original assessment claims that the program's correctness is **False**, stating that the program only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

However, upon re-evaluation of the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the original assessment is incorrect. The problem statement requires that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. This can be achieved if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, meaning that there are no common factors between them (except 1), ensuring that every second will be covered by at least one garland.

The annotated version of the code supports this perspective, as it correctly calculates the GCD of the three time intervals and prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, indicating that it is possible to switch on the garlands such that every second is covered.

The original assessment provides a counterexample with the input `2 2 3`, claiming that the program will print 'YES' but it should actually print 'NO'. However, the correct interpretation of the problem statement and the provided code suggests that the program will indeed print 'YES' for this input, and it is correct to do so. The example provided in the problem description itself suggests that for the input `2 2 3`, it is possible to choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1`, resulting in all seconds being covered.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the refined assessment of the program's correctness is that the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is actually correct.

Final: **True**
