Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit.

A counterexample is when the input is `2 2 3`. In this case, the GCD of `2`, `2`, and `3` is 1, so the program will print `YES`. However, it is indeed possible to choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1`, as explained in the problem description, which will result in all seconds being covered.

However, for the input `4 2 3`, the program will print `NO`, but it should actually check if the time intervals can be arranged such that every second is covered. 

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to check if the least common multiple (LCM) of any two of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is a multiple of the third, or if one of the time intervals is 1, because this would ensure that at least one garland is lit every second.

In the given code, it simply checks if the GCD of the three numbers is 1, which is not the correct condition to check for this problem. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all cases.
