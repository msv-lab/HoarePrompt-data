The provided code prints 'YES' to the console. This operation does not modify the values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, or `gcd_all`. The states of these variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3` and equals 1, and 'YES' has been printed.**
