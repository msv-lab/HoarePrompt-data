The given code prints 'NO' to the console, but it does not modify any variables. The values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and `gcd_all` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed to the console**
