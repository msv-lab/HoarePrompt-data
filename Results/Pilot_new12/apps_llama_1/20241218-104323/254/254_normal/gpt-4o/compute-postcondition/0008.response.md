The function `func` accepts no parameters but uses the global integers `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` as input, where `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are the time intervals of the garlands, with the constraint that 1 <= `k_1`, `k_2`, `k_3` <= 1500. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the output, I can only describe the input parameters. However, I can still format it according to your request:


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but uses three global integers k_1, k_2, and k_3, and returns an unknown output based on these time intervals.**
