To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the code does. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3` and assigns it to `gcd_all`.

Given the initial state:
- `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500.
- `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500.
- `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500.
- `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.

The `math.gcd()` function returns the greatest common divisor of the two integers passed to it. Therefore, `gcd_all` will be the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` (which is the gcd of `k1` and `k2`) and `k3`.

After executing the code, the values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, and `gcd_k1_k2` remain unchanged because the operation does not modify these variables. The new variable `gcd_all` is introduced, which holds the gcd of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.

The output state, therefore, includes the unchanged values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, and `gcd_k1_k2`, along with the new value of `gcd_all`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`.**
