To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the code. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `k1` and `k2` using the `math.gcd()` function and assigns this value to the variable `gcd_k1_k2`. 

Given that `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `k2` is also an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` will be an integer between 1 and the minimum of `k1` and `k2`, because the gcd of two numbers cannot be greater than the smallest of the two numbers. 

The value of `k3` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the output state is: `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`**
