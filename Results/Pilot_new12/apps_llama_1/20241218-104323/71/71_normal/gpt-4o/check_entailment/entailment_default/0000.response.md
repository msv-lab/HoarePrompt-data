Correctness: **False**.

The code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where the result after removing digits should start with a zero correctly. The problem statement allows the result to start with a zero only if the result is zero itself and is represented as exactly one digit. However, the code simply counts the trailing zeros from the right and doesn't consider whether the remaining digits (if any) are leading zeros that should be removed.

For example, given the input `10203040 2`, the code should return `4` because the minimum number of digits to be deleted to get a number divisible by `10^2` is `4`, resulting in `0`. However, the current code doesn't correctly handle this scenario.

Additionally, the code doesn't consider the case where `n` is `0` and `k` is greater than `1`. In this case, the code should return `0` because the result after removing digits is already `0`, but it doesn't correctly handle this edge case.

The code also doesn't consider the case where `n` has leading zeros that need to be removed. The code should remove these leading zeros, but it doesn't correctly handle this scenario.

Finally, the code returns `len(n) - 1` when `n` doesn't have `k` trailing zeros. However, this is incorrect because it doesn't consider the case where `n` has some trailing zeros but not enough to reach `k`. In this case, the code should return the minimum number of digits to be deleted to get a number divisible by `10^k`, but it doesn't correctly handle this scenario.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
