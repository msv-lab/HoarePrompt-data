You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input is 100 and k is 9. The program should output 2 because we can remove the digits 1 and 0 to get 0, which is divisible by any number. However, the program outputs 1 because it is only checking for zeros from the right side of the number.

The program should instead be checking all possible substrings of the number and checking if they are divisible by 10^k. This would require a different approach, such as generating all possible substrings and checking their divisibility.

Another case where the program fails is when the number has leading zeros that need to be removed. For example, if the input is 00100 and k is 2, the program should output 2, but it currently does not handle leading zeros correctly.

To solve this problem, a more complex approach would be needed, potentially involving dynamic programming or a recursive solution to check all possible substrings and their divisibility by 10^k.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers as input, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000 and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). It processes the string representation of `n` from right to left, counting trailing zeros until it finds `k` zeros or reaches the start of `n`. If it finds `k` zeros, it returns the number of non-zero digits encountered after the last of these `k` zeros. If it doesn't find `k` zeros, it returns the length of `n` minus 1. The function doesn't explicitly handle edge cases such as `n` being 0 or `k` being greater than the number of digits in `n`, but based on the code, in such cases, it will either return 0 (if `n` has fewer than `k` zeros and is not a single digit) or the length of `n` minus 1 (if `n` has fewer than `k` zeros). The function does not raise any error messages for specific inputs as suggested in the overall description, but rather follows the logic described in the step-by-step annotations and code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
