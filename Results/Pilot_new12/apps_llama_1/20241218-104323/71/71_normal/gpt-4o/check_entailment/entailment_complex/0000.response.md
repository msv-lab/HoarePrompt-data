Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program counts the number of digits to be removed. 

In the problem description, it is stated that Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^k. This means that the program should find the minimum number of digits to be removed from the given number n so that the resulting number is divisible by 10^k.

However, the given program only checks the trailing zeros and non-zero digits from the end of the number n. It does not consider all possible combinations of digits that can be removed to make the number divisible by 10^k.

For example, consider the input 10203049 and k = 2. The program will count the trailing zeros and non-zero digits from the end of the number and return the count of non-zero digits, which is 7. However, the correct answer is 3, because we can remove the digits 2, 3, and 4 to get the number 1000490, which is divisible by 10^2.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of digits that can be removed to make the number divisible by 10^k. One possible solution is to use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of digits to be removed.

Here is an example of how the program can be modified:

```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n = str(n)
    target = 10 ** k
    
    min_count = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(n)):
        num = ''
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if (mask & (1 << i))!= 0:
                num += n[i]
        
        if num and int(num) % target == 0 and (num[0]!= '0' or num == '0'):
            min_count = min(min_count, bin(mask).count('0'))
    
    return min_count

n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min_digits_to_remove(n, k))
```
This modified program uses a bitmask to generate all possible combinations of digits that can be removed. It then checks each combination to see if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. The minimum number of digits to be removed is then returned.
