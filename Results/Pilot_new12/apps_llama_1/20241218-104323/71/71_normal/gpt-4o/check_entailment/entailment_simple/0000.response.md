Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n` so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. 

The problem with the program is that it only checks for trailing zeros in the number `n`. If `n` does not have `k` trailing zeros, the program prints `len(n) - 1`, which is incorrect. This is because the program does not consider the possibility of removing digits other than the trailing digits to make the number divisible by `10^k`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 120` and `k = 2`. The program checks for trailing zeros and finds only one, so it prints `len(n) - 1 = 2`. However, the correct answer is 1, because if we remove the digit '2', the remaining number '10' is divisible by `10^2 = 100`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of digits that can be kept from `n` to form a number divisible by `10^k`. This can be done by iterating through all possible subsequences of `n` and checking if they form a number divisible by `10^k`. The subsequence with the maximum length that forms a number divisible by `10^k` will give us the minimum number of digits to be deleted.

Here's a possible correct solution:
```python
def func():
    n, k = input().split()
    k = int(k)
    min_remove = len(n)

    for mask in range(1 << len(n)):
        subseq = ''
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if (mask & (1 << i))!= 0:
                subseq += n[i]

        if subseq and int(subseq) % (10 ** k) == 0:
            min_remove = min(min_remove, len(n) - len(subseq))

    print(min_remove)
```
This solution iterates through all possible subsequences of `n` using a bitmask and checks if each subsequence forms a number divisible by `10^k`. It keeps track of the minimum number of digits to be deleted to form a number divisible by `10^k`.
