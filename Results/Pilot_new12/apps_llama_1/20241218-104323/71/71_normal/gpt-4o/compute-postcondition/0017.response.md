The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial state conditions are still valid: `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). The conditions regarding `count_zeros` and `to_remove` also remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), if the current digit being processed is '0', then `count_zeros` is increased by 1 and `to_remove` remains unchanged, if the current digit is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1 and `count_zeros` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
