The code `break` does not modify the values of any variables, it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string with at least one more digit, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), if the current digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, if the current digit is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
