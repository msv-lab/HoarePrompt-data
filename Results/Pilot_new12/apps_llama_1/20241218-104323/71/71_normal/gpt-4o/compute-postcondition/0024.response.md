Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with at least one more digit, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If the current digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. If the current digit is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, the loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the execution continues.***
