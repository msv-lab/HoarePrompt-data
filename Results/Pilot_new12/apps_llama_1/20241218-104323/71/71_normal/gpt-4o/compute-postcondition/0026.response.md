Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, indicating that the number of trailing zeros in `n` is exactly `k`, and `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until the last of the `k` zeros or the start of `n` if fewer than `k` zeros exist, however since `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` will be the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until the last of the `k` zeros.**
