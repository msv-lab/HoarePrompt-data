To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the provided information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- The condition `count_zeros` equals `k` leads to a specific state: the last character of `n` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0. However, this scenario results in breaking out of the loop.
- If `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over `n` in reverse order:
```python
for digit in reversed(n):
```
At the end of the previous iteration:
- If the loop body resulted in breaking out (because `count_zeros` equals `k`), the state adjustments are based on the condition met: `n`'s last character is '0', `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0. However, since this condition breaks the loop, we consider the scenario where the loop continues.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must have more characters to process since it Iterates in reverse. Thus, removing the last processed character from consideration.

State adjustments for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `n` is processed from right to left, and assuming it doesn't end with a '0' that led to `count_zeros` equaling `k` and thus breaking the loop, `n` must still be a non-empty string after removing the last character that was processed.
- `k` remains between 1 and 9 (inclusive), as its value doesn't change with the iteration over `n`.
- If the loop didn't break (i.e., `count_zeros` didn't equal `k`), the state of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remains unchanged.
- Given the loop iterates in reverse, the next character to be processed would move one position to the left in the string `n`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` is still a string representation of a non-negative integer but now considering one less digit from the right.
- `k` remains an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- `count_zeros` and `to_remove`'s values are determined by the actions within the loop body, which isn't detailed here but implies `count_zeros` could be incremented if the next digit is '0', and other changes based on the loop's body logic not provided.

However, strictly based on the provided loop statement and without assuming the specific logic within the loop body that affects `count_zeros` and `to_remove`, and considering we are looking at how the state changes from one iteration to the next without the explicit loop body logic:

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `count_zeros` and `to_remove` as per the loop body's logic which isn't provided but would dictate their next state based on the current digit being processed**.
