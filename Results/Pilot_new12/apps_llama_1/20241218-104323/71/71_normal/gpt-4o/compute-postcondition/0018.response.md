Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), if the current digit being processed is '0', then `count_zeros` is increased by 1 and `to_remove` remains unchanged, if the current digit is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1 and `count_zeros` remains unchanged, and if `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the execution continues.**
