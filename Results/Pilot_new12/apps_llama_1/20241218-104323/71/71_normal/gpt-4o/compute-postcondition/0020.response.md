The code `count_zeros += 1` increments the value of `count_zeros` by 1. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `to_remove` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string with at least one more digit, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `count_zeros` is the previous value of `count_zeros` plus 1, and `to_remove` remains as previously determined by the loop body conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a string with at least one more digit, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `count_zeros` is `count_zeros` + 1, `to_remove` remains as previously determined by the loop body conditions**
