The code increments `to_remove` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000. The value of `k` also remains unchanged, being an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `to_remove` is incremented by 1, `count_zeros` remains as per the previous state**
