The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The last character of `n` (i.e., `digit`) is either '0' or not '0'. If the last character of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If the last character of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. Given that `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, we can conclude that if `k` is 1, then the last character of `n` is '0' and `to_remove` is 0. If `k` is not 1, then `k` must be between 2 and 9 (inclusive) and in this case `k` cannot be equal to `count_zeros` because `count_zeros` is either 0 or 1. However, according to the initial state, `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, so `k` must be 1 and the last character of `n` is '0' and `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is 1, the last character of `n` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
