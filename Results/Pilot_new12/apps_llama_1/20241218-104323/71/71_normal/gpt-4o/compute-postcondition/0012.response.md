Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then the last character of `n` is '0', `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
