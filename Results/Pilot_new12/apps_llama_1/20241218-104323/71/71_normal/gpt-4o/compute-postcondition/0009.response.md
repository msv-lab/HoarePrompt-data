Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), if the last character of `n` (i.e., `digit`) is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If the last character of `n` (i.e., `digit`) is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1.***
