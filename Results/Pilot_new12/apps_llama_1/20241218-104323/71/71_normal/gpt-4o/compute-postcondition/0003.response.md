To determine the output state, we analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `count_zeros` is 0. The given code snippet is:

```python
to_remove = 0
```

This code introduces a new variable `to_remove` and assigns it the value 0. It does not alter the values of `n`, `k`, or `count_zeros`. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows: 
- `n` remains a string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000.
- `k` remains an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- `count_zeros` remains 0.
- A new variable `to_remove` is introduced and assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `count_zeros` is 0, and `to_remove` is 0**
