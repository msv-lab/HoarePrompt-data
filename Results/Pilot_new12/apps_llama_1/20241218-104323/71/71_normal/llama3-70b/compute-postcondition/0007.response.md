To solve this, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: `n` is the input integer divided by 10 with a remainder when divided by 10, `w` is increased by 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
n //= 10
```

This operation performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. Given that `n` initially has a remainder when divided by 10, this means `n` had a non-zero last digit before the operation.

After the operation `n //= 10`, the last digit (the remainder when divided by 10) is discarded, and `n` becomes the integer part of the division of its original value by 10.

The state of `w` is not affected by this operation, as it is increased by 2 in the initial state and remains so after the operation on `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer divided by 100 (since the last two digits are effectively removed when considering the initial division by 10 and then this operation), `w` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 100, `w` is increased by 2**
