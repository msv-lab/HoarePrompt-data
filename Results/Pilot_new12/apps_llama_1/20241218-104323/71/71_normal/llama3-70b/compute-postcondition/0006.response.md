The code increments the value of `w` by 1. The initial state of `w` is that it is increased by 1, which means its initial value is some number plus 1. After the code is executed, `w` will be increased by 1 again, making it some number plus 2. The state of `n` is not affected by the code, so it remains the input integer divided by 10, with the condition that `n` must have a remainder when divided by 10 still holding true.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 10 with a remainder when divided by 10, `w` is increased by 2**
