To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while n % 10 ** k!= 0:
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as `n` modulo `10` raised to the power of `k` is not equal to `0`. In other words, the loop will execute if `n` is not a multiple of `10` raised to the power of `k`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer divided by 100.
- `w` is increased by 2.

From the loop condition, we can see that the value of `k` is crucial in determining whether the loop can execute again, but its current state is not provided. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states so that `n % 10 ** k!= 0` holds true.

Since `n` is the input integer divided by 100, for `n % 10 ** k` to not be `0`, `n` must not be a multiple of `10 ** k`. Given that `n` has been divided by 100 (which is `10 ** 2`), if `k` is 2 or less, `n` could potentially be a multiple of `10 ** k` depending on the original input integer, meaning the loop condition could be false.

For the loop to certainly execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is not a multiple of `10 ** k` after the division by 100. This implies that `k` must be less than the number of factors of 10 in `n` after division, or simply, `k` should be such that `n` remains not a multiple of `10 ** k` after the division.

However, since the precise value or range of `k` and its relation to `n` is not provided in the initial state, and considering we must ensure the loop can execute one more time based on the given condition, we must consider the condition where `n % 10 ** k!= 0` is true for the next iteration.

Given `w` is increased by 2, and there's no direct relation between `w` and the loop condition regarding `n` and `k`, the adjustment of `w` does not directly impact the loop's ability to execute again based on the provided condition.

Thus, focusing on the condition that must be met for the loop to execute again (`n % 10 ** k!= 0`), and acknowledging the lack of specific information about `k`'s value or its intended range, the most accurate adjustment we can infer based on the given task format is ensuring that `n` remains in a state where it's not a multiple of `10 ** k`, which could be influenced by the specifics of `k` and the original input integer.

State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 100 and must not be a multiple of `10 ** k`, `w` is increased by 2**
