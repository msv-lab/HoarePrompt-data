The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. The input accepts two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The previous conditions that `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 9 are no longer guaranteed as the new values are assigned based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer such that both are provided by the user**
