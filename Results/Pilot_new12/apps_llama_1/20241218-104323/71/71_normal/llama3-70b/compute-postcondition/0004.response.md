The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10, which effectively removes the last digit of `n`. The previous value of `n` was an input integer not divisible by 10, which means it had a non-zero last digit. After the division, `n` will be an integer representing all but the last digit of the original input. The state of `w` is not affected by this operation, so it remains increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 10 (integer division), `w` is increased by 1**
