The code increments the value of `w` by 1. The initial state of `n` is still valid after the code execution, which is `n` is the input integer divided by 100 and must not be a multiple of 10. Since `w` was not defined in the initial state, we will update it as `w` is increased by 1 from its previous unknown value.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 100 and must not be a multiple of 10, `w` is increased by 1 from its previous value**
