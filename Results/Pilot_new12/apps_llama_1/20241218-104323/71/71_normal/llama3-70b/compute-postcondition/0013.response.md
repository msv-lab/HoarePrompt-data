It seems like there's a mistake in the provided problem. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which means it doesn't accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `n` and `k`. For the sake of providing a meaningful answer, I'll assume the function definition should be `def func(n, k):` based on the given constraints.


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 9. 

Since the output description is missing, I'll provide a general outline based on the typical expectations for such a function, which might involve calculating or determining something based on `n` and `k`. However, without the specific output details, the exact functionality can't be precisely defined.


If we were to assume a common scenario where this function might be used (like calculating the number of digits in `n` that are equal to `k`, or finding the remainder when `n` is divided by `k`, or any other operation involving `n` and `k`), the description would follow the pattern of explaining what the function returns based on `n` and `k`. 

Given the lack of specific output information, let's consider a hypothetical scenario for demonstration purposes:


Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000 and k is an integer between 1 and 9, and returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**
