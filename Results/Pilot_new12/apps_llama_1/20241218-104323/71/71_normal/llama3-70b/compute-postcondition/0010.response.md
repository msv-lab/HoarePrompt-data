The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Initially, `n` is the input integer divided by 100 and must not be a multiple of 10. This implies that `n` can be represented as `n = input_integer / 100`, where `input_integer` is not a multiple of 1000 (since `n` is not a multiple of 10 after division by 100). 

After the update, `n` becomes `n = (input_integer / 100) // 10`, which simplifies to `n = input_integer / 1000`. The condition that `n` must not be a multiple of 10 after the initial division by 100 implies that `input_integer` is not a multiple of 1000, but after dividing by 1000, `n` could potentially be an integer if `input_integer` is a multiple of 1000 minus some factor that ensures it's not a multiple of 10 after the initial division by 100.

Since `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10, the new value of `n` will be the integer part of `n / 10`. Given that `n` was initially `input_integer / 100` and not a multiple of 10, the updated `n` will be an integer but with the condition adjusted according to its new value.

The state of `w` is not affected by the operation on `n`, so `w` remains increased by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer divided by 1000 and must not be a multiple of 10 after the initial division by 100, `w` is increased by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 1000, `w` is increased by 1 from its previous value**
