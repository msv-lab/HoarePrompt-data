Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it simply removes the last digit of the number `n` until it becomes divisible by `10^k`. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions.

For example, consider the input `n = 120` and `k = 2`. The program will remove the last digit `0` and then the remaining number `12` is still not divisible by `10^2`, so it will remove another digit, resulting in `w = 2`. However, the correct answer is `w = 1` because we can remove the digit `2` to get `10`, which is divisible by `10^2`.

The correct approach should involve finding all possible substrings of `n` that are divisible by `10^k` and then finding the minimum number of deletions required to get one of these substrings. The given program does not implement this approach and therefore does not work correctly for all potential cases.
