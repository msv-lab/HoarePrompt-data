Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if we consider the case where n = 10203049 and k = 2, we expect the output to be 3. However, the given program does not correctly solve this problem. It only removes digits from the end of the number n, which might not always lead to the minimum number of digits to erase to get a number divisible by 10^k.

In the given example, the optimal solution would be to remove the digits 1, 2, and 4, resulting in 30009 and then removing 3, 0, 0, 9 to get 0 which is divisible by 10^2, but the given program would not find this solution.

A correct solution would involve trying all possible combinations of digits and checking if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k, not just removing digits from the end of the number.

This program fails to consider all possible solutions and may not always find the minimum number of digits to erase. 

To solve this problem correctly, a more complex approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or recursion to try all possible combinations of digits. 

Here is a high-level explanation of what the correct solution would look like:
- Parse the input number into a string of digits.
- Use a recursive or dynamic programming approach to try all possible combinations of digits.
- For each combination, check if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k.
- Keep track of the minimum number of digits that need to be erased to get a number divisible by 10^k.

The given program does not implement this approach and therefore does not always find the correct solution.
