Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The problem asks to find the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number `n`, so that the result is divisible by `10^k`. However, the provided program only removes digits from the right (i.e., it performs integer division by 10), which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.

For example, if `n = 30020` and `k = 3`, the program will remove the 0s from the right until it gets a number that is divisible by `10^3`, which will be `3002`. However, this is not the optimal solution because we can remove only one digit (the 2) to get `3000`, which is divisible by `10^3`.

The correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of digits to remove and finding the combination that results in the fewest number of digits removed while still being divisible by `10^k`. 

The provided program does not handle this and therefore does not meet the problem description. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different approach, such as using dynamic programming or recursion to try all possible combinations of digits to remove and find the optimal solution. 

Here is a simple example of how the correct solution could look like in Python:

```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    target = '0' * k
    n = str(n)
    min removals = float('inf')
    
    def dfs(index, removals, current):
        nonlocal min_removals
        if index == len(n):
            if current!= '' and current[-k:] == target:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, removals)
            return
        
        dfs(index + 1, removals + 1, current)
        dfs(index + 1, removals, current + n[index])
    
    dfs(0, 0, '')
    return min_removals

# Example usage
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min_digits_to_remove(n, k))
```
