The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, 
`s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, 
`v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, 
`volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, 
`total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, 
`min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, 
`i` equals 1, 
we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
