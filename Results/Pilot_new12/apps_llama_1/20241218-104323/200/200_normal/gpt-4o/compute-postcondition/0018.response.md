Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, if `remaining_kvass` equals 0, then `i` equals 0, `volumes[i]` is greater than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, `possible_to_take` equals `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
