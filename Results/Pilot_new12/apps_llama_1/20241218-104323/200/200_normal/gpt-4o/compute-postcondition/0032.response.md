Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`. If `remaining_kvass` equals 0, the most internal loop is terminated. Otherwise, the loop continues with `remaining_kvass` updated to `remaining_kvass` - `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)` and `possible_to_take` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.**
