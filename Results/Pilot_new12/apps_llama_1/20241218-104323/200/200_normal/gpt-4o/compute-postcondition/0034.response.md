Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, and the current value of `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, indicating the target volume `s` could not be fully met due to volume constraints**
