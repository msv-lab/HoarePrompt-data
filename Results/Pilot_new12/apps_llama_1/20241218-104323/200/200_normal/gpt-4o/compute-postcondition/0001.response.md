The code line `volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new list of integers to the variable `volumes`. The input integers are obtained from the standard input, split by whitespace. 

The initial state variables `n`, `s`, and `v_i` are not affected by this line of code, as it introduces a new variable `volumes`. 

The value of `volumes` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, and `volumes` is a list of input integers**
