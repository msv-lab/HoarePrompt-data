The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`, which equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `i` is incremented by 1, `remaining_kvass` equals `remaining_kvass` - `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, `possible_to_take` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`**
