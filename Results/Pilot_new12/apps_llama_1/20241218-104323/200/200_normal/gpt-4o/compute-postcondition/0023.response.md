Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `i` equals 1, `volumes[i]` is greater than or equal to `min_keg_volume`. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)` and `remaining_kvass` equals `remaining_kvass - min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.**
