Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, and `total_volume` equals the sum of all elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, then the value -1 has been printed and returned at the output state. Otherwise, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` has been printed, and if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` equals `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and the value of `min_keg_volume` has been returned at the output state.***
