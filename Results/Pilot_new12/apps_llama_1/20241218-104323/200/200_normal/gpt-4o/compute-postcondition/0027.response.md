The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, the loop is not specified, but since `i` is incremented by 1, we assume it is being used in a loop.

Since `continue` does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same, with the exception that the next iteration of the loop will begin.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `i` is incremented by 1, `remaining_kvass` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
