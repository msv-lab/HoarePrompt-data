To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we analyze the given for loop statement and the provided program state before the loop starts. The loop statement is a simple `for` loop that iterates over a range defined by `n`. This means the loop's execution depends solely on the value of `n`.

Given state before the loop starts: 
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3.
- `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12.
- `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i.
- `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers.
- `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`.
- `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- `min_keg_volume` is equal to the smallest integer in `volumes`.
- `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the given condition that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3. 

Since `i` is the loop variable, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first value it will take in the loop, which is 0, considering the loop iterates over `range(n)`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to the smallest integer in `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, and `i` is 0**
