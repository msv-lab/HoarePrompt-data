To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we should analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a certain value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3
- `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12
- `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i
- `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers
- `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`
- `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`
- `remaining_kvass` is not equal to 0 (since we didn't break out of the loop)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` is in `range(n)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `i` is incremented by 1, `remaining_kvass` is not equal to 0**
