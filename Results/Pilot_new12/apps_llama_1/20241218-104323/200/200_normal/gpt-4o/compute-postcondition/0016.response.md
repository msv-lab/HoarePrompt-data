Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then `i` equals 0, otherwise `i` is 0, `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`. The current value of `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `s`, and the current value of `remaining_kvass` equals `s - min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, s)`. The current value of `remaining_kvass` is 0, meaning that `s` has been fully utilized, and `s` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, s)`**
