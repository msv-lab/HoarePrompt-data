The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no information about how the loop variables change in the loop body, the states of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `i` equals 1, `volumes[i]` is greater than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
