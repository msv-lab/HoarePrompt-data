To understand the impact of the `continue` statement, let's analyze its effect within a loop. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only, and then the loop continues with the next iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3,
- `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12,
- `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i,
- `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers,
- `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`,
- `min_keg_volume` is equal to the smallest integer in `volumes`,
- `remaining_kvass` is initially equal to `s`,
- `i` is 0,
- The current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables directly but rather controls the flow of the loop, the state of all variables remains unchanged. The loop will simply proceed to the next iteration, thus not affecting the values of `n`, `s`, `v_i`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` equals `s`, `i` equals 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
