Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`, and `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`**
