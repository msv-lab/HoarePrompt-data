Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the minimum keg volume required to distribute a target volume of kvass `s` among `n` kegs with different volumes `v_i`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^12, and `v_i` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. If the total volume of all kegs is less than the target volume `s`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it attempts to distribute the target volume `s` among the kegs, starting from the smallest keg, and returns the minimum keg volume required to meet or exceed the target volume. If the target volume cannot be fully met due to volume constraints, the function adjusts the minimum keg volume by subtracting the remaining volume divided among the kegs. The function performs input validation implicitly by handling cases where the total volume is less than the target volume, and it handles edge cases where the target volume is greater than the total volume of all kegs. The function returns an integer value representing the minimum keg volume required to distribute the target volume of kvass.**
