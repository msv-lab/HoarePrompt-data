Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` equals `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
