The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. The `possible_to_take` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, 
`s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, 
`v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, 
`volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, 
`total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to `s`, 
`min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, 
`i` equals 1, 
`volumes[i]` is greater than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, 
`possible_to_take` equals `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, 
`remaining_kvass` equals `remaining_kvass - min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.
