The values of `n` and `s` are updated with the input values. `n` becomes an input integer between 1 and 10^3, and `s` becomes an input integer between 1 and 10^12. The state of `v_i` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, and `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i**
