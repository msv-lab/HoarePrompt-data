Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It first checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the volume of kvass that Fair Nut wants to pour into his glass. If this condition is met, it prints -1, indicating that it's not possible to pour the desired volume.

If the total volume is sufficient, the program sorts the keg volumes in ascending order and initializes the minimum keg volume to the smallest keg. It then iterates through the kegs, starting from the smallest, and calculates how much kvass can be taken from each keg while keeping the minimum keg volume unchanged.

The program correctly handle the cases where the remaining kvass to be poured is greater than 0 after iterating through all kegs. In such cases, it updates the minimum keg volume by subtracting the remaining kvass divided by the number of kegs, rounded down to the nearest integer, plus the number of kegs minus 1, divided by the number of kegs. This ensures that the minimum keg volume is reduced as uniformly as possible across all kegs.

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and does not contain any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail. 

For instance, in the example "Input: 3 3, 4 3 5", the program will output "3", which is correct because Fair Nut can take 1 liter from the first keg and 2 liters from the third keg, leaving 3 liters in each keg. Similarly, in the example "Input: 3 7, 1 2 3", the program will output "-1", which is also correct because Fair Nut cannot pour 7 liters of kvass given the available keg volumes.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
