Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum volume of kvass in the least keg after pouring a glass of kvass by `s` liters. The program first checks if the total volume of kvass in all kegs is sufficient to pour the desired amount. If not, it prints `-1`.

If the total volume is sufficient, the program sorts the keg volumes in ascending order and initializes the minimum keg volume to the smallest keg volume. It then iterates over the kegs, attempting to pour as much kvass as possible from each keg while maintaining the minimum keg volume.

The program correctly handles cases where the remaining amount of kvass to pour is greater than the available amount in the current keg. In such cases, it pours the maximum possible amount from the current keg and continues with the next keg.

The program also correctly adjusts the minimum keg volume when there is still remaining kvass to pour after iterating over all kegs. In this case, it subtracts the remaining amount divided by the number of kegs from the minimum keg volume.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness, and a thorough analysis of the code reveals no potential cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness is verified.
