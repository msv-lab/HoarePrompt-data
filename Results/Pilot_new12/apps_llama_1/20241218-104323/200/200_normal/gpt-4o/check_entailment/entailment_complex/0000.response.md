Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, handling the number of kegs `n`, the target volume `s`, and the volumes of the kegs `v_i`.

2. **Total Volume Check**: The program checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the target volume `s`. If so, it prints `-1`, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

3. **Volume Distribution**: The program attempts to distribute the target volume `s` among the kegs, starting from the smallest keg. It uses a greedy approach, which is correct in this case because the goal is to minimize the remaining volume.

4. **Minimum Keg Volume Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum keg volume required to meet or exceed the target volume. If the target volume cannot be fully met due to volume constraints, the program adjusts the minimum keg volume by subtracting the remaining volume divided among the kegs.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target volume is greater than the total volume of all kegs.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all potential cases. The use of a greedy approach for volume distribution is correct, as it ensures that the minimum keg volume is achieved. The adjustment of the minimum keg volume when the target volume cannot be fully met is also correct, as it ensures that the remaining volume is distributed evenly among the kegs.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
