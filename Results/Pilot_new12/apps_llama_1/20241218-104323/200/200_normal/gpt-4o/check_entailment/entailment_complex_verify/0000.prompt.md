You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum volume of kvass in the least keg after pouring a glass of kvass by `s` liters. The program first checks if the total volume of kvass in all kegs is sufficient to pour the desired amount. If not, it prints `-1`.

If the total volume is sufficient, the program sorts the keg volumes in ascending order and initializes the minimum keg volume to the smallest keg volume. It then iterates over the kegs, attempting to pour as much kvass as possible from each keg while maintaining the minimum keg volume.

The program correctly handles cases where the remaining amount of kvass to pour is greater than the available amount in the current keg. In such cases, it pours the maximum possible amount from the current keg and continues with the next keg.

The program also correctly adjusts the minimum keg volume when there is still remaining kvass to pour after iterating over all kegs. In this case, it subtracts the remaining amount divided by the number of kegs from the minimum keg volume.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness, and a thorough analysis of the code reveals no potential cases where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness is verified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, s is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v_i is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals the smallest integer in `volumes`, and `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (indicating the target volume `s` was met or exceeded) or a value greater than 0 (indicating the target volume `s` could not be fully met due to volume constraints).
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, `total_volume` equals `sum(volumes)` and is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` equals `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an input integer between 1 and 10^12, `v_i` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, and `total_volume` equals the sum of all elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, then the value -1 has been printed and returned at the output state. Otherwise, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` has been printed, and if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` equals `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and the value of `min_keg_volume` has been returned at the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the minimum keg volume required to distribute a target volume of kvass `s` among `n` kegs with different volumes `v_i`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^12, and `v_i` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. If the total volume of all kegs is less than the target volume `s`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it attempts to distribute the target volume `s` among the kegs, starting from the smallest keg, and returns the minimum keg volume required to meet or exceed the target volume. If the target volume cannot be fully met due to volume constraints, the function adjusts the minimum keg volume by subtracting the remaining volume divided among the kegs. The function performs input validation implicitly by handling cases where the total volume is less than the target volume, and it handles edge cases where the target volume is greater than the total volume of all kegs. The function returns an integer value representing the minimum keg volume required to distribute the target volume of kvass.
