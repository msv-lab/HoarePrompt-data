Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to correctly solve the problem. It first sorts the kegs by volume and then performs a binary search to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in each keg after pouring out `s` liters.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program sorts the kegs by volume in ascending order using the `sort()` function. This is necessary to ensure that the binary search works correctly.
2. The program initializes the `low` and `high` variables to 0 and the minimum volume of the kegs, respectively. The `low` variable represents the minimum amount of kvass that can be left in each keg, and the `high` variable represents the maximum amount.
3. The program performs a binary search to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in each keg. The binary search iteratively calculates the midpoint `mid` and checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured out without leaving less than `mid` liters in each keg is less than `s`. If it is, the program sets `low` to `mid`. Otherwise, it sets `high` to `mid - 1`.
4. After the binary search, the program checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured out without leaving less than `low` liters in each keg is equal to `s`. If it is, the program prints `low`. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly. For example, if the total volume of the kegs is less than `s`, the program will correctly print -1. If the total volume of the kegs is greater than or equal to `s`, the program will correctly find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in each keg after pouring out `s` liters.

I couldn't find any cases where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
