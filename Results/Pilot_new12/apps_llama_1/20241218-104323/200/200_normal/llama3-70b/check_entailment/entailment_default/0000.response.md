Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the desired functionality as per the problem description. It attempts to find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring s liters into a glass. The function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum remaining volume.

Here's a breakdown of why the code seems correct:

1.  The function sorts the list of volumes `v` in ascending order, which allows it to focus on the keg with the least kvass.
2.  It then uses a binary search to find the maximum remaining volume. The search range is initialized to `[0, min(v)]`, where `min(v)` is the volume of the keg with the least kvass.
3.  Within the binary search loop, the function calculates the total volume that can be poured by taking `mid` liters from each keg, where `mid` is the current midpoint of the search range. This is done using the expression `sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))`.
4.  If the total volume that can be poured is less than the target volume `s`, the function updates the lower bound of the search range to `mid`. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound to `mid - 1`.
5.  Once the binary search loop terminates, the function checks if the total volume that can be poured at the current `low` value is equal to the target volume `s`. If it is, the function prints the `low` value, which represents the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass. Otherwise, it prints -1 to indicate that it's not possible to pour exactly `s` liters.

The provided examples and output hints agree with the code's behavior, and the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly. The function assumes that the input values are valid, which is in line with the problem description's constraints. Therefore, based on the analysis, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
