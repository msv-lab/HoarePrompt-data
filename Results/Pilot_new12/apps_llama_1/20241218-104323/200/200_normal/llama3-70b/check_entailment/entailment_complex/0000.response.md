Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and always does what it asks for. Here's why:

1. The program sorts the list of keg volumes in ascending order, which allows it to easily find the minimum volume.
2. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass. The search range is from 0 to the minimum volume.
3. The binary search iteratively checks if the sum of the minimum of the current search value and each keg volume is less than the target sum `s`. If it is, the search value is increased; otherwise, it is decreased.
4. Once the binary search is complete, the program checks if the sum of the minimum of the final search value and each keg volume is equal to the target sum `s`. If it is, the program prints the final search value; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly handles all cases:

* If the sum of the volumes of all kegs is less than `s`, the program will print -1.
* If the sum of the volumes of all kegs is greater than or equal to `s`, the program will find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass and print it.

The program assumes that the input values are valid, which is stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not need to handle invalid input cases, such as empty lists or negative numbers.

In summary, the program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring `s` liters into a glass, and it handles all cases as described in the problem description.
