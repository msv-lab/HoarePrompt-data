Correctness: **True**

The given code is a correct implementation of the problem description. The code attempts to find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring s liters into a glass. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum remaining volume. 

The code first sorts the list of volumes in ascending order. Then, it performs a binary search between the minimum volume (0) and the minimum volume of the kegs. In each iteration of the binary search, it calculates the total volume of kvass that can be poured from the kegs if the current remaining volume in the least keg is mid. If the total volume is less than s, it updates the low bound of the binary search to mid. Otherwise, it updates the high bound to mid - 1. 

After the binary search, it checks if the total volume of kvass that can be poured from the kegs if the remaining volume in the least keg is low is equal to s. If it is, it prints the low value as the maximum remaining volume in the least keg. Otherwise, it prints -1 to indicate that it is not possible to pour exactly s liters of kvass.

The code handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the sum of the volumes of all kegs is less than or equal to s, as well as cases where the sum of the volumes of all kegs is greater than s. It also handles the cases where the input values are within the specified ranges correctly.

For example, for the input 
```
3 3
4 3 5
```
The code correctly outputs 3, because the Fair Nut can take 1 liter from the first keg and 2 liters from the third keg, and there will be 3 liters of kvass in each of the first and third kegs, and 2 liters in the second keg, but since we want the maximum amount of kvass in the least keg after pouring into the glass, the answer is indeed 3.

For the input
```
3 4
5 3 4
```
The code correctly outputs 2, because the Fair Nut can take 3 liters from the first keg and 1 liter from the second keg, and there will be 2 liters of kvass in the second keg, which is the least keg after pouring into the glass.

For the input
```
3 7
1 2 3
```
The code correctly outputs -1, because it is not possible to pour 7 liters of kvass from the kegs. 

The code is correct because it correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
