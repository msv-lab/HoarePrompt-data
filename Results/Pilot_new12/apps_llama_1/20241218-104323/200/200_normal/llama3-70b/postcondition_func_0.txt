The function accepts parameters n, s, and a list of volumes v_i, and attempts to find the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring s liters into a glass. It checks if it is possible to pour exactly s liters by taking a portion of the volume from each keg, and returns the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass if possible. If it is not possible to pour exactly s liters, the function returns -1. The function assumes that the input values are valid, i.e., n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), s is an integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), and v_i (1 <= i <= n) are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function handles cases where the sum of the volumes of all kegs is less than or equal to s, as well as cases where the sum of the volumes of all kegs is greater than s. The function does not handle cases where the input values are invalid or where the list of volumes is empty.
