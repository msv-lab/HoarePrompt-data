The code `v.sort()` sorts the list `v` in ascending order. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected. The list `v` now contains the same `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), but in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order**
