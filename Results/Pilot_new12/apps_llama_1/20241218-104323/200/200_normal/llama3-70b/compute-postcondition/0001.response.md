Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code:

- The initial state specifies that `n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), and `v_i` (1 <= i <= n) are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads input from the user, splits it into a list of strings (splitting at whitespace), converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `v`.
- The variables `n` and `s` are not modified by this code. Their values remain the same.
- The variable `v_i` is related to the input and is essentially overwritten by the input, which is converted into a list of integers and assigned to `v`.
- Since `v` is now a list of integers based on the user's input, the length of `v` should be equal to `n` (as per the initial state's implication that there are `n` integers `v_i`), assuming the input matches the expected format and number of values.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), as input by the user**
