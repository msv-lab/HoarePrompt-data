The provided code snippet `n, s = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `s` based on user input. However, the initial state already specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive) and `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive). The update does not change the range of values these variables can hold, but rather assigns them specific values within those ranges based on the input.

Given that the code does not provide specific values for `n` and `s` but rather reads them from the input, we can infer that `n` and `s` will take on integer values within their specified ranges. The volumes of the kegs `v_i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state after running this code is that `n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), and `v_i` (1 <= i <= n) are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), representing the volumes of n kegs of kvass.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v_i` (1 <= i <= n) are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**
