The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `s`, and `v_i` (where 1 <= i <= n). `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), and `v_i` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the volumes of n kegs of kvass. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring s liters into a glass.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, s, and a list of volumes v_i, and returns the maximum remaining volume in the keg with the least kvass after pouring s liters into a glass.**
