Postcondition: **`low` equals `high`, `n` is the original number of elements in `v`, `s` is the original target sum, `v` is the original list of integers, and `mid` equals `low` (or `high`), which is the largest possible value such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v` is less than `s`. The current value of the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`.**
