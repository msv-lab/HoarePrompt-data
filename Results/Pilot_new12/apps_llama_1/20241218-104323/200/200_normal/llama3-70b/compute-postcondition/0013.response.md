The value of `mid` is assigned as the average of `low` and `high` rounded up to the nearest integer, given by the expression `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` remains a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), and `v` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is either less than `s` or greater than or equal to `s`.**
