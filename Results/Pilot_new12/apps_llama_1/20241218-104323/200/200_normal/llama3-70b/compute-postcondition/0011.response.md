Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is `(v[0] + 1) // 2` and `high` is `v[0]`. Otherwise, `low` is 0 and `high` is `((v[0] + 1) // 2) - 1`. In both cases, `mid` is `(v[0] + 1) // 2`, and `total` is `n` if `v[0]` equals 1, otherwise `total` is `n * ((v[0] + 1) // 2)`, with `total` being either less than `s` or greater than or equal to `s` respectively.***
