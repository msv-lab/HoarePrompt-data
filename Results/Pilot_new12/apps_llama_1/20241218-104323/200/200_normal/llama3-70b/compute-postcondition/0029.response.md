Postcondition: ***`low` equals `high`, `n` is the original number of elements in `v`, `s` is the original target sum, `v` is the original list of integers, and `mid` equals `low` (or `high`). If the sum of `min(low, x)` for all `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, the function returns and prints -1. Otherwise, `low` equals `high` has been printed, and the sum of `min(low, x)` for all `x` in `v` equals `s`.***
