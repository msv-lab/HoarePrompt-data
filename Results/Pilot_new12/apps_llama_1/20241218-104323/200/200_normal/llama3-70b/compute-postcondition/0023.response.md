Postcondition: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, where `mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum of the original `mid` and each element `x` in `v`.**
