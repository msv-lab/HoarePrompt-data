Postcondition: **`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order. The current value of `low` is 0, the current value of `high` is `v[0]`, the current value of `mid` is `(v[0] + 1) // 2`. The current value of `total` is `n` if `v[0]` equals 1, otherwise the current value of `total` is `n * ((v[0] + 1) // 2)`. The total is less than `s`.**
