Postcondition: ***`n` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `s` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^12 (inclusive), `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), in ascending order. If `total` (the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`) is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, which is now `(mid + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` remains the sum of `min((low + high + 1) // 2, x)` for all `x` in `v`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `total` remains the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`.***
