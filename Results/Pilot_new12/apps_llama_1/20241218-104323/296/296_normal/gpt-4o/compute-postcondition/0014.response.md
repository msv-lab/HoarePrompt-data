Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `divisors` is the previous list with `i` and `n // i` appended to it, otherwise, `i` is the previous `i` plus one and `divisors` remains the previous list with `i` appended to it**
