Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the current value of `divisors` is an empty list, meaning `n` has no divisors less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.**
