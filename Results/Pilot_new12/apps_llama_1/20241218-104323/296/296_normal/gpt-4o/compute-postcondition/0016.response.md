According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, and `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 (as it's the next iteration), and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `divisors` may or may not have been updated in the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`**
