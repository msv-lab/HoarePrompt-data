To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet within the context of the provided initial state.

The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9`, and `n` is greater than 2. This implies `n` can be any integer from 3 to `10^9`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
divisors = []
```
This line of code initializes an empty list named `divisors`. It does not modify the value of `n` or any other existing variable; it simply creates a new variable named `divisors` and assigns it an empty list as its value.

Therefore, after executing this code, the state of `n` remains unchanged, and a new variable `divisors` is introduced with an empty list as its value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, and `divisors` is an empty list `[]`.**
