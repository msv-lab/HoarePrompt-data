The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9` and `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `n // i` will be the integer division of `n` by the updated `i`, which is appended to the `divisors` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `divisors` is the previous list with `i` and `n // i` appended to it**.
