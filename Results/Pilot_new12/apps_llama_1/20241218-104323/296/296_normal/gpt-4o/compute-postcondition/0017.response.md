The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The previous values of `n` and the fact that `i` is the previous `i` plus one, and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n` are not affected. The state of `n` remains the same, `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`. `i` remains the previous `i` plus one. The only change is in the `divisors` list, which now includes the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `divisors` includes the current value of `i`, and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`**
