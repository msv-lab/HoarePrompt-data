To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop and the conditions provided.

Given loop: `for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):`

1. **Range of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 2` and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(n))` (inclusive).
2. **Condition for `n`**: `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`.
3. **Divisibility condition**: If `n` is divisible by `i`, then specific actions are taken (though the specifics of these actions are not detailed, they imply changes based on divisibility).
4. **State of `divisors`**: If `i` is not equal to `n` divided by `i`, then `divisors` contains at least `[2, n // i]`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the state of variables remains unchanged.

Given the end state of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`.
- `i` is an integer that started at 2.
- The conditions around `n`'s divisibility by `i` and the state of `divisors` are as described.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, meaning `i` can be incremented.
- Since the loop increment is implicit in the `range` function, `i` will automatically be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains unchanged as there's no indication from the loop or conditions that `n` would change.
- The condition around `divisors` would potentially update if `n` is divisible by the new `i`, but since we're only considering the start of the next iteration without executing the loop body, we focus on `i`'s increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, and any other variables' states (`divisors`, etc.) would be as they were at the end of the previous iteration, ready for potential update based on the new `i` value.**
