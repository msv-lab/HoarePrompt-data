The program returns a string that starts with 'YES' and a newline character, followed by the number of elements in the `divisors` list, which contains all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots, and this number is denoted as `k`. 

Then, it is followed by a newline character and the string representations of all fractions in the `fractions` list, where each fraction is a tuple of two elements: the numerator is always 1, and the denominator is a divisor from the `divisors` list, and these string representations are separated by newline characters.

Output State: **The program returns a string that starts with 'YES' and a newline character, followed by the number of elements in the `divisors` list, then a newline character, and then the string representations of all fractions in the `fractions` list, with each fraction having a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n` less than or equal to its square root, along with its corresponding divisor greater than the square root of `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.**
