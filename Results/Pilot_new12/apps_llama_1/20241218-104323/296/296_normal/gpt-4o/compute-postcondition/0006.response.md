The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Since `i` is 2, `divisors` becomes `[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `divisors` is a list containing the value 2, `[2]`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `divisors` is `[2]`, `i` is 2**
