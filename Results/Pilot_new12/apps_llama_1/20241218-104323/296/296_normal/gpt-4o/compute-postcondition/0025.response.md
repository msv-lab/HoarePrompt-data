The value of `k` is assigned the length of the `divisors` list, which contains all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots, and `divisors` is not empty, and `k` is the number of elements in the `divisors` list**
