The code creates a new list `fractions` that contains tuples of the form `(1, d)`, where `d` is each divisor in the `divisors` list. The values of the other variables are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots, and `divisors` is not empty, `k` is the number of elements in the `divisors` list, and `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(1, d)` with `d` being a divisor in `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots, and `divisors` is not empty, `k` is the number of elements in the `divisors` list, and `fractions` is `[(1, d) for d in divisors]`**
