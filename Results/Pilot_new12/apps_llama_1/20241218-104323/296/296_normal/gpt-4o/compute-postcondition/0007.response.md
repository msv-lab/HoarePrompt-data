Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `divisors` is initially `[2]`, the current value of `divisors` is a list that started with 2, `i` is initially 2, the current value of `i` is an integer that started at 2, and the current value of `i` is not equal to `n` divided by `i`**
