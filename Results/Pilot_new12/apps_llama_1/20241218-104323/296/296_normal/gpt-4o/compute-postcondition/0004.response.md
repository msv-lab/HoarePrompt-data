To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions that must be met before the loop starts. 

The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the square root of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, because the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value if it's not an integer or if the step is not 1, but in this case, since we add 1 to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, it will include the square root of `n` if it's an integer. However, for the loop to start, `n` must be at least 4, because the square root of any number less than 4 (but greater than 1) will be less than 2, meaning the loop won't execute.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `3 <= n <= 10^9`, we can see that the condition for `n` to enable the loop to run is already partially met. However, we need `n` to be at least 4 for the loop to actually iterate, given its current setup. 

Also, `i` is the variable that will take on the values in the specified range. Before the loop starts, `i` has no value yet in the context of this loop, so we can initialize it as 2, which will be its value at the start of the first iteration.

`divisors` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as the loop's range depends solely on `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `divisors` is an empty list `[]`, and `i` is 2**
