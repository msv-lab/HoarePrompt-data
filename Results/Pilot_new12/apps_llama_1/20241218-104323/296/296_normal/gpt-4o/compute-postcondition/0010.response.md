Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is an integer that started at 2. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is an integer that started at 2. If `i` is not equal to `n` divided by `i`, then `divisors` is a list that contains at least `[2, n // i]`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
