The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following cases: 
Case_1: The program returns the string 'NO'. 
Case_2: The program returns 'NO'. 
Case_3: The program returns a string that starts with 'YES' and a newline character, followed by the number of elements in the `divisors` list, then a newline character, and then the string representations of all fractions in the `fractions` list. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 'NO' or a string that starts with 'YES' and includes the number and string representations of specific fractions based on the divisors of `n`.
