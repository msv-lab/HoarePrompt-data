The code appending `n // i` to the `divisors` list affects the state of the `divisors` list. The value of `n // i` is calculated based on the current values of `n` and `i`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9` and `i` is an integer that started at 2 and is not equal to `n` divided by `i`, the value of `n // i` is a positive integer less than `n`. The `divisors` list, which initially contained `[2]`, now contains `[2, n // i]`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `divisors` is a list that contains `[2, n // i]`, `i` is an integer that started at 2 and is not equal to `n` divided by `i`**
