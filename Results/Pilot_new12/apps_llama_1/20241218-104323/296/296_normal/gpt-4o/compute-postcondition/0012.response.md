The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`. The value of `i` is also unchanged by this line of code, it is still the previous `i` plus one. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `divisors` is the previous list with `i` appended to it**
