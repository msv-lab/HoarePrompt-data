To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer within the range `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one, `divisors` includes the current value of `i`, and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. The code `divisors.append(n // i)` adds the integer division of `n` by `i` to the list `divisors`.

Given the constraint that `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, we know `i` is within the range `1 <= i <= sqrt(n)`. Since `i` is the previous `i` plus one, and it is a part of the condition that it must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`, we understand that `i` is incrementing but always within this bound.

When `divisors.append(n // i)` is executed, it adds the result of the integer division of `n` by `i` to the `divisors` list. This operation does not change the value of `n` or `i` but modifies the `divisors` list by adding a new element that is a divisor of `n`.

Therefore, after the execution of the given code, the state of the program is updated such that `divisors` now includes an additional element which is the result of `n // i`, `n` remains a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, and `i` remains the previous `i` plus one but still less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is the previous `i` plus one and less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `divisors` includes the current value of `i` and `n // i`**
