To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

1. The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
2. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`.
3. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list. Additionally, if `i` is not equal to `n // i` (which means `i` is not the square root of `n`), it also appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list.

Given these operations, we can deduce the final state of the variables after the loop completes:

- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as its value is only used for comparisons and calculations but is not modified.
- `i` will have iterated over all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` by the time the loop finishes. Its final value will be the last number in this range, which is `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
- `divisors` will contain all divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, along with their corresponding pairs (if any) that are greater than the square root of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, its square root will be included only once in the `divisors` list.

Considering the initial state and the operations performed, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.**
