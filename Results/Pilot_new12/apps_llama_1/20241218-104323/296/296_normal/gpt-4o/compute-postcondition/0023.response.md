To solve the problem based on the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet, let's consider the details step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer with `3 <= n <= 10^9`.
   - `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which means `i` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.
   - `divisors` is an empty list. This implies that no divisors of `n` (less than or equal to the square root of `n` and their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots) have been found or added to the list.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The given code simply returns the string `'NO'`, without modifying the state of `n`, `i`, or `divisors`.
   - The return statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `i`, or `divisors`, meaning it does not use the information about `n` being a positive integer within a certain range, the value of `i` as the integer square root of `n`, or the emptiness of the `divisors` list.

3. **Calculation and Result**:
   - Given that the code returns a fixed string `'NO'` regardless of the initial state variables, the output does not change based on the values of `n`, `i`, or the state of `divisors`.
   - The program returns the string `'NO'`, which can be interpreted in the context of the initial state as indicating that no divisors (or certain conditions related to divisors) were found for `n`. However, this interpretation is based on the context and not directly from the return statement itself.

Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**
