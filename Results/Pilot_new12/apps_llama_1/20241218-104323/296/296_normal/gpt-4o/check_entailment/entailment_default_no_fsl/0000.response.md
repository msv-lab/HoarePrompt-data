Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. It correctly identifies the divisors of the given number `n` and generates fractions with numerator 1 and denominators as the divisors. However, it does not check if the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n` as required by the problem description.

For example, when `n = 6`, the code correctly outputs:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 3
```
However, this is coincidental. The code does not actually check if the sum of the fractions `1/2` and `1/3` equals `1 - 1/6`. It simply generates fractions with numerator 1 and denominators as the divisors.

For a counterexample, consider `n = 4`. The code will output:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 4
```
However, the sum of the fractions `1/2` and `1/4` is `3/4`, not `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. Although in this case the output seems correct, the code does not actually check if the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

To fix this, the code should calculate the sum of the fractions and check if it equals `1 - 1/n`. If not, it should try different combinations of divisors and numerators to find a sequence of fractions that satisfies the condition. The current implementation does not do this, so it is incorrect.
