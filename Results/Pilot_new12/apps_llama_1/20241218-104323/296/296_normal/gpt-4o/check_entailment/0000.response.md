Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, it returns a sequence of fractions with numerator 1 and denominator as each divisor. However, this does not guarantee that the sum of the fractions will be equal to 1 - 1/n.

For example, when the input is 6, the program correctly returns a sequence of fractions 1/2 and 1/3, which sums up to 1 - 1/6. However, when the input is 4, the program returns a sequence of fractions 1/2 and 1/4, which sums up to 3/4, not 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. But actually 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 which is equal to 1 - 1/4. But this is just a coincidence and the program does not work correctly for all inputs. 

For instance, when the input is 9, the program returns a sequence of fractions 1/3, which does not sum up to 1 - 1/9 = 8/9. This is because the program does not consider all possible combinations of fractions that could add up to the target sum. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not work for all possible inputs.
