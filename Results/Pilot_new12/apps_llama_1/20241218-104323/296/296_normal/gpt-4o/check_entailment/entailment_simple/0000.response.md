Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. According to the problem description, the program needs to find a sequence of fractions `a_i/b_i` such that the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`, where `b_i` divides `n` and `1 < b_i < n`. However, the program only generates fractions with a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n`. 

The main issue with the program is that it does not check whether the sum of the generated fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. In fact, the sum of the generated fractions will usually exceed `1 - 1/n` because all the numerators are 1.

For example, if `n = 6`, the program will output `YES` and the fractions `1/2` and `1/3`. While `1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6`, which is equal to `1 - 1/6`, this is just a coincidence. For most values of `n`, the sum of the generated fractions will not equal `1 - 1/n`.

To fix the program, it needs to be modified to generate fractions with numerators less than the denominator and to ensure that the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. 

Here's an example of how the program could be modified:

```python
import math

def find_fractions(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return None
    
    # Find all divisors of n
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    
    if not divisors:
        return None
    
    # Initialize the result and the remaining sum
    result = []
    remaining_sum = 1 - 1/n
    
    # Try to find a sequence of fractions with the desired sum
    for divisor in divisors:
        for numerator in range(1, divisor):
            fraction = numerator / divisor
            if fraction <= remaining_sum:
                result.append((numerator, divisor))
                remaining_sum -= fraction
                if remaining_sum == 0:
                    return result
    
    return None

n = int(input().strip())
fractions = find_fractions(n)

if fractions is None:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')
    print(len(fractions))
    for numerator, denominator in fractions:
        print(numerator, denominator)
```

In this modified program, we try to find a sequence of fractions with the desired sum by iterating over all divisors of `n` and all possible numerators less than the divisor. If we find a fraction that does not exceed the remaining sum, we add it to the result and subtract it from the remaining sum. If the remaining sum becomes zero, we return the result. If we cannot find a sequence of fractions with the desired sum, we return `None`.
