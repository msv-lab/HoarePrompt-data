Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks for divisors of the input number `n` and constructs fractions with numerator 1 and denominator as the divisor. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will always equal `1 - 1/n`.

A simple counterexample is when `n = 5`. The program will output `YES` with the fraction `1/2` and `1/5` (if it considers 5 as a divisor), but the sum of these fractions does not equal `1 - 1/5`.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself. In such cases, the program should return `NO` because it's impossible to construct a sequence of fractions with the required properties.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle all potential cases and ensure that the sum of the constructed fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. This might involve using a different approach to generate the sequence of fractions or adding additional checks to handle edge cases.
