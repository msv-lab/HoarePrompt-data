Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`, where `n` is a given positive integer. The code, however, simply generates all divisors of `n` and creates fractions with a numerator of 1 for each divisor. It then returns these fractions without checking if their sum equals `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the code returns `YES` with fractions `1/2` and `1/3`, which correctly sum up to `1 - 1/6`. However, this is not a general solution and does not work for all cases. 

A counterexample can be seen when `n = 4`. The code will return `YES` with the fraction `1/2`, but the sum of this fraction is not equal to `1 - 1/4`. 

The code does not correctly check if the sum of the generated fractions equals `1 - 1/n`, and it does not provide a general solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
