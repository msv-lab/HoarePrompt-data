You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks for divisors of the input number `n` and constructs fractions with numerator 1 and denominator as the divisor. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will always equal `1 - 1/n`.

A simple counterexample is when `n = 5`. The program will output `YES` with the fraction `1/2` and `1/5` (if it considers 5 as a divisor), but the sum of these fractions does not equal `1 - 1/5`.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself. In such cases, the program should return `NO` because it's impossible to construct a sequence of fractions with the required properties.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle all potential cases and ensure that the sum of the constructed fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. This might involve using a different approach to generate the sequence of fractions or adding additional checks to handle edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is greater than 2
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots, and `divisors` is not empty
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string that starts with 'YES' and a newline character, followed by the number of elements in the `divisors` list, then a newline character, and then the string representations of all fractions in the `fractions` list, with each fraction having a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n` less than or equal to its square root, along with its corresponding divisor greater than the square root of `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
