    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that `3 <= n <= 10^9`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, and `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of the original value of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of the original `n`, along with their corresponding divisors greater than the square root of the original `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.

    #The program returns a string that starts with 'YES' and a newline character, followed by the number of elements in the `divisors` list, then a newline character, and then the string representations of all fractions in the `fractions` list, with each fraction having a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n` less than or equal to its square root, along with its corresponding divisor greater than the square root of `n`, without duplicates for perfect square roots.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a string indicating whether `n` is a prime number or not. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` has divisors other than 1 and itself, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors, and then the string representations of fractions with a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n`. The function effectively identifies whether a given number is prime or composite, and for composite numbers, provides information about their divisors. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, as this is not specified in the provided code. Additionally, the function does not account for potential edge cases such as very large input numbers that may exceed the maximum limit of the `math.sqrt` function or the list `divisors`. However, based on the provided code, the function will still execute and return the correct result for such cases, albeit potentially with performance issues.
