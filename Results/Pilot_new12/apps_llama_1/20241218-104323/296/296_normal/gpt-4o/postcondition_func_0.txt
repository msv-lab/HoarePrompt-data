The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a string indicating whether `n` is a prime number or not. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` has divisors other than 1 and itself, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors, and then the string representations of fractions with a numerator of 1 and a denominator that is a divisor of `n`. The function effectively identifies whether a given number is prime or composite, and for composite numbers, provides information about their divisors. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, as this is not specified in the provided code. Additionally, the function does not account for potential edge cases such as very large input numbers that may exceed the maximum limit of the `math.sqrt` function or the list `divisors`. However, based on the provided code, the function will still execute and return the correct result for such cases, albeit potentially with performance issues.
