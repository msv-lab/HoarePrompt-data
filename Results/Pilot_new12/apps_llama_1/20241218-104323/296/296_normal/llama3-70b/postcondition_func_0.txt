The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. For any other `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then two lines containing '1' and a number: the first line contains `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2), and the second line contains `n` itself. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None), and its primary action is to print specific output based on the input `n`. The function does not handle cases where the input `n` is not a positive integer within the specified range or is not a valid integer, which could lead to errors if such inputs are provided.
