Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. It only checks if the input `n` is 2 and prints "NO" in that case. For other values of `n`, it prints "YES" and two fractions `1/n/2` and `1/n`, but it does not verify whether these fractions satisfy the condition `1/n + 1/n = 1 - 1/n`.

The problem description requires finding a sequence of fractions `a_i/b_i` such that:

1. `b_i` divides `n`,
2. `1 < b_i < n`,
3. `1 <= a_i < b_i`,
4. The sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

The given program does not ensure that these conditions are met. Specifically, it does not check whether `n/2` divides `n` for all `n`, and it does not verify whether the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 5`, the program prints "YES" and the fractions `1 2` and `1 5`. However, `2` does not divide `5`, so the first condition is not met.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should find a sequence of fractions that satisfy all the conditions specified in the problem description. The given program does not do this and therefore is not correct.
