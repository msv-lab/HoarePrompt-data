Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It only works for a limited set of cases, and it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.

One potential case that the program does not handle is when `n` is an odd number greater than 2. In this case, the program will still print 'YES' and then print two fractions, but these fractions may not satisfy the given equation.

For example, if `n` is 5, the program will print:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

However, the sum of these two fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for this case.

Additionally, the program does not generate the correct sequence of fractions for many cases. It simply prints two fractions with denominators `n//2` and `n`, which may not satisfy the given equation.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as finding all possible divisors of `n` and then constructing a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The given program does not provide such an approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
