Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. 

For example, when the input is $n = 3$, the program prints 'YES' and then prints two fractions: $\frac{1}{1}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$. However, $\frac{1}{1}$ is not a valid fraction in this case because its denominator is $1$, which does not divide $n = 3$ and also $1< b_i < n$ is not satisfied here as $1$ is not less than $3$. 

Moreover, the sum of these fractions is $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$, which is not equal to $1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

To make the program correct, we would need to implement the correct logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$, as described in the problem description. 

One way to solve this problem is to find all the factors of $n$ and try to find a combination of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. However, the given program does not implement this logic correctly. 

Another issue with the program is that it always prints two fractions, regardless of the value of $n$. However, the problem description states that the sequence can have any length $k$, not just $2$. 

Therefore, the program needs to be significantly modified to correctly implement the logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$.
