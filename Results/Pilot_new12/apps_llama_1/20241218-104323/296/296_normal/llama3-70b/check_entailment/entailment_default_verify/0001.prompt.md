You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. 

For example, when the input is $n = 3$, the program prints 'YES' and then prints two fractions: $\frac{1}{1}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$. However, $\frac{1}{1}$ is not a valid fraction in this case because its denominator is $1$, which does not divide $n = 3$ and also $1< b_i < n$ is not satisfied here as $1$ is not less than $3$. 

Moreover, the sum of these fractions is $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$, which is not equal to $1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

To make the program correct, we would need to implement the correct logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$, as described in the problem description. 

One way to solve this problem is to find all the factors of $n$ and try to find a combination of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. However, the given program does not implement this logic correctly. 

Another issue with the program is that it always prints two fractions, regardless of the value of $n$. However, the problem description states that the sequence can have any length $k$, not just $2$. 

Therefore, the program needs to be significantly modified to correctly implement the logic to find a sequence of fractions that sum to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. For any other `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then two lines containing '1' and a number: the first line contains `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2), and the second line contains `n` itself. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None), and its primary action is to print specific output based on the input `n`. The function does not handle cases where the input `n` is not a positive integer within the specified range or is not a valid integer, which could lead to errors if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
