Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. It only handles the cases where `n` is 2 or where `n` is greater than 2, but it does not ensure that the fractions printed satisfy the condition `1 <= a_i < b_i` and `b_i divides n`. Specifically, when printing the two fractions, it uses `n // 2` and `n` as the denominators, but it does not guarantee that `n // 2` is a divisor of `n` or that `n` is used correctly in the context of the problem.

In the given code, for any `n` greater than 2, it prints "YES", followed by 2, and then two lines containing '1' and a number: the first line contains `n // 2`, and the second line contains `n`. However, this approach does not satisfy the problem's condition that the sum of the fractions should equal `1 - 1/n`. For example, for `n = 5`, the code prints "YES", followed by `n // 2 = 2` and then `n = 5`, which results in the fractions `1/2` and `1/5`. The sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which does not equal `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
