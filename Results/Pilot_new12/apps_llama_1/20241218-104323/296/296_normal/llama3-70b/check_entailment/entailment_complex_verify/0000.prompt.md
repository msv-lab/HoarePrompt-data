You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It only works for a limited set of cases, and it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.

One potential case that the program does not handle is when `n` is an odd number greater than 2. In this case, the program will still print 'YES' and then print two fractions, but these fractions may not satisfy the given equation.

For example, if `n` is 5, the program will print:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

However, the sum of these two fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for this case.

Additionally, the program does not generate the correct sequence of fractions for many cases. It simply prints two fractions with denominators `n//2` and `n`, which may not satisfy the given equation.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as finding all possible divisors of `n` and then constructing a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The given program does not provide such an approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, if `n` is 2, then 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 2, 2 has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, `n // 2` has been printed, and '1' and the value of `n` have been printed, and `n` is not equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 10^9. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. For any other `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then two lines containing '1' and a number: the first line contains `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2), and the second line contains `n` itself. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None), and its primary action is to print specific output based on the input `n`. The function does not handle cases where the input `n` is not a positive integer within the specified range or is not a valid integer, which could lead to errors if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
