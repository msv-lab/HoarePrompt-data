Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program prints 'YES' for all inputs except when `n` is 2. However, it does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The problem description requires that the denominators `b_i` divide `n`, `1 < b_i < n`, and `1 <= a_i < b_i`.

2. The program only prints two fractions: `1/(n/2)` and `1/n`. However, `1/(n/2)` is equivalent to `2/n`, which does not satisfy the condition `1 <= a_i < b_i` because `a_i` (2) is not less than `b_i` (n) in this case. Also, `n/2` may not be an integer, which means it's not a valid denominator.

3. The program does not correctly calculate the sum of the fractions. The sum of `1/(n/2)` and `1/n` is `2/n + 1/n = 3/n`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/n` as required by the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to find a sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions and sum up to `1 - 1/n`. This may involve finding the factors of `n` and constructing the sequence of fractions accordingly. The provided program does not do this and therefore does not follow the problem description. 

Here's a simple example where the program fails: for `n = 6`, the program prints `1/3` and `1/6`, which sum up to `1/2`, not `1 - 1/6 = 5/6`. The correct sequence of fractions for `n = 6` is `1/2` and `1/3`, as shown in the problem description.
