Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The given program only checks if the input number `n` is equal to 2, and if not, it prints 'YES' followed by two fractions: `1/n // 2` and `1/n`. However, the problem description requires that the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. 

The program does not correctly calculate the fractions to sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The example given in the problem description where `n = 6` is a correct sequence of fractions (`1/2 + 1/3 = 1 - 1/6`), but the program does not correctly generate this sequence.

For example, when `n = 3`, the program will output:
```
YES
2
1 1
1 3
```
But the sum of these fractions is `1/1 + 1/3 = 4/3`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/3 = 2/3`. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case. 

Another case is when `n = 5`, the program will output:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```
But the sum of these fractions is `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. 

The correct approach should involve finding the correct sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n` for every `n`.
