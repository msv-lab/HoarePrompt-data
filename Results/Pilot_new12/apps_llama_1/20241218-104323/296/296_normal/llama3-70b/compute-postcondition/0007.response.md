The code prints the string '1' and the integer result of `n` divided by 2. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed. 'YES' has been printed, and 2 has been printed. 
The state of `n` is still an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2. The state of `k` is still 2. 
'1' and `n // 2` have been printed in addition to 'YES' and 2.

Output State: **'YES' has been printed, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 2 has been printed, '1' has been printed, and `n // 2` has been printed**
