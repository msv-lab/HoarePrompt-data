The function `func` does not accept any parameters. 

However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems that there should be a parameter `n` which is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. 

Since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the return value of the function. 

However, if we were to assume that the function is supposed to take an integer `n` as input, the functionality of the function would be to accept a positive integer `n` and return a value based on `n`. 

Since there are no output details, we cannot provide the exact functionality. 

If we were to provide a placeholder, it would be:
Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but is expected to operate on a positive integer n, and the return value is undetermined.**
