The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. However, the code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be the integer converted from the user's input. This means the previous constraint on `n` (2 <= n <= 10^9) is no longer guaranteed to hold after the execution of the code, as the user can input any integer value. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
