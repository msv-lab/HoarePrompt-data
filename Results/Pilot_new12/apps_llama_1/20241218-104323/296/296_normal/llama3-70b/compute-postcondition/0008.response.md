The code prints '1' and the value of `n`. 'YES' has been printed, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 2 has been printed, '1' has been printed, and `n // 2` has been printed. The print statement does not modify the values of the variables. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 'YES' has been printed, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 2 has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, `n // 2` has been printed, and '1' and the value of `n` have been printed.
Output State: **'YES' has been printed, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 2 has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, `n // 2` has been printed, and '1' and the value of `n` have been printed**
