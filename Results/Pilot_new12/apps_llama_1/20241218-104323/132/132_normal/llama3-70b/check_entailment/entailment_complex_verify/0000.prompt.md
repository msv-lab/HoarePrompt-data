You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that it checks if the sorted lists `x` and `y` are equal. However, the problem statement does not require the lists to be equal after sorting. Instead, it should check if it's possible to transform the first list into the second list by either removing stones from some piles or moving stones from one pile to another.

A counterexample is when the input is:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5
```

The sum of the stones is equal in both cases, but the program will sort the lists and compare them, which will result in `No` being printed, even though it is possible to transform the first list into the second list by moving a stone from the second pile to the first pile, and moving a stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

The program should instead check if the sum of the stones is equal, and if the difference between corresponding elements in `x` and `y` can be explained by the movement or removal of stones. 

Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x)!= sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if x[i] > y[i]:
                diff = x[i] - y[i]
                j = 0
                while diff > 0 and j < n:
                    if j == i:
                        j += 1
                        continue
                    if diff <= x[j] - y[j]:
                        diff -= x[j] - y[j]
                        y[j] += x[j] - y[j]
                    else:
                        diff -= x[j] - y[j]
                        x[j] = y[j]
                    j += 1
                if diff > 0:
                    print('No')
                    return
        print('Yes')

```

This implementation checks if the difference between corresponding elements can be explained by the removal or movement of stones. If it can, then it prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50), representing the number of piles with stones. The second and third lines contain n integers each, representing the initial and final number of stones in each pile, respectively, where each number is between 0 and 1000, inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is a list of integers read from the input. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' has been printed. If the sum of `x` is equal to the sum of `y`, `x` and `y` are sorted lists, and 'Yes' has been printed if `x` is equal to `y`, otherwise 'No' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes three lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) and the second and third lines contain `n` integers each, representing initial and final stone counts in piles. The function checks if the sum of the initial stone counts is equal to the sum of the final stone counts. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts the initial and final stone counts and checks if the sorted lists are equal. If the sorted lists are equal, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values, wrong number of lines or values per line). After execution, the program state is that 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed to the console based on the comparison of the initial and final stone counts, and the input variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been modified to hold the input values and the results of the sorting operation, respectively. If the input is valid and in the correct format, the function provides a result indicating whether the initial and final stone counts can be transformed into each other by rearranging the stones in the piles, assuming that the total number of stones remains the same.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
