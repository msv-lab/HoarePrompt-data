You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks if the sorted lists of stone piles are equal, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the records can be consistent. The problem description states that the jury members can move one stone from one pile to another or take one stone for themselves, which means that the number of stones in each pile can change. However, the total number of stones should remain the same if only moving occurs, or decrease if stones are taken.

The program correctly checks if the total number of stones is the same, but then it sorts the lists and checks if they are equal. This is not enough to ensure that the records can be consistent, because it does not consider the possibility that stones can be moved from one pile to another.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```

The program will output "No", which is correct. However, if we consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
2 1 3
```

The program will output "Yes", because the sorted lists are equal. However, this is correct because stones can be moved from one pile to another to achieve the second state from the first state.

But consider the input:

```
3
10 0 0
0 0 10
```

The program will output "Yes", because the sorted lists are equal. However, if only one stone can be moved at a time and the number of stones that can be taken is not limited, this does not mean that it is possible to move all stones from the first pile to the third pile in one night. The correct output in this case would be "Yes" because we can move stones one by one.

However, consider the input:

```
3
10 0 0
0 10 0
```

The program will output "Yes", because the sorted lists are equal. However, the correct output in this case would be "Yes" because stones can be moved from the first pile to the second pile.

But the issue is that the program does not correctly handle cases where the number of stones in some piles decreases or increases by more than one. In such cases, the program may output "Yes" even if it is not possible to achieve the second state from the first state by moving or taking stones.

To fix this issue, the program should check if it is possible to achieve the second state from the first state by moving or taking stones one by one. This can be done by checking if the difference between the number of stones in each pile is at most one, and if the total number of stones does not increase.

However, the program is still incorrect because it does not handle cases where stones are taken correctly. The correct condition to check is that the sum of the stones in the second state is less than or equal to the sum of the stones in the first state, and for each pile, the difference between the number of stones in the first and second states is either 0, or the number of stones in the second state is one less than the number of stones in the first state, or the difference is -1 times the number of stones that have been moved to this pile. 

Here's an example of how you might correct the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) < sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        diff = [a - b for a, b in zip(x, y)]
        if all(d >= 0 for d in diff) and sum(diff) == sum(x) - sum(y):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected program first checks if the total number of stones in the first state is less than the total number of stones in the second state. If so, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it calculates the difference in the number of stones between each pair of corresponding piles, and checks if all these differences are non-negative and if their sum equals the difference in the total number of stones between the two states. If so, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50), representing the number of piles with stones. The second and third lines contain n integers each, representing the initial and final number of stones in each pile, respectively, where each number is between 0 and 1000, inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is a list of integers read from the input. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' has been printed. If the sum of `x` is equal to the sum of `y`, `x` and `y` are sorted lists, and 'Yes' has been printed if `x` is equal to `y`, otherwise 'No' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes three lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) and the second and third lines contain `n` integers each, representing initial and final stone counts in piles. The function checks if the sum of the initial stone counts is equal to the sum of the final stone counts. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts the initial and final stone counts and checks if the sorted lists are equal. If the sorted lists are equal, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values, wrong number of lines or values per line). After execution, the program state is that 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed to the console based on the comparison of the initial and final stone counts, and the input variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been modified to hold the input values and the results of the sorting operation, respectively. If the input is valid and in the correct format, the function provides a result indicating whether the initial and final stone counts can be transformed into each other by rearranging the stones in the piles, assuming that the total number of stones remains the same.
