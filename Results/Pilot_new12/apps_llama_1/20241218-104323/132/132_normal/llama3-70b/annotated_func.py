#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50), representing the number of piles with stones. The second and third lines contain n integers each, representing the initial and final number of stones in each pile, respectively, where each number is between 0 and 1000, inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, 'Yes' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'No' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is a list of integers read from the input. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' has been printed. If the sum of `x` is equal to the sum of `y`, `x` and `y` are sorted lists, and 'Yes' has been printed if `x` is equal to `y`, otherwise 'No' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes three lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) and the second and third lines contain `n` integers each, representing initial and final stone counts in piles. The function checks if the sum of the initial stone counts is equal to the sum of the final stone counts. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts the initial and final stone counts and checks if the sorted lists are equal. If the sorted lists are equal, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values, wrong number of lines or values per line). After execution, the program state is that 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed to the console based on the comparison of the initial and final stone counts, and the input variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been modified to hold the input values and the results of the sorting operation, respectively. If the input is valid and in the correct format, the function provides a result indicating whether the initial and final stone counts can be transformed into each other by rearranging the stones in the piles, assuming that the total number of stones remains the same.
