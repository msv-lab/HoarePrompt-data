The code reads a line of input, splits it into separate values, converts each value to an integer, and stores them in a list called `x`. 

The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, representing the number of piles with stones. 

Since we don't know the exact values that will be read from the input, we can say that `x` will be a list of integers, where the length and values of the list are determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a list of integers read from the input**
