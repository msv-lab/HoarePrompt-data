The code snippet `print('Yes')` prints the string 'Yes' to the console, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of printing 'Yes' to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console.**
