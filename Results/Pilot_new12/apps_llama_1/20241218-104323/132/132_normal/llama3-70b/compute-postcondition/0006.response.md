The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and this relationship is not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`**
