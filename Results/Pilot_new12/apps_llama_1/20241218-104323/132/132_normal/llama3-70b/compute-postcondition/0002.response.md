The code creates a new list `y` by mapping the `int` function to the input split into substrings. The input is expected to be a string of space-separated integers.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `x` also remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. 

A new variable `y` is created and it is assigned the value of a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is a list of integers read from the input**
