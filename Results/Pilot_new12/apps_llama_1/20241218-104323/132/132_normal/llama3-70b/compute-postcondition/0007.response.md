The value of `y` is sorted in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. The sum of the elements in `x` is still equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, as sorting the list `y` does not change the sum of its elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `x` is a sorted list of integers, `y` is a sorted list of integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
