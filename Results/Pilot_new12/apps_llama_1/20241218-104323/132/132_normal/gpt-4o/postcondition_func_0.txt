The function takes three implicit inputs: a positive integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` of length `n`, where each integer in `x` and `y` is between 0 and 1000. It calculates the sum of all elements in `x` and `y`, then checks if the sum of `y` is greater than the sum of `x`. If the sum of `y` is greater, it prints 'No', otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating whether the total number of stones in piles recorded on the second visit is less than or equal to the total number of stones recorded on the first visit. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or non-numeric inputs for `n`, `x`, or `y`, or cases where the lengths of `x` and `y` do not match the input `n`. After execution, the program state will have `n`, `x`, and `y` defined, along with their respective sums `total_x` and `total_y`, and will have printed either 'Yes' or 'No' to the console, depending on the comparison of `total_x` and `total_y`.
