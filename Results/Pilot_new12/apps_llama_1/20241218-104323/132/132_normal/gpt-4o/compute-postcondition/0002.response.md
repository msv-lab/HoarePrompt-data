The given Python code snippet is `y = list(map(int, input().split()))`. 

Here is the step-by-step impact of the code on the program:

1. The code takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` function.
2. The `map(int,...)` function is then applied to this list, converting each string into an integer.
3. The resulting map object is then converted back into a list using the `list()` function.
4. This list of integers is then assigned to the variable `y`.

Considering the initial state, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, and `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers.

After executing the given code snippet, the value of `y` is updated to be a list of integers input by the user.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user**
