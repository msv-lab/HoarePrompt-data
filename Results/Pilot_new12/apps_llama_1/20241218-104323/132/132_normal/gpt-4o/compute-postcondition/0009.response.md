Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of all elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed to the console, indicating that the sum of all elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in `x`.**
