The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it has access to the number of piles `n`, and two lists of integers `x` and `y`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `x` and `y` are lists of `n` non-negative integers, each integer in the range 0 <= `xi`, `yi` <= 1000. 

Since the problem description doesn't specify the return value of the function, we can't provide a complete description of its functionality. However, based on the given constraints, we can describe the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but has access to a positive integer n and two lists of integers x and y, where n is between 1 and 50, and x and y are lists of n non-negative integers between 0 and 1000.**
