The code prints 'Yes' to the console, but does not change the values of any variables. The states of `n`, `x`, `y`, `total_x`, and `total_y` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of all elements in `y`, the sum of all elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of all elements in `y`, the sum of all elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console.**
