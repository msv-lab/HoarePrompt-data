The code calculates the sum of the elements in the list `x` and assigns it to the variable `total_x`. The value of `n` is not affected, and the list `y` is also not affected. The list `x` remains the same.

The value of `total_x` is equal to the sum of all elements in `x`. Since `x` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_x` will be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`**
