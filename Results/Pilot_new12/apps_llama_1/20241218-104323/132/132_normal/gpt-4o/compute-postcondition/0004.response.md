The code calculates the sum of all elements in `y` and assigns it to `total_y`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. The value of `total_x` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of all elements in `y`**
