The code overwrites the list `x` with a new list of integers. The new list `x` is created by mapping the `int` function to the input values split by spaces. The number of integers in the input is not specified, but based on the initial state, `n` is the number of integers in the lists `x` and `y`. 

However, the code does not guarantee that the new list `x` will have `n` integers. The length of the new list `x` will be equal to the number of integers in the input. The values in the new list `x` will be in the range of non-negative integers, but there is no guarantee that they will be in the range 0 <= xi <= 1000.

The states of the other variables, `n` and `y`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, each integer in the range of non-negative integers, `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each integer in the range 0 <= yi <= 1000, with 1 <= `n` <= 50**
