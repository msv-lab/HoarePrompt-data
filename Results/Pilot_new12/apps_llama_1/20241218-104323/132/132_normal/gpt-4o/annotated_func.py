#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit inputs, but the problem description implies that it has access to the number of piles n, and two lists of integers x and y representing the number of stones in piles recorded on the first and second visits, respectively. Here, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and x and y are lists of n non-negative integers, each integer in the range 0 <= xi, yi <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if (total_y > total_x) :
        print('No')
    else :
        print('Yes')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of non-negative integers with an unspecified length, `y` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of all elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed to the console, indicating that the sum of all elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three implicit inputs: a positive integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` of length `n`, where each integer in `x` and `y` is between 0 and 1000. It calculates the sum of all elements in `x` and `y`, then checks if the sum of `y` is greater than the sum of `x`. If the sum of `y` is greater, it prints 'No', otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating whether the total number of stones in piles recorded on the second visit is less than or equal to the total number of stones recorded on the first visit. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or non-numeric inputs for `n`, `x`, or `y`, or cases where the lengths of `x` and `y` do not match the input `n`. After execution, the program state will have `n`, `x`, and `y` defined, along with their respective sums `total_x` and `total_y`, and will have printed either 'Yes' or 'No' to the console, depending on the comparison of `total_x` and `total_y`.
