Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight here is that the total number of stones in the garden can either remain the same or decrease from the first day to the second day, but it cannot increase. This is because jury members can either move stones from one pile to another (which doesn't change the total number of stones) or take stones away (which decreases the total number of stones).

The program calculates the total number of stones in the piles on both days (`total_x` and `total_y`) and checks if the total number of stones on the second day is greater than on the first day. If it is, the program correctly outputs 'No', because this scenario is impossible according to the problem description.

In all other cases, the program outputs 'Yes', indicating that the records can be consistent. This is also correct, because as long as the total number of stones does not increase, it is possible for the jury members to move stones around or take them away to achieve the configuration observed on the second day.

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and follows the problem description. Therefore, it is correct in every potential case, and no counterexample can be found to contradict its logic.
