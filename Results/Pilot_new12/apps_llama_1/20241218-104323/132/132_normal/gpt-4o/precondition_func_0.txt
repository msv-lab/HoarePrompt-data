The function takes no explicit inputs, but the problem description implies that it has access to the number of piles n, and two lists of integers x and y representing the number of stones in piles recorded on the first and second visits, respectively. Here, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and x and y are lists of n non-negative integers, each integer in the range 0 <= xi, yi <= 1000.
