#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `n` is less than 2, `result` is 1.
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of `n` modulo 10^9 + 7, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the factorial of a given integer `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6`, and returns the result. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 2, despite the annotation suggesting it should return 1 in such cases. The actual code will return 1 for `n` less than 2 because the loop condition is not met, and the initial value of `result` is 1. Additionally, the function does not validate if `mod` is indeed `10^9 + 7`, but this value is used directly in the calculation. The function takes two parameters, `n` and `mod`, but `mod` must be `10^9 + 7` for the function to align with its intended purpose as described by the annotations. After execution, the program returns the calculated factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7` without altering the input values of `n` and `mod`.
