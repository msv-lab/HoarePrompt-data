Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks to count the number of permutations of integers 1 through n such that the function f(p) is equal to f_max(n), where f(p) is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of prefixes of p. However, the code simply calculates the factorial of n-1 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is not the correct solution to the problem.

The code does not take into account the actual definition of f(p) and f_max(n), and it does not attempt to find the permutations that satisfy the condition. The provided output hints suggest that the function is calculating the factorial, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

For example, for the input n = 3, the correct output should be 4, which are the permutations [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1], where f(p) = 2 for each permutation. However, the code calculates the factorial of 2, which is 2, and returns 2 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is not the correct answer. 

In general, the code does not correctly handle any input other than n = 2, for which it returns 1, which happens to be the correct answer. For all other inputs, the code returns an incorrect result. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
