Correctness: **True**

The program calculates the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The problem description defines $f_{max}(n)$ as the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$.
- For $n \ge 2$, $f_{max}(n)$ will always be the case where $p$ starts with $n$, $n-1$, $n-2$,..., $2$, $1$, or any other permutation of those numbers that maintains the property that $f(p)$ is maximal. 
- For a given $n$, this maximum value will always be $n-1$ because you can always start with the largest number and keep dividing by increasing numbers to reach $1$.
- Therefore, the number of permutations that have $f(p) = f_{max}(n)$ is $(n-1)!$, because once the first number is fixed (which has to be $n$ for $f(p)$ to be maximal), the rest of the numbers can be in any order.
- The program correctly calculates $(n-1)!$ modulo $10^9+7$ for $n \ge 2$.
- For the special case where $n = 2$, the program directly returns $1$, which is correct because there is only one permutation of $1$ and $2$ that has $f(p) = f_{max}(2) = 1$, namely the permutation $[2, 1]$.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description because it correctly calculates the number of permutations that have $f(p)$ equal to $f_{max}(n)$ for all valid inputs $n$.
