Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. 

The problem description asks to count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. The function $f(p)$ is defined as the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$,..., $g_n$ where $g_i$ is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$,..., $p_i$.

However, the provided Python program simply calculates the factorial of $n-1$ and uses it as the result. This approach is overly simplistic and does not take into account the actual GCD calculations and comparisons required for the $f(p)$ function.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when $n=3$. According to the problem description, $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$. But for $n=3$, the provided program simply calculates $func_1(n - 1, MOD) = func_1(2, MOD) = 2! = 2 \mod 1000000007 = 2$. This result does not match the expected output of $4$.

Therefore, the provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is considered incorrect.
