Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

The program seems to be calculating the factorial of $n-1$ and returning it as the result, which is incorrect. The problem requires a more complex calculation to determine the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$.

For example, when $n = 3$, the program returns $2$ which is not correct. The correct answer is $4$ as shown in the provided examples. This is because the program is not considering all the possible permutations and their corresponding $f(p)$ values.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, which takes into account the properties of the function $f(p)$ and the permutations of the integers $1$ to $n$. The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and therefore is incorrect. 

A correct approach would involve finding the maximum value $f_{max}(n)$ and then counting the number of permutations where $f(p)$ equals this maximum value. This would require a deeper understanding of the properties of the function $f(p)$ and the permutations of the integers $1$ to $n$.
