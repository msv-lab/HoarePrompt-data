Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, where `f_max(n)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`.

For `n >= 3`, the maximum value `f_max(n)` is `n` when the permutation starts with `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`,..., `1` (i.e., `f(p)` is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of the prefix of length `i`, which will be `n` for the permutation `n, n-1, n-2,..., 1`).

In the given program, if `n` is `2`, it directly returns `1`, which is correct because there is only one permutation (`1, 2`) with `f(p) = f_max(2) = 2`.

For `n >= 3`, it calls the function `func_1(n - 1, MOD)`, which calculates the factorial of `n - 1` modulo `MOD`. This is correct because the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)` is `(n - 1)!`, which is the number of permutations of the remaining `n - 1` numbers after fixing the first number to `n`. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not exceed `MOD`.

The function `func_1(n, mod)` correctly calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `mod` using a loop that multiplies each number from `2` to `n` with the result so far, and taking the result modulo `mod` at each step.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, as specified in the problem description.
