Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly calculate the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_{max}(n)`. The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n-1` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which does not take into account the actual calculation of `f(p)` and `f_{max}(n)`.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when `n` is greater than 2. In this case, the program simply returns the factorial of `n-1` modulo `10^9 + 7`, without considering the actual permutations and their `f(p)` values. The problem statement requires calculating the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_{max}(n)`, which involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of prefixes of the permutation and counting distinct GCD values. The code does not implement this calculation, and therefore does not produce the correct result for `n > 2`.

For example, when `n = 3`, the program returns `2! = 2`, but the correct result is `4`, as shown in the problem statement's examples. This discrepancy demonstrates that the program does not accurately solve the problem for all potential cases.
