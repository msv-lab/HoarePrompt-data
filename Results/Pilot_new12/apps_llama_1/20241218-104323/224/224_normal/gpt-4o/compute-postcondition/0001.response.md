According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, and `result` is 1. For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
