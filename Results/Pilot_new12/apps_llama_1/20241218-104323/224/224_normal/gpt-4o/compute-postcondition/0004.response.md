The code `result = result * i % mod` updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` and then taking the modulus with `mod`. Given the initial state: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 3.

First, we calculate `result * i`, which is 2 * 3 = 6. Then, we take the modulus of this product with `mod` (10^9 + 7). The result of 6 % (10^9 + 7) is simply 6 because 6 is less than (10^9 + 7).

Therefore, the value of `result` becomes 6. The states of the other variables (`n`, `mod`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
