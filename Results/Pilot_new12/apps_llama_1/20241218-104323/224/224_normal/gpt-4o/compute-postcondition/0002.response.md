The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` and taking the modulus with `mod`. The initial value of `result` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7.

The new value of `result` is calculated as (`result` * `i`) % `mod`. Substituting the given values, we get `result` = (1 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 2 % (10^9 + 7) = 2.

The states of the other variables (`n` and `mod`) are not affected. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation, it is still 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
