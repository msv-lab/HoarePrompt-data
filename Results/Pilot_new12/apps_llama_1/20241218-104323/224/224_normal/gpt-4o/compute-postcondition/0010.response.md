Functionality: **The function calculates the factorial of a given integer `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6`, and returns the result. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 2, despite the annotation suggesting it should return 1 in such cases. The actual code will return 1 for `n` less than 2 because the loop condition is not met, and the initial value of `result` is 1. Additionally, the function does not validate if `mod` is indeed `10^9 + 7`, but this value is used directly in the calculation. The function takes two parameters, `n` and `mod`, but `mod` must be `10^9 + 7` for the function to align with its intended purpose as described by the annotations. After execution, the program returns the calculated factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7` without altering the input values of `n` and `mod`.**
