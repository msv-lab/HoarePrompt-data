The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, and `mod` is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7. After executing the function body, the function returns the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and mod, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^6, and mod is 10^9 + 7, and returns the factorial of n modulo mod.**
