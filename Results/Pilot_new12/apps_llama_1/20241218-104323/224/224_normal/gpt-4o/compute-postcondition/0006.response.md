To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^6
- `mod` is 10^9 + 7
- `result` is 6
- `i` is 4

The given code is:
```python
result = result * i % mod
```

This code multiplies the current value of `result` by `i` and then takes the modulus of the product with `mod`. 

Given `result` is 6, `i` is 4, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7, we can calculate the new value of `result` as follows:
- First, multiply `result` by `i`: 6 * 4 = 24
- Then, take the modulus of the product with `mod`: 24 % (10^9 + 7)

Since 24 is less than (10^9 + 7), the result of the modulus operation is simply 24. Hence, the new value of `result` is 24.

The states of `n`, `mod`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^6
- `mod` is 10^9 + 7
- `result` is 24
- `i` is 4

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 24, `i` is 4**
