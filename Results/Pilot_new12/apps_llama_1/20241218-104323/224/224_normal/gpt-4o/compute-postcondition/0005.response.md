According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again, but since the range starts at 2, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4. Since `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, but since `n` is already greater than or equal to 3 and now `i` is 4, it means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
