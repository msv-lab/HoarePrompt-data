The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7. Given that `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, we need to consider the calculation of the factorial of `n` and then take the modulus of this value with `mod`. If `n` is less than 2, `result` is 1, but since `n` is between 2 and 10^6, `result` will be the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`. 

Output State: **The program returns the factorial of `n` modulo 10^9 + 7, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6**
