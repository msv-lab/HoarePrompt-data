According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 3**
