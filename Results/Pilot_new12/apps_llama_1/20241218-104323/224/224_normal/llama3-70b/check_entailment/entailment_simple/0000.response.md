Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem asks for the count of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

However, the function `func_2(n)` does not calculate $f_{max}(n)$ correctly. It calculates the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, where `func_1` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is not the same as finding the maximum number of distinct GCDs in a permutation of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$.

Moreover, the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. This does not correspond to counting permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, and then count the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to this maximum value. This requires a more complex approach, such as generating all permutations and calculating $f(p)$ for each permutation.

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
