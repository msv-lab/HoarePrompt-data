Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires finding the number of permutations of integers 1 to n, such that the function f(p) is equal to f_max(n), where f(p) is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of the prefixes of the permutation p. 

However, upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the implementation does not accurately capture the problem description. The function func_2 is intended to calculate f_max(n), but it seems to be calculating something different. The function func_1 calculates the GCD of two numbers, but func_2 uses it in a way that does not align with the problem description.

Moreover, the function func_3 seems to be calculating a cumulative sum, but it's not clear how this relates to the problem of finding the number of permutations with a certain property.

One specific case where the program may not work correctly is when n is a prime number. In this case, the function f_max(n) should be equal to 2, because the only possible GCDs are 1 and the prime number itself. However, it's not clear whether the provided code correctly calculates this case.

Additionally, the code does not seem to handle the case where n is a power of a prime number. In this case, the function f_max(n) should be equal to the number of distinct prime factors of n, plus 1. However, the provided code does not seem to account for this case.

Overall, while the code may produce correct results for some small values of n, it does not appear to accurately capture the problem description, and it's likely to produce incorrect results for larger values of n or for certain special cases.
