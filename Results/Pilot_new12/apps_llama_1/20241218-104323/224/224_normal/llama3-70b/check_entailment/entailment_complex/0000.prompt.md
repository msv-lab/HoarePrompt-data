You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where b is non-zero and a and b are used to calculate their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` where `b` is non-zero, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of `a` as stated in the annotations. The return postcondition that the program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a` is incorrect based on the code provided, which actually implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `a` and `b`. The function will always return an integer value representing the GCD, regardless of the sign of the input integers `a` and `b`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has returned the GCD of the original input integers, with no side effects on the input variables `a` and `b`. Note that the function does not handle the case where `b` is zero, as this would lead to an infinite loop.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, and res is an integer that stores the result of the function func_1, initialized to 0.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying the function `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0. The function initializes a variable `res` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), updating `res` with the maximum value between the current `res` and the result of `func_1(res, i)` at each iteration. After the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`, which represents the maximum achievable value. Note that the functionality of `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so its behavior is assumed to be defined elsewhere. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, or where `func_1` returns a non-integer value, as these cases are not explicitly addressed in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and f_max_n is an integer such that 1 <= f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, and for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, repeated `n` times.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times, with `dp[0]` initialized to 1, and 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` calculates and returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `f_max_n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `f_max_n` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The function initializes the sequence with `dp[0]` set to 1 and then iteratively updates each term `dp[j]` to be the sum of the previous `dp[j]` and `dp[j-1]`, taken modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. The state of the program after execution will have `n` and `f_max_n` unchanged, but the function will have calculated and returned the `f_max_n`-th term in the sequence. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or `f_max_n` is outside the range 1 to `n`, and it assumes that the inputs are integers. If the inputs are not valid, the function's behavior may be undefined or incorrect.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
