Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, such that f(p) is equal to f_max(n). 

The issue lies in the calculation of f_max(n) in function func_2. The function calculates the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying the function func_1 to the previous result and the next integer up to n, starting from 0. However, this approach does not correctly calculate f_max(n), which is defined as the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n.

For example, when n = 3, the function func_2 returns 1, but the correct value of f_max(3) is 2, which can be achieved by permutations like [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].

Furthermore, function func_3 calculates the f_max_n-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated n times. However, this sequence does not correctly represent the number of permutations p such that f(p) is equal to f_max(n).

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
