Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires calculating the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, and then counting the number of permutations `p` for which `f(p)` is equal to this maximum value.

However, the function `func_2` calculates the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0, which does not necessarily correspond to the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations.

Furthermore, the function `func_3` calculates the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times, which does not accurately represent the number of permutations `p` for which `f(p)` is equal to `f_max_n`.

For example, when `n = 3`, the function `func_2` returns `1`, which is not the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations of `1`, `2`, and `3`. The correct maximum value is `2`, which can be achieved by the permutations `[2, 1, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, `[3, 1, 2]`, and `[3, 2, 1]`. The function `func_3` then returns `4`, which is the correct count of permutations with `f(p) = 2`, but this is a coincidence and not a result of the correct calculation.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
