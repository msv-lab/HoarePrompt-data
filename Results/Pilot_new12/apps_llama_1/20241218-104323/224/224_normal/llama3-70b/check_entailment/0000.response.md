Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not accurately solve the problem as described. It attempts to calculate the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, but it lacks a crucial step: generating all permutations and calculating `f(p)` for each.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The `func_2` function attempts to calculate `f_max(n)`, but it's incomplete as it only keeps track of the maximum GCD seen so far, without considering the actual definition of `f(p)` which involves counting distinct GCDs for prefixes of a permutation.

The `func_3` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, but it's flawed because it doesn't actually calculate `f(p)` for any permutation. Instead, it simply accumulates values in a DP table without any clear connection to the problem's requirements.

A correct approach would involve generating all permutations of numbers from 1 to `n`, calculating `f(p)` for each permutation by finding the GCD of prefixes and counting distinct GCDs, and then counting the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`.

For example, consider the input `n = 3`. The code should generate all 6 permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`, calculate `f(p)` for each (which would be `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 2, 1]`, `[1, 2, 1]`, `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 1]`), and then count the number of permutations where `f(p)` equals `f_max(3) = 2`. However, the provided code does not perform these steps correctly.
