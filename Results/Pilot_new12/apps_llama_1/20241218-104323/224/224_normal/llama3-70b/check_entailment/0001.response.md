Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct for all potential cases. The function `func_2(n)` is used to calculate the maximum value of `f(p)`, but it only calculates the GCD of all numbers from 1 to `n`, which is not the same as `f_max(n)`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the function `func_2(n)` returns `1`, which is the GCD of all numbers from 1 to 6. However, `f_max(n)` for `n = 6` is actually `4`, because there are permutations of numbers from 1 to 6 for which the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes is `4`.

The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` also has a bug. It is trying to calculate the number of permutations with `f(p) = f_max(n)`, but the current implementation is incorrect. It's trying to calculate a DP table, but the logic is wrong.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the actual permutations of numbers and checking their `f(p)` values, or using a correct mathematical formula to calculate the number of permutations with `f(p) = f_max(n)`.

The provided code seems to be an incorrect attempt to solve the problem and does not cover all the cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**. 

Note that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it doesn't consider all the possible permutations and their `f(p)` values, it just calculates the GCD of all numbers and tries to use it to find the number of permutations, which is incorrect. 

In the provided examples, it seems the code might work by chance for small inputs, but it will fail for larger inputs or different cases. Therefore, it is not a correct solution to the given problem. 

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to calculate the actual permutations and their `f(p)` values, or use a correct mathematical formula to calculate the number of permutations with `f(p) = f_max(n)`. 

However, the given code seems to be an attempt to solve a different problem and does not follow the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**. 

The code does not handle the case when `n` is greater than `6` correctly and it does not calculate `f_max(n)` correctly. 

For example, when `n = 7`, the function `func_2(n)` returns `1`, which is the GCD of all numbers from 1 to 7. However, `f_max(n)` for `n = 7` is actually `4`, because there are permutations of numbers from 1 to 7 for which the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes is `4`.
