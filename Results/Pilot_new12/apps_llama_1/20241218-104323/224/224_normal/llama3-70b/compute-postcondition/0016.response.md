The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments the value of `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n`, this operation updates the value of `dp[f_max_n]` to be the sum of its previous value and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`.

The initial state provides that `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` > 0, `dp[j]` is the result of cumulative sums modulo `MOD`. However, the specific update operation `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` does not involve taking the result modulo `MOD`. Thus, the update directly affects the value of `dp[f_max_n]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. 

The value of `dp[f_max_n]` becomes `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, which is equivalent to the cumulative sum up to `f_max_n` without taking modulo `MOD` at this step.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[j]` for `j` > 0 is updated according to cumulative sums, specifically `dp[f_max_n]` is now `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
