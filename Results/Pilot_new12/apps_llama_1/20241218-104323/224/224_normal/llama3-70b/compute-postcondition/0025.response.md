According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1**
