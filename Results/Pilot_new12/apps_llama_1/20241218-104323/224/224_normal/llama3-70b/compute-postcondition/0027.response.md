`dp[j]` becomes `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, which is equivalent to the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, the value of `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to be the sum of the original `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD` implicitly due to the previous definition of `dp[k]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` is `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`**
