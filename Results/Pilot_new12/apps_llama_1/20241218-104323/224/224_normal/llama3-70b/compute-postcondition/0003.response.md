According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is introduced in the loop and will take values from 1 to `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so its state needs to be adjusted to be equal to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**
