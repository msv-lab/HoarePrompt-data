According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `f_max_n - 2`. Since `j` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 1, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0, and the rest except `dp[0]` and `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2**
