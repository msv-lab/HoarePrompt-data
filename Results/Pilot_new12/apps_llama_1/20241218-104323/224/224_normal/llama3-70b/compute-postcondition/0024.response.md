To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
    dp[j] %= MOD
```
From the given output states, we can see that the loop is updating the values of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`.

After the loop finishes executing, the values of `dp[j]` will be the cumulative sums of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, for all `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.

The original value of `dp[0]` is 1, and it is not updated by the loop since the loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to 1.

The final value of `j` will be 1, since the loop starts from `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

The value of `i` is not updated by the loop, so it will remain 2.

The values of `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` are not updated by the loop, so they will remain the same.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
