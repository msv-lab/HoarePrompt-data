To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0
- `MOD` is 10^9 + 7
- `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1 and the rest are zeros
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `f_max_n`

Since the loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1 (excluding, since the stop value in `range()` is exclusive) with a step of -1, the variable `j` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `f_max_n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must decrease by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`.

The other variables do not directly depend on the loop iteration, so their values remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
