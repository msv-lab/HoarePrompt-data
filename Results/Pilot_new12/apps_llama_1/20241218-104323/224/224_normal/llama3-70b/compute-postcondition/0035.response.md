To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
    dp[j] %= MOD
```
Given the initial state and the loop code, we can infer the following:

- The loop iterates over the range from `f_max_n` down to 1 (inclusive), given the condition `1 <= f_max_n <= n` and the loop range `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`.
- In each iteration, it adds the value of `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[j]` and then takes the result modulo `MOD` to update `dp[j]`.
- The original values of `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` are cumulative sums of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`. However, this is a misleading statement because it describes the original calculation of `dp[j]`, not the loop's operation. The key point is that the loop modifies these values further.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see patterns emerging:

- `dp[f_max_n]` becomes `(dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % MOD` after the first iteration.
- `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are updated in subsequent iterations to include sums of previous `dp` values, all taken modulo `MOD`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, given the loop condition.

To generalize the output state after all iterations have finished, consider what the loop does:

- It starts from `f_max_n` and moves backward to 1, updating each `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- By the time it finishes, each `dp[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`) will have accumulated the sum of all `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `j - 1`, plus its original value, all taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.

However, the provided descriptions of the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations slightly misrepresent the process by implying a direct cumulative sum without accounting for the modulo operation's effect on preventing the values from growing beyond `MOD - 1`.

The correct interpretation should focus on how the loop modifies the `dp` array by effectively "spreading" the values from higher indices to lower ones, with each step being a modulo operation that keeps the values within a certain range.

Thus, after all iterations, the `dp` array will have been transformed such that each `dp[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`) contains a value that is the result of adding its original value to the accumulated sum of the original values of all `dp[k]` for `k` from 0 to `j - 1`, all taken modulo `MOD`. However, due to the nature of the loop, which moves from `f_max_n` downwards, the actual outcome for each `dp[j]` is more complex, reflecting the accumulated sums as modified by previous iterations.

Given this, and considering the format required for the answer, the output state should reflect the transformation of the `dp` array, the constancy of `n` and `MOD`, and the final state of `j` and `i`, which are determined by the loop's range and the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `i` remains 3, `j` is 1 after the loop finishes, and for `k` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[k]` contains the updated value resulting from the loop's operations, which effectively spreads and accumulates the original `dp` values modulo `MOD`.**
