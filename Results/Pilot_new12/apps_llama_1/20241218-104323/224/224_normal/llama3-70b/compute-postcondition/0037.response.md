The program returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, repeated `n` times. Since `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, we can infer that `dp[f_max_n]` is the result of this cumulative sum operation repeated `n` times.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, and `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[f_max_n]` will be the `f_max_n`-th term in this sequence, which is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, modulo `MOD`, repeated `n` times.

Output State: **The program returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times, with `dp[0]` initialized to 1, and 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
