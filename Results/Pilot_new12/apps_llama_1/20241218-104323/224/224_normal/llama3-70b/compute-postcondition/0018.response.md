According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, `i` is 2. Since the loop iterates in reverse order, `j` is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration. So, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `f_max_n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
