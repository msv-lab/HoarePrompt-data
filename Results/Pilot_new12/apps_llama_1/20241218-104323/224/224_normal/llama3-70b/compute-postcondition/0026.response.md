According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 1, which means it's already at the lower limit of the loop. For the loop to execute, `j` should be equal to `f_max_n` because the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. Since `f_max_n` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is greater than 3, `f_max_n` can be any integer between 1 and `n`. `i` is given as 3 but is not used in the loop, so its value does not directly affect the loop's execution. `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` have been calculated before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`**
