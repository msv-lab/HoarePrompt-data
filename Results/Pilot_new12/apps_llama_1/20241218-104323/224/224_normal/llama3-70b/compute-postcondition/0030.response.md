The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, we know that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. 

So, `dp[j]` is equivalent to `dp[f_max_n - 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` is equivalent to `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

The value of `dp[f_max_n]` is still (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, but the value of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` has been updated to `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` >= `j` + 1, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD` where `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`, `i` is 3, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` >= `j` + 1, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + (dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2])`) % `MOD`, `i` is 3, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
