Since `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, taking the modulus of 1 with `MOD` (which is 10^9 + 7) will still result in 1, because 1 is less than `MOD`. 

Therefore, the value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n]`) remains 1 after the modulus operation.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
