The given code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` affects the value of `dp[j]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. 

The new value of `dp[j]` is the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`. 

So, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` becomes `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`.**
