To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, which means `i` will take values from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in each iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`.
- `MOD` is 10^9 + 7.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` > 0, `dp[j]` is the result of cumulative sums modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The other variables (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, and the state of `dp`) do not directly depend on the loop variable `i` for their values to change within the context of the loop statement provided. However, considering the increment of `i`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again when `i` is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` > 0, `dp[j]` is the result of cumulative sums modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**
