The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. Since `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 2]` and initially all elements of `dp` except `dp[0]` and `dp[f_max_n]` are zeros, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` becomes 0 + `dp[f_max_n - 2]` which is 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, the value of `f_max_n` is still an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is still 10^9 + 7, `dp` is still a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0 + `dp[f_max_n - 2]` which equals to 0 and the rest are zeros, `i` is still 1, `j` is still `f_max_n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0, and the rest except `dp[0]` and `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
