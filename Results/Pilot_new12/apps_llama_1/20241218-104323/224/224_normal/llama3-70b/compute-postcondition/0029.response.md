According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1. 

Since `j` is equal to `f_max_n` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` becomes `f_max_n - 1`. The value of `f_max_n` does not need to change as it is the upper limit for the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` >= `j` + 1, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, for `k` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[k]` is the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[k]` and `dp[k - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 3, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
