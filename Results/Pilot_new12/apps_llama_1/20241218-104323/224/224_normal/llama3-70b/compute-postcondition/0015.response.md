According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` > 0, `dp[j]` is the result of cumulative sums modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. Since the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1, for the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` must be equal to `f_max_n` at the start of the loop. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and for `j` > 0, `dp[j]` is the result of cumulative sums modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
