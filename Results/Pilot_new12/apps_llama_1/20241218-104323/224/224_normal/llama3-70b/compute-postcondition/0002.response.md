The value of `dp[0]` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is still an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is still 10^9 + 7, and `dp` is now a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest of the elements are still zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**
