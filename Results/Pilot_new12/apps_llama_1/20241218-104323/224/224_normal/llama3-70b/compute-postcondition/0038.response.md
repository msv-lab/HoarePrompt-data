The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`. The function returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and f_max_n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and f_max_n is an integer between 1 and n, and returns the f_max_n-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7.**
