The given code snippet is `dp[j] %= MOD`. 

`dp[j]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`, where `MOD` is 10^9 + 7. The values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and the initial values of `dp` are not affected by this operation. 

`dp[0]` remains 1, `dp[j]` for `j` > 0 is still based on cumulative sums, but now `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n]`) is equal to (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`.

The output state is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[j]` for `j` > 0 is updated according to cumulative sums, specifically `dp[f_max_n]` is now (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
