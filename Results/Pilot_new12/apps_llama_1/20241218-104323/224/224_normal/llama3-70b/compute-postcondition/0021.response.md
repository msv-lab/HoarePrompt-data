According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `f_max_n - 2`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is (`dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`) % `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is (`dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`) % `MOD`**
