The code creates a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1`, initialized with zeros. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `f_max_n` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. `MOD` is a constant equal to 10^9 + 7.

The creation of the `dp` list does not affect the values of `n`, `f_max_n`, or `MOD`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` zeros**
