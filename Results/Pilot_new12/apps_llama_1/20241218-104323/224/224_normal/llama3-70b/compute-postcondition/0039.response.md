Functionality: **The function `func_3` calculates and returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `f_max_n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `f_max_n` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The function initializes the sequence with `dp[0]` set to 1 and then iteratively updates each term `dp[j]` to be the sum of the previous `dp[j]` and `dp[j-1]`, taken modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. The state of the program after execution will have `n` and `f_max_n` unchanged, but the function will have calculated and returned the `f_max_n`-th term in the sequence. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or `f_max_n` is outside the range 1 to `n`, and it assumes that the inputs are integers. If the inputs are not valid, the function's behavior may be undefined or incorrect.**
