According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `f_max_n` because the loop starts from `f_max_n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
