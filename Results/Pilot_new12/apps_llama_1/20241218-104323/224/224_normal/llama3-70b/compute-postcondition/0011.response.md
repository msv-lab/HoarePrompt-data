The value of `dp[j]` is increased by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The initial state has `j` as `f_max_n - 2` and `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 3]` which was initially 0 since it is one of the rest of the elements except `dp[0]`, `dp[f_max_n]`, and `dp[f_max_n - 1]`. Therefore, `dp[j]` becomes `dp[j] + 0` which is `dp[j]`. Since `dp[j]` was initially 0, `dp[j]` is still 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is still an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 1, `MOD` is still 10^9 + 7, `i` is still 1, and `j` is still `f_max_n - 2`. The list `dp` is updated at index `j` but since the addition was 0, the value is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 1, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is 0, and the rest except `dp[0]`, `dp[f_max_n]`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]`, and `dp[f_max_n - 2]` are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2**
