The value of `dp[j]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. Since `j` is `f_max_n - 1` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is still 0 because 0 modulo any number is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 0, and the rest except `dp[0]` and `dp[f_max_n]` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
