The value of `dp[j]` is increased by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n` and `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1]` which is 0. Therefore, `dp[j]` which is `dp[f_max_n]` becomes 0 + 0 = 0, but since `dp[f_max_n]` was initially 0, `dp[f_max_n]` is now 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n` and `f_max_n` > 0, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp` is a list of `f_max_n + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[f_max_n]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
