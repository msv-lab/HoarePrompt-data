The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying the function `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0. The function initializes a variable `res` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), updating `res` with the maximum value between the current `res` and the result of `func_1(res, i)` at each iteration. After the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`, which represents the maximum achievable value. Note that the functionality of `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so its behavior is assumed to be defined elsewhere. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, or where `func_1` returns a non-integer value, as these cases are not explicitly addressed in the provided code.
