#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where b is non-zero and a and b are used to calculate their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` where `b` is non-zero, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of `a` as stated in the annotations. The return postcondition that the program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a` is incorrect based on the code provided, which actually implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `a` and `b`. The function will always return an integer value representing the GCD, regardless of the sign of the input integers `a` and `b`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has returned the GCD of the original input integers, with no side effects on the input variables `a` and `b`. Note that the function does not handle the case where `b` is zero, as this would lead to an infinite loop.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, and res is an integer that stores the result of the function func_1, initialized to 0.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns the maximum value achievable from iteratively applying the function `func_1` to the previous result and the next integer up to `n`, starting from 0. The function initializes a variable `res` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), updating `res` with the maximum value between the current `res` and the result of `func_1(res, i)` at each iteration. After the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`, which represents the maximum achievable value. Note that the functionality of `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so its behavior is assumed to be defined elsewhere. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, or where `func_1` returns a non-integer value, as these cases are not explicitly addressed in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and f_max_n is an integer such that 1 <= f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is an integer such that 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, `MOD` is 10^9 + 7, `dp[0]` is 1, and for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sum of the original values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, taken modulo `MOD`, repeated `n` times.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times, with `dp[0]` initialized to 1, and 1 <= `f_max_n` <= `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` calculates and returns the `f_max_n`-th term in a sequence where each term is the cumulative sum of the two preceding ones, modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `f_max_n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `f_max_n` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The function initializes the sequence with `dp[0]` set to 1 and then iteratively updates each term `dp[j]` to be the sum of the previous `dp[j]` and `dp[j-1]`, taken modulo 10^9 + 7, repeated `n` times. The state of the program after execution will have `n` and `f_max_n` unchanged, but the function will have calculated and returned the `f_max_n`-th term in the sequence. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or `f_max_n` is outside the range 1 to `n`, and it assumes that the inputs are integers. If the inputs are not valid, the function's behavior may be undefined or incorrect.
