To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. In each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, appends them as a tuple to the `ratings` list, and checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it sets `is_rated` to `True`.

Given this behavior, after all iterations have finished:

1. **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations and does not depend on the loop's execution.
2. **`ratings`**: Will be a list containing `n` tuples, where each tuple is a pair of integers `(a, b)` read during each iteration of the loop.
3. **`is_rated`**: Will be `True` if at least one pair of `(a, b)` had `a` not equal to `b`. If all pairs had `a` equal to `b`, `is_rated` remains `False`.
4. **`is_unrated`**: Remains `False` as there is no condition in the loop that sets it to `True`.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `True` if any pair of integers in `ratings` are not equal, otherwise `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`.**
