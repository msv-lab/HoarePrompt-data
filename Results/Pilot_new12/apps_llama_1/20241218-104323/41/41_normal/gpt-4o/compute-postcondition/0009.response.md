Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True` and `is_unrated` is `False`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged as `False`.**
