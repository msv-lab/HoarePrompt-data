The code provided is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. 

Since no loop or conditional statement is provided in the given code snippet, we will assume that the break statement is inside a loop or conditional statement that is not shown in the given snippet.

The values of the variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`, and `i` do not change because of the break statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 1, the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 1, the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
