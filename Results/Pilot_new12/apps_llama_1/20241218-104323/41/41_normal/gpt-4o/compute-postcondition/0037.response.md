Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. `is_rated` is `True`, and the current value of `is_unrated` is determined based on the previous state: if `is_rated` was previously `False`, then `is_unrated` is `True` if any rating's first element is greater than the previous one, otherwise `is_unrated` is `False`; if `is_rated` was previously `True`, then the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged.**
