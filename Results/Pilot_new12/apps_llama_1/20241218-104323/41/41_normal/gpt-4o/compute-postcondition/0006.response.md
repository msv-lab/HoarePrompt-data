The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The initial state of `ratings` is an empty list, so after the execution of the code, `ratings` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(a, b)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
