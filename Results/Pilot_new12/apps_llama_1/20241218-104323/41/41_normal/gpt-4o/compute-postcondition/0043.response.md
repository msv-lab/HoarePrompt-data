The provided code snippet is a simple print statement. This print statement does not affect the values of any variables. 

The initial state provided is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`, indicating that no rating's first element is greater than the previous one, meaning the list of ratings is in non-increasing order based on the first element of each tuple.

Since the code does not modify any variables, all the variables retain their original values. The statement `print('maybe')` simply prints the string 'maybe' to the output, but does not alter the state of any variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`, the string 'maybe' has been printed.**
