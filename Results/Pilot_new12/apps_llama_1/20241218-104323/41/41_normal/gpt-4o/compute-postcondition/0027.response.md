According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
