Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`. If `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part.***
