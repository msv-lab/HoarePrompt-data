The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is still a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is still `False`, and `i` is still 1. The relationship between the elements in `ratings` at indices `i-1` and `i` remains the same, with the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` being less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 1, and the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`.**
