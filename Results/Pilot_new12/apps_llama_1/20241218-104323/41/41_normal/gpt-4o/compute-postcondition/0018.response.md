The code sets `is_rated` to `True`. The values of `n` and `ratings` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing three tuples, the first two tuples are the initial tuples, the third tuple is `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are input integers, `is_rated` is `True`**
