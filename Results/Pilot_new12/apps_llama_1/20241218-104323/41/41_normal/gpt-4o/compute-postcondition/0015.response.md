According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, which means the loop will execute one more time if `n` is greater than 1. However, considering the loop has already executed once, `n` must be greater than 1 for the next iteration to occur, implying that the value of `n` should be at least 2 for the previous iteration to have occurred and more than 1 for the next iteration to happen.

Since the loop variable is `_`, it does not affect the state. The states of `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged as they are not influenced by the loop counter directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples `(a, b)`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True` and `is_unrated` is `False`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged**
