The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is still a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is still 2, and `is_rated` is still `False`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
