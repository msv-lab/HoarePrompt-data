Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, and `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is used to compare elements in `ratings`, and the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`.**
