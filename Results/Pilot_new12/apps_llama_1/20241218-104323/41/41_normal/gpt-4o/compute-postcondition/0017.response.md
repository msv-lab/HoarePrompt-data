The code appends a new tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The initial state of `ratings` is a list containing two tuples `(a, b)`, and `a` and `b` are input integers. 

After executing the code, `ratings` becomes a list containing three tuples `(a, b)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing three tuples, the first two tuples are the initial tuples, the third tuple is `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are input integers**
