According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, this condition is already met. The loop will execute `n` times. 

The variables `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` do not affect the execution of the loop, but their states should be noted. 

Since the loop iterates `n` times, and `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute at least twice.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`**
