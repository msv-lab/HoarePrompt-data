Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples `(a, b)`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True` and `is_unrated` is `False`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged as the else part is not specified.***
