The code `break` will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 3, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
