Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 1. If the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`, then `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` is not less than the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged as `False`.***
