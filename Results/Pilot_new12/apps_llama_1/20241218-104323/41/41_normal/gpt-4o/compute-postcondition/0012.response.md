The code `ratings.append((a, b))` appends a new tuple `(a, b)` to the `ratings` list. The value of `n` is not changed, so it remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. The values of `a` and `b` are also not changed. The `is_rated` and `is_unrated` variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same. The `ratings` list now contains two tuples: the original tuple `(a, b)` and the new tuple `(a, b)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples `(a, b)`, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is the new input integer. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True` and `is_unrated` is `False`. If `a` equals `b`, then `is_rated` is `False` and `is_unrated` is `False`.**
