The provided Python code snippet is `print('rated')`. This code simply prints the string 'rated' to the console.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2,
- `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers,
- `is_rated` is `True`,
- The state of `is_unrated` depends on the previous state of `is_rated` and the values in `ratings`.

Since the code `print('rated')` does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the string 'rated' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `True`, the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged, and 'rated' has been printed to the console.**
