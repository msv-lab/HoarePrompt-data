The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The input integer `n` represents the number of participants. The initial sequences of ratings before and after the round are not changed, but now we have a specific value for `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: there are two sequences of `n` integers where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the first sequence represents the ratings of `n` participants before a round and the second sequence represents the ratings of the same participants after the round, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings, `n` is an input integer.
