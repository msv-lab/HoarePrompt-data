To calculate the result, we should consider the impact of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

The given code is `break`. This statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional statement. The values of the variables do not change when a `break` statement is executed. 

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`.

After executing the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain the same. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
