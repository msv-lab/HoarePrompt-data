Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. If `is_rated` is `True`, then the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged and 'rated' has been printed to the console. If `is_rated` is `False`, then if `is_unrated` is `True`, 'unrated' has been printed to the console; otherwise, 'maybe' has been printed to the console.**
