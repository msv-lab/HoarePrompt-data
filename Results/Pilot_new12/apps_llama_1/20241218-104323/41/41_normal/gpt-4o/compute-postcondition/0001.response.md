The code initializes an empty list `ratings`. The initial state mentions two sequences of `n` integers, but it does not explicitly state that these sequences are stored in any specific variables. However, with the introduction of `ratings`, we now have a specific variable that can potentially hold some form of rating information, even though it starts as an empty list.

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and there are two sequences of `n` integers representing ratings before and after a round, the introduction of `ratings` as an empty list does not directly impact the existence or the values of these sequences unless explicitly used to store or modify them. However, since `ratings` is now part of the state, we include it in the output.

The states of `n` and the two sequences of ratings (before and after the round) are not affected by the initialization of `ratings`. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and the two sequences of `n` integers representing the ratings before and after the round remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, there are two sequences of `n` integers representing ratings before and after a round, and `ratings` is an empty list.**
