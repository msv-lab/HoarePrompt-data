The code sets `is_unrated` to `False`. The initial state has `n` as a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, two sequences of `n` integers representing ratings before and after a round, `ratings` as an empty list, and `is_rated` as `False`. Since the code does not affect `n`, the sequences of ratings, `ratings`, or `is_rated`, their states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, there are two sequences of `n` integers representing ratings before and after a round, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`**
