You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: there are two sequences of n integers where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the first sequence represents the ratings of n participants before a round and the second sequence represents the ratings of the same participants after the round, and the participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `True` if any pair of integers in `ratings` are not equal, otherwise `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `True` if any rating's first element is greater than the previous one, otherwise `is_unrated` is `False`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. If `is_rated` is `False`, then `is_unrated` is `True` if any rating's first element is greater than the previous one, otherwise `is_unrated` is `False`. If `is_rated` is `True`, then the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers, `is_rated` is `False`. If `is_unrated` is `True`, then 'unrated' has been printed to the console. If `is_unrated` is `False`, then 'maybe' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. If `is_rated` is `True`, then the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged and 'rated' has been printed to the console. If `is_rated` is `False`, then if `is_unrated` is `True`, 'unrated' has been printed to the console; otherwise, 'maybe' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function uses two sequences of n integers representing ratings before and after a round, but the exact return value is unknown.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
