Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing three tuples, the first two tuples are the initial tuples, the third tuple is `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are input integers, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify it.***
