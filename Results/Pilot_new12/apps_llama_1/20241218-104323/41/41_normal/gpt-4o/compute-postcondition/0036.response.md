Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a pair of integers. If `is_rated` is `False`, then `is_unrated` is `True` if any rating's first element is greater than the previous one, otherwise `is_unrated` is `False`. If `is_rated` is `True`, then the state of `is_unrated` remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
