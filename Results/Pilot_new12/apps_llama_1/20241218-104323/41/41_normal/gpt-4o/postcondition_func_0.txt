The function takes two sequences of n integers as input, representing ratings before and after a round, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. It checks if any participant's rating has changed and if the initial ratings are in descending order. The function then prints one of three possible outcomes: 'rated' if any rating has changed, 'unrated' if the ratings are in ascending order and no rating has changed, or 'maybe' if the ratings are in descending order and no rating has changed. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the outcome to the console. The input sequences are not modified by the function. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when n is 2 or greater, and when the input sequences are valid or invalid. However, the function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will always be valid.
