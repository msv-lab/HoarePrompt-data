You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program seems to be correct as it follows the problem description accurately. It first checks if any participant's rating has changed. If a change is found, it immediately sets `is_rated` to `True` and prints 'rated' at the end.

If no rating changes are found, it checks if any participant with a lower rating took a better place than a participant with a higher rating. If such a case is found, it sets `is_unrated` to `True` and prints 'unrated' at the end.

If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'maybe', indicating that it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.

The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including when the round is rated for sure, when it's unrated for sure, and when it's impossible to determine whether it's rated or not.

The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with this program. For instance, in the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, so the program correctly prints 'rated'. In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has a lower rating than the participant in the fourth place, so the program correctly prints 'unrated'. In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating, so the program correctly prints 'maybe'.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all the provided examples and edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes two sequences of n integers as input, representing ratings before and after a round, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. It checks if any participant's rating has changed and if the initial ratings are in descending order. The function then prints one of three possible outcomes: 'rated' if any rating has changed, 'unrated' if the ratings are in ascending order and no rating has changed, or 'maybe' if the ratings are in descending order and no rating has changed. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the outcome to the console. The input sequences are not modified by the function. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when n is 2 or greater, and when the input sequences are valid or invalid. However, the function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will always be valid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
