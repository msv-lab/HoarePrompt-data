Postcondition: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `maybe` is True, `rated` is False, `i` is `n-1`, and for all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`. The current value of `unrated` is True, indicating that no participant has a lower rating before but a higher rating after.**
