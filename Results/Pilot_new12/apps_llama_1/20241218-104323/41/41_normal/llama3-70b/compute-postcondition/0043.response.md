According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3. The loop condition is `j` in range(`i` + 1, `n`), so for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.
