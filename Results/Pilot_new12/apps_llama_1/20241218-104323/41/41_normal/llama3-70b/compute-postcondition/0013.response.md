The code appends the value of `a` to the `ratings_before` list. The initial state of `ratings_before` is a list containing two input integers `a`, and the initial state of `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integers `b` and `b`. The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `ratings_before` is a list containing three input integers `a`, `a`, and the input integer `a` that was appended, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integers `b` and `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
