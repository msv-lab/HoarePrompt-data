Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `maybe` is True, `rated` is False, `i` is `n-1`, and for all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`. If `unrated` is True, 'unrated' has been printed to the console. If `unrated` is False, there exists at least one participant who has a lower rating before but a higher rating after, and 'maybe' has been printed to the console.***
