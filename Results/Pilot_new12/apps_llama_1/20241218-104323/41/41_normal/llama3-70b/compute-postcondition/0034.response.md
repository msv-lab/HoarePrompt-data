Postcondition: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers. The current value of `unrated` is False, meaning there exists a `j` such that `ratings_before[0] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[0] > ratings_after[j]`.**
