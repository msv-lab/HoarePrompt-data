To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the limit `n`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has already executed once.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
4. The state of `n` remains the same as it is the loop limit and does not change within the loop. However, since `i` is now 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

Considering these points, we adjust the states as follows:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`rated`, `maybe`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, and `unrated`) are not directly affected by the loop control statement itself but by the loop body, which is not shown. Therefore, their states are not adjusted based solely on the loop statement provided.

State: **`n` is between 3 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `unrated` is True**
