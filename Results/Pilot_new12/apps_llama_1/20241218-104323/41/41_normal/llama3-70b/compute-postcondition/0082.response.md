Postcondition: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `i` is 1, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is True if no participant has a lower rating before but a higher rating after, otherwise `unrated` is False, and if `ratings_before` at index `i` is not equal to `ratings_after` at index `i`, then `rated` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `rated` remains unchanged.**
