The code initializes an empty list `ratings_before`. This operation does not affect the number of participants or their ratings. The value of `n` is also unchanged as it is not referenced in the code.

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, and `ratings_before` is an empty list.**
