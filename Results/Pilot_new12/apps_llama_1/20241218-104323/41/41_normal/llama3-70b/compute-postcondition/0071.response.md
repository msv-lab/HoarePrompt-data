The `break` statement terminates the loop that it is currently inside. However, since there is no information about the loop it is breaking out of, we can only conclude that it breaks out of the most internal loop. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is between 3 and 1000, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` contain `n` input integers, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
