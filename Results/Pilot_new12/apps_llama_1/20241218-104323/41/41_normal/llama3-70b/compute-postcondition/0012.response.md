The code assigns the input integers to variables `a` and `b`. The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than 2. The lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are updated with the input integers `a` and `b`.

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `ratings_before` is a list containing two input integers `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integers `b` and `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
