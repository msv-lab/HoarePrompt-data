According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. However, after each iteration, the loop counter (although not explicitly stated) is implicitly incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, because one iteration has already been completed.
