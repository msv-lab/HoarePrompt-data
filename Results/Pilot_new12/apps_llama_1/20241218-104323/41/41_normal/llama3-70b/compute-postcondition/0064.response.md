Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `j` is 4. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
