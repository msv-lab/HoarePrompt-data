Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `i` is 0. If the value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is not equal to the value of `ratings_after` at index `i`, then `rated` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. `maybe` is True, and `unrated` is True if no participant has a lower rating before but a higher rating after, otherwise `unrated` is False.***
