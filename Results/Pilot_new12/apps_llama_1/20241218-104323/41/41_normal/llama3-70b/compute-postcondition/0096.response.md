Postcondition: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `maybe` is True. If `rated` is True, `i` is the index of the first inconsistent rating, the string 'rated' has been printed to the console, and at least one `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`. If `rated` is False, `i` is `n-1`, and for all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`. In the case of `rated` being False, if `unrated` is True, 'unrated' has been printed to the console; otherwise, 'maybe' has been printed to the console because there exists at least one participant who has a lower rating before but a higher rating after.**
