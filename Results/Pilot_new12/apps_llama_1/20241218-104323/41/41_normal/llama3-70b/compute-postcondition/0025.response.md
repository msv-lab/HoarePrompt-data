To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, n):`, which means `j` will take values from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the number of participants `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range `(i + 1, n)`. 

However, the key here is understanding that the loop is driven by `j` taking on values from `i + 1` up to but not including `n`, but the value of `j` itself does not dictate the termination of the loop in this context since it's `j` that's being iterated. The critical point is whether there are more elements to iterate over based on `n` and the current value of `i`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `j` starts from `i + 1 = 1`, for the loop to execute one more time after the initial iteration (where `j` is 1), `j` must move to the next integer, which is 2, assuming `n` is at least 3 to allow for another iteration.

The state of `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` remains unchanged as per the problem description if the condition regarding ratings is not met, which means `rated` is still False, `unrated` is still True, and `maybe` is still True.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, considering `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again after the first iteration:
State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True**
