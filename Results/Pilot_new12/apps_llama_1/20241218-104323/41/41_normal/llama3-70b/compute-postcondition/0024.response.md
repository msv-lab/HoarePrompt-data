Postcondition: ***The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If this condition is not met, then the state of `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` remains unchanged as `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True.***
