Postcondition: **the number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, if `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state remains unchanged with `rated` being False and `maybe` being True, and `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers.**
