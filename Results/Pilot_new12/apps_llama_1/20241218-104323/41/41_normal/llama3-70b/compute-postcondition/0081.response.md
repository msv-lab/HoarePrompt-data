The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `i` is 1, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is True if no participant has a lower rating before but a higher rating after, otherwise `unrated` is False, `rated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
