The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop. Since there's no assignment or modification of variables within this statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The loop that this `break` statement is part of is exited, but without additional context about the loop structure, we can only conclude that the execution moves out of the current loop scope.

Output State: **The number of participants `n` is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
