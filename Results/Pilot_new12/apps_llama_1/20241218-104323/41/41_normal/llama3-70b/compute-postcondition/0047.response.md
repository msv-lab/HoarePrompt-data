According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range `i + 1` to `n`. So, `j` becomes 4. Since `j` is now 4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.
