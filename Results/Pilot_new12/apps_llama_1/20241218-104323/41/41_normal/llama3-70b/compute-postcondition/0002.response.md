The code initializes an empty list `ratings_after`. The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, and each participant's rating is a positive integer. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `ratings_before` is an empty list. 

Since `ratings_after` is initialized as an empty list, its state is now defined. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is an empty list, and `ratings_after` is an empty list.**
