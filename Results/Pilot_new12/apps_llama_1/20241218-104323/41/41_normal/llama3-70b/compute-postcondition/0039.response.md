Postcondition: **the number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`. `unrated` is True or False depending on the condition**
