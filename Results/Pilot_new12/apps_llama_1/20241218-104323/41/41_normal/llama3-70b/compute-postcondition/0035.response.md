The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: the number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
