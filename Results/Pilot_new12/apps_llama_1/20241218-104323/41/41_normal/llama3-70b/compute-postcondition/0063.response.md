The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is False, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `j` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
