Postcondition: ***`n` is between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `j` will start at 3. If the current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`, then `unrated` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
