Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `i` is 2, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is True if no participant has a lower rating before but a higher rating after, otherwise `unrated` is False. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then no changes are made.***
