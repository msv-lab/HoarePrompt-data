The given code snippet accepts two input integers and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. 

The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1. These conditions are not affected by the given code snippet.

`ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`. After the code execution, `a` and `b` will be updated to the new input integers.

The updated values of `a` and `b` are input integers. 

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
