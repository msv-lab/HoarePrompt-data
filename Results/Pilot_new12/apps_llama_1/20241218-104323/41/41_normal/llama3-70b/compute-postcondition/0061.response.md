According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` will start at 3, and `n` is between 4 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` is 4. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 4. The states of `rated`, `maybe`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` remain unchanged as there is no else part and no information suggests their modification. 
State: **`n` is between 4 and 1000, `i` is 2, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `j` is 4**
