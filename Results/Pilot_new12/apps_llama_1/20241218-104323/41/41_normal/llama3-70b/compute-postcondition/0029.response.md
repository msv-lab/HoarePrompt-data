According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The loop condition is `j` in range from `i + 1` to `n`, so for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.
