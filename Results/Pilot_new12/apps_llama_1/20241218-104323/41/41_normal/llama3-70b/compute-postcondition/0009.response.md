The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1. `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. 

`ratings_before` initially is a list containing the input integer `a`, and after executing the code, it becomes a list containing the input integers `a` and `a` (since `a` is appended to itself).

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing two input integers `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
