The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. 

The number of participants is still between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0. The list `ratings_before` is no longer empty and now contains the input integer `a`. The list `ratings_after` is still empty.

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
