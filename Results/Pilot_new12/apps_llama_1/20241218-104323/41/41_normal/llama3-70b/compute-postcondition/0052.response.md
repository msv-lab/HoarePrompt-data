Postcondition: **The number of participants `n` is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `i` is 1, initially `rated` is False, initially `maybe` is True, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers. The current value of `unrated` is False, meaning there exists a participant `j` where `ratings_before[1] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[1] > ratings_after[j]`.**
