Postcondition: **the number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `rated` is False, `maybe` is True, `unrated` is False, and if `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.**
