To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is between 2 and 1000.
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers.
- `maybe` is True.
- `rated` is False.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- For all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`.
- `unrated` is True.

Given Code:
```python
print('unrated')
```

This code simply prints the string 'unrated' to the console. It does not modify the state of any variables.

Output State:
- `n` is between 2 and 1000.
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers.
- `maybe` is True.
- `rated` is False.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- For all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`.
- `unrated` is True.
- The string 'unrated' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` input integers, `maybe` is True, `rated` is False, `i` is `n-1`, for all indices `j` in range `n`, `ratings_before[j]` is equal to `ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` is True, and 'unrated' has been printed to the console.**
