The code appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing two input integers `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer.

After executing the code, `ratings_after` will be a list containing the input integer `b` appended with another `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing two input integers `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integers `b` and `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**.
