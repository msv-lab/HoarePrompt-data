The code appends the value `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2. The list `ratings_before` contains three input integers `a`, `a`, and `a`. The list `ratings_after` initially contains two input integers `b` and `b`. After appending `b` to `ratings_after`, it now contains three `b`s. 

Output State: **The number of participants is between 2 and 1000, each participant's rating is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `ratings_before` is a list containing three input integers `a`, `a`, and `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing three input integers `b`, `b`, and `b`, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer**
