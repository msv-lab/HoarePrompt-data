You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input

1 10

Output
YES
4 9



-----Note-----

The matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] 

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False** 

The provided Python program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One of the issues with the program is that it only checks for a limited number of possible values of `x` and `y` (up to 1000001), whereas the problem description states that `x` and `y` can be up to 10^9. This means that the program may miss potential solutions for larger values of `x` and `y`.

Another issue is that the program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible values of `x` and `y`, which can be inefficient and may cause the program to run indefinitely for large inputs.

Additionally, the program uses a function `func_1(x, y)` that checks if the given path is valid for the given `x` and `y`. However, this function only checks if the path is valid in terms of moving to adjacent cells, but it does not check if the path is valid in terms of the given sequence of integers.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to efficiently search for possible values of `x` and `y` up to 10^9, and to correctly validate the given path for each pair of `x` and `y`.

Here's an example of an input that the program may not work correctly for:
```
2
1 1000001
```
The program will not find a solution for this input because it only checks up to `x` and `y` of 1000001, but the correct solution is `x = 1` and `y = 1000001`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more efficient algorithm is needed that can handle large values of `x` and `y`. One possible approach is to use a mathematical approach to find the possible values of `x` and `y` based on the given sequence of integers. 

Here's an example of how the correct code could be implemented:
```python
def find_x_y(a):
    for x in range(1, int(max(a)**0.5) + 1):
        if max(a) % x == 0:
            y = max(a) // x
            if is_valid_path(a, x, y):
                return x, y
    return None

def is_valid_path(a, x, y):
    dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
    dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
    pos = [(v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y] for v in a]
    for i in range(1, len(pos)):
        if abs(pos[i][0] - pos[i-1][0]) + abs(pos[i][1] - pos[i-1][1])!= 1:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

solution = find_x_y(a)
if solution:
    print('YES')
    print(solution[0], solution[1])
else:
    print('NO')
```
This code correctly finds the possible values of `x` and `y` for the given sequence of integers, and checks if the given path is valid for each pair of `x` and `y`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers representing the dimensions of a matrix, where every integer from 1 to xy occurs exactly once in the matrix, and the values in the matrix are determined by the formula A_{i, j} = y(i - 1) + j.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are positive integers, `px` and `py` are the final coordinates based on the last element of `a` if the loop completes, `a` is a list representing a valid path in the matrix if the loop completes without returning False.
    return True
    #The program returns boolean value True


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
