Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the loop that checks all possible values of x and y. The loop only checks for x and y up to 1000001, which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases as the problem statement specifies that x and y can be up to 10^9. This means that there can be valid x and y values that are not being checked, resulting in the program potentially printing 'NO' when a valid solution exists.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input list a is empty. In this case, the function func_1 will throw an error when trying to access the elements of a.

Another issue with the code is that it does not check if the list a contains all integers from 1 to xy. This is a requirement specified in the problem description, and the code should ensure that this condition is met.

The given examples do not cover these edge cases, but they are still potential issues with the code that need to be addressed. To fix the code, the loop should be modified to check all possible values of x and y up to 10^9, and the code should be updated to handle the case where the input list a is empty and to check if the list a contains all integers from 1 to xy. 

For example, the input:
10
1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 100000000 1000000000 
will not be handled correctly by the code, because the code does not check all possible values of x and y up to 10^9. 

This input will cause the code to print 'NO', but a valid solution exists: x = 31622776, y = 31622776. 

This shows that the code does not work correctly for every potential case, and therefore the correctness is False.
