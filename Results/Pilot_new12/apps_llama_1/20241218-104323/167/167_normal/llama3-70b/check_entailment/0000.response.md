Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not work correctly for every potential case. 

One major issue with the code is that it only checks for `x` and `y` up to 1,000,000, whereas the problem statement allows `x` and `y` to be up to 10^9. This means that for larger values of `x` and `y`, the program may not find a valid solution even if one exists.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case where the input sequence `a` contains duplicate values. The `func_1` function checks if the absolute difference between the current and previous positions is 1, but this does not account for the case where the previous position is the same as the current position (i.e., a duplicate value in the sequence).

Another issue is that the program does not check if `x * y` is equal to the maximum value in `a`. According to the problem description, every integer from 1 to `x * y` occurs exactly once in the matrix. So, the program should check if `x * y` is equal to the maximum value in `a`.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to check for all possible values of `x` and `y` up to 10^9, handle duplicate values in the input sequence, and check if `x * y` is equal to the maximum value in `a`. 

Here is an example of input that the program does not handle correctly:
```
2
1 1000001
```
In this case, the program should print "YES" and a valid solution for `x` and `y`, but it does not because it only checks up to `x` and `y` of 1,000,000. A valid solution for this input is `x = 1` and `y = 1000001`, or `x = 1000001` and `y = 1`.
