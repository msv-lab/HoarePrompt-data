Correctness: **False**.

The code seems to be mostly correct, but it has a few potential issues. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the list `a` is empty. Although we assume that the input will be valid, this is still an edge case that could potentially cause issues.

Another potential issue is that the code only checks if the path represented by `a` is valid for matrices where `x * y > max(a)`. If `x * y` is equal to `max(a)`, the code will not check this case, even though it could potentially be a valid solution.

Additionally, the code uses a brute force approach to check all possible values of `x` and `y`, which could be inefficient for large inputs.

A more significant issue is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the input list `a` contains duplicate elements. The function `func_1` checks if the absolute difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of two consecutive elements in `a` is equal to 1, which is correct for a path in a matrix. However, if the list `a` contains duplicate elements, this check will fail, even if the path is valid.

For example, if the input is `n = 2` and `a = [1, 1]`, the function `func_1` will return `False`, even though this path is valid for a matrix of size 1x1.

Overall, while the code seems to be mostly correct, it has several potential issues that could cause it to fail for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
