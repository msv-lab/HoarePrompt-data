Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input as specified: it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`.

2. The program checks all possible values of `x` and `y` such that `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6` (which is a reasonable limit considering the input size) to see if the given path `a` can be valid in a matrix of size `x × y`.

3. For each `x` and `y`, the program checks if `x * y` is greater than the maximum value in `a`. If it is, it breaks the loop for the current `x` because `x * y` cannot be smaller than any value in `a` if the path is valid.

4. If `x * y` is not greater than the maximum value in `a`, the program checks if all values in `a` are within the range `[1, x * y]` and if the path `a` is valid in the matrix of size `x × y` using the `func_1` function.

5. The `func_1` function checks if the path `a` is valid by ensuring that each consecutive pair of elements in `a` corresponds to adjacent cells in the matrix. It does this by calculating the coordinates of each element in `a` based on the formula `A_{i, j} = y(i - 1) + j` and checking if the Manhattan distance between each pair of consecutive coordinates is 1.

6. If the program finds an `x` and `y` for which the path `a` is valid, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.

7. If the program checks all possible values of `x` and `y` without finding a valid path, it prints "NO".

The program assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, which is specified in the problem description. It correctly implements the problem description and should work correctly for all valid inputs.
