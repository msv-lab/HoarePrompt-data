Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` may have changed, `py` may have changed, `a` has at least two elements, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and `v` is the next element in the list `a`. If `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are specified.***
