Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, initially `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `a` is not empty, `nx` is the integer part of `(v - 1)` divided by `y`, `ny` is the remainder of `(v - 1)` divided by `y`. The current value of `nx` is `(v - 1) // y` and the current value of `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`. The sum of the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` and the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.**
