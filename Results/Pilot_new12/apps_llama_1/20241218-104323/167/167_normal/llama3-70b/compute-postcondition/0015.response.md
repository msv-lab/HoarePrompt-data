Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `a` has at least one more element, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, `v` is the next element in the list `a`, `px` is `(next_v - 1) // y`, and `py` is `(next_v - 1) % y`. If the sum of the absolute differences between `nx` and `px` and between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
