The code `px, py = nx, ny` assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py` respectively. 

Given that `nx` is `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, we now have `px` = `(v - 1) // y` and `py` = `(v - 1) % y`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` was initially equals 1, but now since `px` equals `nx` and `py` equals `ny`, this sum equals 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` must not be empty, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` equals 0.
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` must not be empty, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, and the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` equals 0**
