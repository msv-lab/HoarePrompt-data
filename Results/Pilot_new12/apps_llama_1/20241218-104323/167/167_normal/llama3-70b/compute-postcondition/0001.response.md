According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `px` is 0, `py` is 0. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. 

State: **`x` and `y` are positive integers, `px` is 0, `py` is 0, `a` must not be empty**
