Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three real numbers from the input, calculates the values of the 12 expressions, and prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input**: The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and `map(float, input().split())`, which splits the input into three space-separated real numbers and converts them to float.

2. **Expressions**: The program defines the 12 expressions as specified in the problem description and stores them in the `expressions` list along with their corresponding string representations.

3. **Maximum Value**: The program uses the `max` function with a lambda function as the key to find the maximum value and its corresponding expression. The lambda function `lambda pair: pair[0]` specifies that the maximum value should be determined based on the first element of each pair (i.e., the value of the expression).

4. **Output**: The program prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value, which is the first expression that achieves the maximum value in the case of a tie.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, assuming valid input. It does not contain any syntax errors or logical mistakes. It correctly calculates the expressions and finds the maximum value, and it prints the corresponding expression as required by the problem description.
