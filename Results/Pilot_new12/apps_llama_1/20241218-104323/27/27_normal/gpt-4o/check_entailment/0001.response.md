Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem. It calculates all 12 possible expressions and finds the maximum value, then prints the corresponding expression.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. It correctly reads the input values `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input line.
2. It calculates all 12 expressions as specified in the problem description.
3. It uses the `max` function with a `lambda` function as the key to find the maximum value and the corresponding expression.
4. It correctly prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value.

I've reviewed the code and couldn't find any potential cases where it would not work as expected. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

Some potential edge cases to consider are:

* When `x`, `y`, or `z` are close to 0.1 or 200.0, the program still works correctly.
* When `x`, `y`, or `z` are equal, the program still finds the correct maximum value and prints the corresponding expression.
* When the maximum value is achieved by multiple expressions, the program still prints the first one it encounters, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as expected.
