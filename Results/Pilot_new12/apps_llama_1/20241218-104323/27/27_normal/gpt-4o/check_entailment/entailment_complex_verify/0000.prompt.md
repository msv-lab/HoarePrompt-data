You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity). 


-----Examples-----
Input
1.1 3.4 2.5

Output
z^y^x

Input
2.0 2.0 2.0

Output
x^y^z

Input
1.9 1.8 1.7

Output
(x^y)^z
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (x, y, z) = map(float, input().split())
    expressions = [(x ** y ** z, 'x^y^z'), (x ** z ** y, 'x^z^y'), ((x ** y) ** z, '(x^y)^z'), ((x ** z) ** y, '(x^z)^y'), (y ** x ** z, 'y^x^z'), (y ** z ** x, 'y^z^x'), ((y ** x) ** z, '(y^x)^z'), ((y ** z) ** x, '(y^z)^x'), (z ** x ** y, 'z^x^y'), (z ** y ** x, 'z^y^x'), ((z ** x) ** y, '(z^x)^y'), ((z ** y) ** x, '(z^y)^x')]
    (max_value, max_expr) = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    print(max_expr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of x, y, and z from the standard input.
2. It defines a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the result of an expression (calculated using the input values) and a string representing the corresponding expression.
3. The program uses the built-in max function with a lambda function as the key to find the tuple with the maximum value.
4. It then prints the string representation of the expression that corresponds to the maximum value.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- When there are multiple maximum values, it prints the one that comes first in the list.
- When the input values are at the boundaries of the specified range (0.1 to 200.0).
- When the input values are equal to each other.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all possible cases, it is correct. 

In order to be sure, it is possible to add some test cases to verify the correctness of the program. For instance:

```python
import math
import unittest

def func_1(x, y, z):
    expressions = [(x ** y ** z, 'x^y^z'), (x ** z ** y, 'x^z^y'), ((x ** y) ** z, '(x^y)^z'), ((x ** z) ** y, '(x^z)^y'), (y ** x ** z, 'y^x^z'), (y ** z ** x, 'y^z^x'), ((y ** x) ** z, '(y^x)^z'), ((y ** z) ** x, '(y^z)^x'), (z ** x ** y, 'z^x^y'), (z ** y ** x, 'z^y^x'), ((z ** x) ** y, '(z^x)^y'), ((z ** y) ** x, '(z^y)^x')]
    (max_value, max_expr) = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    return max_expr

class TestFunc1(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_func_1(self):
        self.assertEqual(func_1(1.1, 3.4, 2.5), 'z^y^x')
        self.assertEqual(func_1(2.0, 2.0, 2.0), 'x^y^z')
        self.assertEqual(func_1(1.9, 1.8, 1.7), '(x^y)^z')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
These test cases can help verify the correctness of the program.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, where 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, y, and z has exactly one digit after the decimal point.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
    expressions = [(x ** y ** z, 'x^y^z'), (x ** z ** y, 'x^z^y'), ((x ** y) **
    z, '(x^y)^z'), ((x ** z) ** y, '(x^z)^y'), (y ** x ** z, 'y^x^z'), (y **
    z ** x, 'y^z^x'), ((y ** x) ** z, '(y^x)^z'), ((y ** z) ** x, '(y^z)^x'
    ), (z ** x ** y, 'z^x^y'), (z ** y ** x, 'z^y^x'), ((z ** x) ** y,
    '(z^x)^y'), ((z ** y) ** x, '(z^y)^x')]
    max_value, max_expr = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    print(max_expr)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input from the standard input, where `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0` and each has exactly one digit after the decimal point. It calculates 12 different expressions involving exponentiation of these numbers, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the corresponding mathematical expression as a string. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. After execution, the program will have printed the expression that resulted in the maximum calculated value, but the original input values `x`, `y`, and `z` will remain unchanged. The function's output will be one of the 12 predefined expressions, but it does not provide any additional information about the calculated maximum value itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
