#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, where 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, y, and z has exactly one digit after the decimal point.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input from the standard input, where `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0` and each has exactly one digit after the decimal point. It calculates 12 different expressions involving exponentiation of these numbers, finds the maximum value among them, and prints the corresponding mathematical expression as a string. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. After execution, the program will have printed the expression that resulted in the maximum calculated value, but the original input values `x`, `y`, and `z` will remain unchanged. The function's output will be one of the 12 predefined expressions, but it does not provide any additional information about the calculated maximum value itself.
