The function `func_1` does not explicitly state the parameters it accepts, but based on the given constraints, it seems to accept three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, where `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`, and each of `x`, `y`, and `z` has exactly one digit after the decimal point. 

However, since the function definition provided is `def func_1():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. In a typical Python function, parameters would be defined within the parentheses, like `def func_1(x, y, z):`. 

Given the information provided and the explicit lack of parameters in the function definition, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or a need for clarification in the problem statement regarding how `x`, `y`, and `z` are passed to `func_1`. 

For the purpose of providing an answer based on the format requested, and considering a potentially implied input method (such as global variables or an undefined input mechanism within `func_1`), we proceed under the assumption that `func_1` operates on the described `x`, `y`, and `z` values, which are real numbers with specific constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with constraints `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0` and each having exactly one digit after the decimal point, but the exact mechanism of acceptance is not defined in the provided function definition; thus, its intended return value cannot be directly inferred without additional context.**
