The `input` function reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and returns it as a string. The `split` method splits this string into a list of substrings separated by spaces, and `map(float,...)` converts each substring to a floating-point number. 

The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third floating-point numbers in the input, respectively. The preconditions state that each of `x`, `y`, and `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0.

Output State: **`x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point**
