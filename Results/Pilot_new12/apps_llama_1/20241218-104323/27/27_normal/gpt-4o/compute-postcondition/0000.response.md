The given code line `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. The `sys.stdin.read` function reads from standard input until the end of the file is reached.

Output State: **The input consists of three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, where 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, y, and z has exactly one digit after the decimal point. The variable `input` now holds the function `sys.stdin.read`.**
