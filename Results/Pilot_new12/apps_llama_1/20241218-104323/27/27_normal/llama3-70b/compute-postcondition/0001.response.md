The code `a1 = x ** y ** z` calculates the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z` and assigns it to `a1`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, within the range 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0.

The value of `a1` is assigned the result of `x ** (y ** z)`, given the order of operations in Python. 

The states of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected, so they remain real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, within the range 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, within the range 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0, and `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, within the range 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0, and `a1` is equal to `x ** (y ** z)`**
