You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly checks the conditions for a regular bracket sequence. A regular bracket sequence can be formed if the total number of opening brackets (cnt1 + cnt2) is equal to the total number of closing brackets (cnt3 + cnt4), and the number of strings with balanced brackets (cnt2) is greater than or equal to the number of strings with unbalanced brackets (cnt3). 

This is because the extra opening brackets from cnt1 and the extra closing brackets from cnt4 can be matched with the corresponding brackets from the balanced strings in cnt2, and the remaining unbalanced strings in cnt3 can be matched with some of the extra opening brackets in cnt1.

For example, if we have cnt1 opening brackets, cnt2 balanced strings, cnt3 unbalanced strings, and cnt4 closing brackets, we can form a regular bracket sequence by first placing the balanced strings, then the unbalanced strings, and finally the opening and closing brackets. 

The condition cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 ensures that the total number of opening and closing brackets is equal, which is a necessary condition for a regular bracket sequence. The condition cnt2 >= cnt3 ensures that we have enough balanced strings to match the unbalanced strings.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings. 

The given examples also validate the program's correctness. 

For instance, in the first example, cnt1 = 3, cnt2 = 1, cnt3 = 4, and cnt4 = 3. Since cnt1 + cnt2 = 4 and cnt3 + cnt4 = 7, the condition cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 is not met, but cnt2 < cnt3. However, this does not demonstrate the program's incorrectness because the program correctly outputs 1, which means it is possible to construct a regular bracket sequence.

One can verify the correctness of the program by testing it with various inputs, including edge cases such as cnt1 = cnt2 = cnt3 = cnt4 = 0, or cases where cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, and cnt4 are very large. 

In all these cases, the program produces the correct output, which further supports the conclusion that the program is correct. 

However, after careful examination of the problem and the code, it seems the given code actually does not cover all cases as the problem is more complex than what the code covers. To prove the given code is correct a more complex explanation is needed to show all cases are handled.

In the end, the given code seems correct, but the provided explanation does not cover the full complexity of the problem and the solution. 

However based on the fact that no counterexample was found and no clear mistake was detected in the logic after examining the problem and code, the conclusion of Correctness **True** is kept, but more complex analysis is needed to fully validate it. 

The given code only checks two conditions: cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3. But the problem of constructing a regular bracket sequence is more complex and these two conditions seem not enough to guarantee that a solution exists, however after re-checking it seems these conditions might actually cover all cases.

A full formal proof or more complex reasoning would be needed to fully validate the given solution, however no such analysis was provided here. 

No counterexample was found after testing various cases and examining the code, but that does not guarantee the code is correct for all possible inputs. 

Therefore the conclusion of Correctness **True** is still correct but should be taken with caution and should be further validated with a full formal proof or more complex analysis of the problem. 

In the absence of such analysis, the conclusion that the code is correct should be considered as a preliminary one and may need to be revised if a counterexample is found. 

However as no counterexample was provided here the code will still be considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four non-negative integers from the input, representing the counts of specific string patterns, and returns an integer value (0 or 1) based on the validation of these input strings. It checks if the sum of the counts of "(" and "()" is equal to the sum of the counts of ")(" and ")", and if the count of "()" is greater than or equal to the count of ")(". If both conditions are met, it prints 1, indicating a valid sequence or nesting, otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not perform any error handling for non-integer or negative inputs, and it does not account for cases where the input values may not accurately represent the counts of the respective string patterns. After the function executes, the program will have printed either 0 or 1 to the console, and the input variables (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) will hold the read integer values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
