Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions required to form a regular bracket sequence from the given strings.

The problem description states that a bracket sequence is regular if it is possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into the sequence. For a sequence of length $2n$ to be regular, it must have $n$ opening brackets and $n$ closing brackets.

In the given program, the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` checks if the total number of opening brackets (`cnt1 + cnt2`) is equal to the total number of closing brackets (`cnt3 + cnt4`). This ensures that the resulting bracket sequence has an equal number of opening and closing brackets, which is a necessary condition for it to be regular.

The additional condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` is also necessary because each string "()" contributes one opening and one closing bracket, while each string ")(" contributes one closing and one opening bracket. If `cnt2 < cnt3`, it would mean that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets at some point in the sequence, which would make it irregular.

By checking both conditions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings. If both conditions are met, the program prints 1, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. Otherwise, it prints 0.

Therefore, the program accurately implements the problem description and is correct.
