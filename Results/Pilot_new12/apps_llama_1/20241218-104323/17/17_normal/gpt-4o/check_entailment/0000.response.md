Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The program checks two conditions to determine if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence:

1. `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`: This condition ensures that the total number of opening brackets (`cnt1` and `cnt2`) is equal to the total number of closing brackets (`cnt3` and `cnt4`). This is a necessary condition for a regular bracket sequence.

2. `cnt2 >= cnt3`: This condition ensures that there are enough strings of the form `()` to balance out the strings of the form `)(`. If `cnt2 < cnt3`, then there would be more closing brackets than opening brackets in the middle of the sequence, which would make it impossible to form a regular bracket sequence.

The program prints `1` if both conditions are met, and `0` otherwise. This logic is correct and covers all possible cases.

I have not found any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
