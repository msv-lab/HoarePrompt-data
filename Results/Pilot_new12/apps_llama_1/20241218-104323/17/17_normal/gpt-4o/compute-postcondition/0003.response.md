The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `cnt4`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer.
Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer**
