The function `func` accepts no arguments but reads four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` from the input. 

To formulate the return value, we must first understand the input parameters:
- `cnt_1` represents the number of strings "(",
- `cnt_2` represents the number of strings "()",
- `cnt_3` represents the number of strings ")(",
- `cnt_4` represents the number of strings ")" from the input.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact output based on these inputs, let's consider a general approach to describe the functionality based on typical string manipulation and validation tasks involving parentheses.

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integers as input: cnt_1 for "(", cnt_2 for "()", cnt_3 for ")(", and cnt_4 for ")". It returns a value based on the combination and validation of these input strings regarding their correct sequence or nesting.**
