The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `cnt3`. The previous values of `cnt1` and `cnt2` are not affected. The value of `cnt3` is now an input integer. `cnt_4` is still to be read from the input.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is still to be read from the input**
