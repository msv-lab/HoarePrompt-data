Postcondition: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt2` is an integer, `cnt3` is an integer, `cnt4` is an integer. If the sum of `cnt1` and `cnt2` is equal to the sum of `cnt3` and `cnt4`, and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`, then the value 1 has been printed. Otherwise, the value 0 has been printed.**
