The given code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cnt1`. 

Since `cnt1` represents the number of strings "(", its value will be a non-negative integer.

The states of the other variables (`cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are still to be read from the input**
