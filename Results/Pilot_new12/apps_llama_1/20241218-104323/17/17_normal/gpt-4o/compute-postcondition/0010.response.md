Functionality: **The function reads four non-negative integers from the input, representing the counts of specific string patterns, and returns an integer value (0 or 1) based on the validation of these input strings. It checks if the sum of the counts of "(" and "()" is equal to the sum of the counts of ")(" and ")", and if the count of "()" is greater than or equal to the count of ")(". If both conditions are met, it prints 1, indicating a valid sequence or nesting, otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not perform any error handling for non-integer or negative inputs, and it does not account for cases where the input values may not accurately represent the counts of the respective string patterns. After the function executes, the program will have printed either 0 or 1 to the console, and the input variables (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) will hold the read integer values.**
