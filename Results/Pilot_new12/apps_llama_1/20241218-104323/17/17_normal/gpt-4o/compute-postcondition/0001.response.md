The code `cnt2 = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to `cnt2`. The previous value of `cnt2` is unknown since it was to be read from the input. The states of the other variables (`cnt1`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4`) are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are still to be read from the input**
