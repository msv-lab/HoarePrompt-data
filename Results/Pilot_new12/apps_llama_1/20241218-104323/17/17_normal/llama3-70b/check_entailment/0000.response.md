Correctness: **False**.

The program does not consider all the necessary conditions to form a regular bracket sequence. It only checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, but it does not consider the total counts of opening and closing brackets. 

A counterexample is when `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 1`. In this case, the program will print `1`, but it is actually impossible to form a regular bracket sequence because there is one extra closing bracket.

To fix this, we need to check if the total count of opening brackets is equal to the total count of closing brackets. The correct condition should be `cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 == cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4`, or equivalently, `cnt1 == cnt4`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt1 <= cnt2 + cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
