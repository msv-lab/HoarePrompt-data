Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when `cnt4 > cnt2` correctly. According to the problem description, a regular bracket sequence can be formed only if it is possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into the sequence. 

In the case when `cnt4 > cnt2`, it means there are more closing parentheses at the beginning of the strings than there are complete pairs of parentheses. This would result in an unbalanced sequence of parentheses, which cannot be made regular by rearranging the strings. However, the given program does not check for this condition and would incorrectly print `1` in such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
0
0
0
1
```
The program would output `1`, but it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence with this input because the extra closing parenthesis at the beginning cannot be balanced. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
