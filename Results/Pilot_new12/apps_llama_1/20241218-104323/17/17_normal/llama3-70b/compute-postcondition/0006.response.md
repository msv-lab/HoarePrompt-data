The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on four non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4, representing the counts of the strings "((", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively.

Given the lack of explicit information on the return value in the provided output section, I will assume a general approach to describe the function's functionality. Typically, a function with such input parameters might be designed to calculate or determine something based on the counts of these specific string patterns.

Without specific details on the return value, we can only describe the function in general terms based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function operates on the counts of four specific string patterns and returns a value based on these counts.**
