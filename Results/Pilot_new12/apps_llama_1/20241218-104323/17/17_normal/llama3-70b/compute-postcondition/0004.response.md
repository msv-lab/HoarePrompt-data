The code provided is a simple print statement that outputs the value 1. This statement does not modify any variables in the program. The variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` retain their original values, and the condition that `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1` remains unchanged.

The output of the program is the value 1, which is printed to the console. However, in terms of the state of the variables, nothing changes.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "(()", `cnt2` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "()", `cnt3` is a non-negative integer representing the count of ")(", `cnt4` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "))", and `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, and the value 1 has been printed.**
