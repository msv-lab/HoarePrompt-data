The given code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the value 0. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The initial state is: `cnt1` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "(()", `cnt2` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "()", `cnt3` is a non-negative integer representing the count of ")(", and `cnt4` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "))". The current value of `cnt3` is greater than the current value of `cnt1`. 

Since the code does not change the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value 0 has been returned at the output.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "(()", `cnt2` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "()", `cnt3` is a non-negative integer representing the count of ")(", `cnt4` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "))", `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, and the value 0 has been returned at the output.**
