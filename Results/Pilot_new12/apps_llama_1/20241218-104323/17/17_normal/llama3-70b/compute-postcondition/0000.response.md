The code assigns the values of four input integers to the variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. These input integers represent the counts of the strings "((", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "(()", `cnt2` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "()", `cnt3` is a non-negative integer representing the count of ")(", and `cnt4` is a non-negative integer representing the count of "))"**
