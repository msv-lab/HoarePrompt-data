Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 1 key, `i` is the first key in `d`, the count of the first key `i` in the dictionary `d` equals half of the value of `n`. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and `c` is 1. If `c` is not 0, then `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
