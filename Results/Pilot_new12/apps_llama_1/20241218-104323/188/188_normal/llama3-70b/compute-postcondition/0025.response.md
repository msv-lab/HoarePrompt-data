The code introduces a new variable `c` and assigns it the value `0`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, and `i` is the last integer in `a`, the code does not change these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` is the last integer in `a`, and `c` is 0.**
