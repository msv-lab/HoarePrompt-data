Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value and `a` has at least one more element, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where if `i` was initially a key in `d` with a value of 2, now `i` is a key with a value of 3, if `i` was initially a key in `d` with a value of 1, now `i` is a key with a value of 2, and if `i` was not initially a key in `d`, now `i` is a key with a value of 1***
