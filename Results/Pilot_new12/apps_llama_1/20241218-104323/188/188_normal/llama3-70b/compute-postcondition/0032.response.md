Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 1 key, `i` is the first key in `d`, the current value of `c` is not equal to 0, the current value of `a1` is -1, and the current value of `a2` is -1. The count of the first key `i` in the dictionary `d` equals half of the value of `n`.**
