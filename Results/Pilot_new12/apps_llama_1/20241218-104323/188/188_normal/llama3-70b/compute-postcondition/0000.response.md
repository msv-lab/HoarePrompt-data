The given code is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`.

Given the initial state that the input consists of a sequence of n integers, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n is even, and each integer is between 1 and 100, we can determine that `n` will hold the value of the number of integers in the sequence.

The value of `n` is determined by the user's input, which is then converted to an integer. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, representing the number of integers in the sequence, each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100, and a sequence of `n` integers is expected as input**
