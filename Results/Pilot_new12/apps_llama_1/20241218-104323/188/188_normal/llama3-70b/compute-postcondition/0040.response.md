The code `a2 = i` creates a new variable `a2` and assigns it the value of `i`, which is the second key in the dictionary `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 2 keys, `i` is the second key in `d`, `a2` is equal to the second key in `d`**
