According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `d`. If `d` has at least 1 key (i.e., a unique integer in `a`), the loop can execute. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` must have at least 1 key. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is the last integer in `a`, but in the loop, `i` will take the value of each key in `d`. So, for the loop to be executed, `i` should be the first key in `d`. 

Other variables like `c`, `a1`, and `a2` do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 1 key, `i` is the first key in `d`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, and `a2` is -1**
