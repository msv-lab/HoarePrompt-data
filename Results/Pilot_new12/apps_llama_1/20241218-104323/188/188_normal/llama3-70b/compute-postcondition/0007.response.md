The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an input integer to the list `a`. The initial state of `a` is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is `n` and the second element is an input integer. After executing the code, `a` will contain three integer elements: the first element is `n`, the second element is the initial input integer, and the third element is the new input integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an even integer between 2 and 100 and greater than 2. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as 2.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 and greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three integer elements where the first element is `n`, the second element is an initial input integer, and the third element is a new input integer, `i` is 2**
