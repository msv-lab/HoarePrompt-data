The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the output. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `i`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the first integer whose count equals `n // 2`, `a2` is the second integer whose count equals `n // 2`, and 'YES' has been printed to the output**
