The `break` statement terminates the loop it is currently inside. However, since there's no loop provided in the code snippet, we'll assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. 

The values of the variables do not change. `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` remains a list of `n` integers, `d` remains a dictionary with at least 3 keys where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` remains the third key in `d`, and `a2` remains equal to the third key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 3 keys, `i` is the third key in `d`, `a2` is equal to the third key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
