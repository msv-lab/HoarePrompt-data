To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in a:
    if i in d:
        d[i] += 1
    else:
        d[i] = 1
```
This loop iterates over the list `a` and updates the dictionary `d` with the count of each integer in `a`.

From the given output states, we can observe the following patterns:

* The value of `n` remains the same, which is an even integer between 2 and 100.
* The list `a` remains the same, which contains `n` integers.
* The dictionary `d` is updated with the count of each integer in `a`.
* The value of `i` is updated to the current integer being processed in the loop.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state can be determined as follows:

* The value of `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100.
* The list `a` is still a list of `n` integers.
* The dictionary `d` contains the count of each integer in `a`. The keys in `d` are the unique integers in `a`, and the values are the counts of each integer.
* The value of `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, which is `a[-1]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., the list `a` is empty), the output state would be:

* The value of `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100, but `n` would be 0 in this case, which contradicts the given initial state. However, considering the initial state, `n` is between 2 and 100, but since `a` is empty, `n` should be 0. In this case, `a` is an empty list, and `d` is an empty dictionary.

Considering the original value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, if the loop does not execute, it means `a` is an empty list, which is not possible given the initial state. However, to cover all cases:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` is the last integer in `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `d` is an empty dictionary and `a` is an empty list, which contradicts the initial state that `n` is between 2 and 100. If we consider the case where `n` is indeed 0 and `a` is empty, then `d` is an empty dictionary.**
