According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already given as an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, this condition is already met. The loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, `a` is an empty list and `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
