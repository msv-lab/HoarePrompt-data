The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Initially, `d` is an empty dictionary and `i` is not a key in `d`. After executing this line, `i` becomes a key in `d` with the value 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code. `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value, with `i` being the first integer in the list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.**
