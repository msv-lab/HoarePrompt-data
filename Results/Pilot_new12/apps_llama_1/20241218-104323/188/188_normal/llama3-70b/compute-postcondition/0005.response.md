The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one integer element which is the input integer `n`. 

The new element appended to `a` is an integer input. The value of `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100, and `i` is still 1.

The list `a` now contains two elements: the first element is `n` (an even integer between 2 and 100), and the second element is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is `n` and the second element is an input integer, `i` is 1**
