The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `a1`. The value of `i` is the second key in the dictionary `d`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `a1` is equal to `i`, which is the second key in `d`. 

	Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 2 keys, `i` is the second key in `d`, `a1` is equal to `i` which is the second key in `d`**
