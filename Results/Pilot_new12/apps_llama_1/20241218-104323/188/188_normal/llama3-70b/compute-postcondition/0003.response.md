The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input to the list `a`. The initial state of `a` is an empty list, so after this operation, `a` will contain one element, which is the input integer. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing one integer element which is the input integer, `i` is 0**
