Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 2 keys, `i` is the second key in `d`. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is equal to `i`, and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a2` is equal to the second key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
