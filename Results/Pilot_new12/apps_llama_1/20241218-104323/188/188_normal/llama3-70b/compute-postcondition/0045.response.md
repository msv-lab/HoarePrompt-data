The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. The value of `i` is the third key in dictionary `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 3 keys, `i` is the third key in `d`, `a1` is equal to `i`, which is the third key in `d`.**
