The function `func` does not seem to have any parameters defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function should operate on a sequence of n integers.


The function accepts a sequence of n integers as input, where n is between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is even. Each integer in the sequence is between 1 and 100.


Since the output cases are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given input constraints.


Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence of n integers where n is even and between 2 and 100, and each integer is between 1 and 100, but the exact return value is not specified.**
