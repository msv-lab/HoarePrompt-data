Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value and must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` of list `a` as one of its keys, and given that `d` was initially empty, the current value of `d` is a dictionary where `i` is a key, and `a` and `n` retain their initial properties.**
