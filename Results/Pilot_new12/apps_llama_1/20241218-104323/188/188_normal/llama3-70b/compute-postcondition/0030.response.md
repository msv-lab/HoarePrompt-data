The value of `a1` is updated to be equal to the first key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 1 key, `i` is the first key in `d`, the count of the first key `i` in the dictionary `d` equals half of the value of `n`, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 1 key, `i` is the first key in `d`, the count of the first key `i` in the dictionary `d` equals half of the value of `n`, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and `c` is 0**
