The code introduces two new variables, `a1` and `a2`, and assigns them the value `-1`. The existing variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `i`, and `c` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, and `a2` is -1**
