Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`. If at least two integers' counts in `d` equal `n // 2`, then `c` is 1, `a1` and `a2` are the first and second such integers respectively, and 'YES' has been printed to the output along with `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 if exactly one integer's count equals `n // 2`, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1, and 'NO' has been printed and returned.**
