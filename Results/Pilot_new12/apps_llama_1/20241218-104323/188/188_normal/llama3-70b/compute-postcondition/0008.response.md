To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is designed to iterate `n` times, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive. In each iteration, it appends an integer input to the list `a`.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, as it does not change within the loop.
- `a` starts as an empty list and accumulates integer elements in each iteration, where each element is an input integer.
- `i` increments by 1 in each iteration, starting from 0.

Considering the loop will execute `n` times, we can infer the final state as follows:
- `n` will still be an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, as its value does not change.
- `a` will be a list containing `n` integer elements, where each element is an input integer. The first element is the first input integer, the second element is the second input integer, and so on, until the `n`th element, which is the `n`th input integer.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes, because it starts at 0 and increments `n` times.

Given this analysis, if the loop executes `n` times, the output state will reflect the accumulation of input integers into the list `a` and the final value of `i`.

However, we must also consider the case where the loop does not execute at all, which would happen if `n` were 0. But since `n` is specified as an even integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, this scenario is outside the given initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value, `i` is `n-1`.**
