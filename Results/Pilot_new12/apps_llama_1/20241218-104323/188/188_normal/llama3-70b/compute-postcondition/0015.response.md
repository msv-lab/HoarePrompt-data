Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where if `i` was initially a key in `d`, then `i` is a key with a value of 2, otherwise `i` is a key with a value of 1, and `a` and `n` retain their initial properties.**
