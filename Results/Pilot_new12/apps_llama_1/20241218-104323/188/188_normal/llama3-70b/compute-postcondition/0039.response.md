The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `d` is still a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 2 keys, `i` is still the second key in `d`, and `a1` is still equal to `i` which is the second key in `d`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 2 keys, `i` is the second key in `d`, `a1` is equal to `i` which is the second key in `d`, and `c` is increased by 1**
