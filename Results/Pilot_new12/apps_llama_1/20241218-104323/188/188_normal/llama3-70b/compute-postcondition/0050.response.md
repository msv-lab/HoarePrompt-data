Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 3 keys, `i` is the third key in `d`. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then if `c` is 0, `a1` is equal to `i` and `c` is incremented by 1, otherwise `a2` is equal to the third key in `d` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[i]` does not equal `n // 2`, no changes are made.***
