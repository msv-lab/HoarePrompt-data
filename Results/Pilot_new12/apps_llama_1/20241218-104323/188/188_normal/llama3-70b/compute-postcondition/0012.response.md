The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, `d` is a dictionary where `i` is a key, and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The initial value of `d[i]` is 1 since `d` was initially empty and became a dictionary where `i` is a key. After incrementing `d[i]` by 1, the value of `d[i]` becomes 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` remains a list of `n` integers, `i` remains the first integer in the list `a`, and `d` remains a dictionary that contains `i` as one of its keys.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value of 2, and `a` and `n` retain their initial properties.**
