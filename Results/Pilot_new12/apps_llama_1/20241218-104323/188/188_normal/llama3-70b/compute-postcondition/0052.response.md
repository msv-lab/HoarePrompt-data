Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`, `c` is 1 because at least one integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2`, the current value of `a1` is the first integer whose count equals `n // 2`, and the current value of `a2` is the second integer whose count equals `n // 2`, indicating that there are at least two integers in `a` with counts equal to `n // 2`.**
