Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 otherwise, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1 if fewer than two integers' counts equal `n // 2` and the second such integer otherwise. Either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1 (or both), meaning that there are either no integers or only one integer in `a` whose count equals `n // 2`.**
