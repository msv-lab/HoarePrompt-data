Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer and must have at least 3 keys, `i` is the third key in `d`. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is equal to `i`, which is the third key in `d`, and `c` is the initial value of `c` plus 1. Otherwise, `a2` is equal to the third key in `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
