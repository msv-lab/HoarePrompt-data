Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks if there are two distinct integers that appear exactly n/2 times in the input sequence. It first counts the occurrences of each integer and then checks if there are at least two integers that appear exactly n/2 times. If such a pair of integers exists, it prints 'YES' and the pair of integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The code handles all the potential cases correctly. For example, if there are two integers that appear exactly n/2 times, it will print 'YES' and the pair of integers. If there is no such pair, it will print 'NO'. 

The function also correctly handles edge cases. For example, if there is only one integer that appears n times (i.e., all the integers are the same), it will print 'NO', which is correct because the problem requires two distinct integers.

The code also agrees with the output hints provided. The functionality of the code is as described in the hints, and it correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the hints.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For example, for the input 
```
4
11
27
27
11
```
the code will print 
```
YES
11 27
```
which is correct. For the input 
```
2
6
6
```
the code will print 
```
NO
```
which is also correct.

In general, the code correctly solves the problem as described in the problem description, and it handles all the potential cases and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
