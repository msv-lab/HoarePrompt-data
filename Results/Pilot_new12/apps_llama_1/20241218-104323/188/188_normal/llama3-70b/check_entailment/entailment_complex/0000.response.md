Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly determines whether it's possible for Petya and Vasya to choose integers such that the game is fair, i.e., they can take all `n` cards with each player taking exactly `n/2` cards.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 100, and then reads `n` integers between 1 and 100.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It then counts the occurrences of each integer using a dictionary `d`, where the keys are the unique integers and the values are their respective counts.

3. **Checking for Fair Game**: The program iterates through the dictionary `d` to find integers that appear exactly `n/2` times. It keeps track of the first two such integers found, `a1` and `a2`.

4. **Printing Result**: If it finds at least two integers that appear exactly `n/2` times (`a1` and `a2` are both not -1), it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where no integer or only one integer appears `n/2` times, as it checks if both `a1` and `a2` are not -1 before printing 'YES' and the pair of integers.

Since we assume the input is valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program's behavior is correct according to the problem description. It will always print the correct result for any valid input, making it a correct solution to the problem.
