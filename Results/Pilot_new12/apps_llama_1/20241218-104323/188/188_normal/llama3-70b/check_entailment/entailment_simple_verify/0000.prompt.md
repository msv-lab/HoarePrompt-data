You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where there are more than two numbers with the count equal to `n // 2`. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 all appear twice, which is equal to `n // 2`. However, the program will only consider the first two numbers it finds (1 and 2), and will not consider the fact that the number 3 also appears twice. As a result, the program will incorrectly print "YES" and output the numbers 1 and 2, when in fact there is no way for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers such that the game is fair. 

In this case, the program should print "NO" because there is no pair of distinct numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. 

The program should be modified to check if there are exactly two numbers that appear `n // 2` times, and if so, print "YES" and output those numbers. If there are more or fewer than two such numbers, the program should print "NO". 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    count = sum(1 for i in d if d[i] == n // 2)
    if count == 2:
        a1, a2 = [i for i in d if d[i] == n // 2]
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a sequence of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n is even), where each integer is between 1 and 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value, `i` is `n-1`.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` is the last integer in `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `d` is an empty dictionary and `a` is an empty list, which contradicts the initial state that `n` is between 2 and 100. If we consider the case where `n` is indeed 0 and `a` is empty, then `d` is an empty dictionary.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 otherwise, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1 if fewer than two integers' counts equal `n // 2` and the second such integer otherwise.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`. If at least two integers' counts in `d` equal `n // 2`, then `c` is 1, `a1` and `a2` are the first and second such integers respectively, and 'YES' has been printed to the output along with `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 if exactly one integer's count equals `n // 2`, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1, and 'NO' has been printed and returned.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
