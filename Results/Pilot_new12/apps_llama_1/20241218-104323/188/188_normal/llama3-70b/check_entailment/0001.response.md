Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles every potential case. The program reads the input, counts the occurrences of each number, and checks if there are two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times. If it finds such numbers, it prints "YES" and the two numbers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of cards (n) and the numbers on each card.
2. It counts the occurrences of each number correctly: It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number.
3. It checks if there are two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times: It iterates over the dictionary and checks if a number appears exactly n/2 times. If it finds such a number, it stores it in a1. If it finds another number that appears exactly n/2 times, it stores it in a2.
4. It prints the correct output: If it finds two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, it prints "YES" and the two numbers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles every potential case, including:

* If there are no two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, it prints "NO".
* If there are two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, it prints "YES" and the two numbers.
* If there are more than two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, it still prints the correct output, because it only needs to find two such numbers.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
