You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input

11
27
27

Output
YES
11 27

Input

Output
NO

10
20

Output
NO

Input

2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a sequence of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n is even), where each integer is between 1 and 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is an input value, `i` is `n-1`.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `a` and the values are the counts of each integer, `i` is the last integer in `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `d` is an empty dictionary and `a` is an empty list, which contradicts the initial state that `n` is between 2 and 100. If we consider the case where `n` is indeed 0 and `a` is empty, then `d` is an empty dictionary.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 otherwise, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1 if fewer than two integers' counts equal `n // 2` and the second such integer otherwise.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers in `a` and values as their counts, `i` is the last key iterated in `d`. If at least two integers' counts in `d` equal `n // 2`, then `c` is 1, `a1` and `a2` are the first and second such integers respectively, and 'YES' has been printed to the output along with `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, `c` is 0 if no integer's count in `d` equals `n // 2` and 1 if exactly one integer's count equals `n // 2`, `a1` is -1 if no integer's count equals `n // 2` and the first such integer otherwise, `a2` is -1, and 'NO' has been printed and returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a sequence of n integers where n is even and between 2 and 100, and each integer is between 1 and 100. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are at least two integers that appear exactly n/2 times. If such a pair of integers exists, the function prints 'YES' and the pair of integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the output. The function handles edge cases where no integer or only one integer appears n/2 times, and it correctly identifies the first and second such integers if they exist. However, the function does not handle cases where n is not even or where the input integers are outside the range of 1 to 100, as it assumes the input is valid according to the initial state description. Additionally, the function does not provide any output or error message if the input is invalid, it simply executes with potentially incorrect results. The function's purpose is to identify pairs of integers that appear with equal frequency, covering half of the total input numbers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
