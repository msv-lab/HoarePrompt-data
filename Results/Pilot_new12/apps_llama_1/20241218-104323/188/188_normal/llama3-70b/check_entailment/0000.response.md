Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where there are more than two numbers with the count equal to `n // 2`. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 all appear twice, which is equal to `n // 2`. However, the program will only consider the first two numbers it finds (1 and 2), and will not consider the fact that the number 3 also appears twice. As a result, the program will incorrectly print "YES" and output the numbers 1 and 2, when in fact there is no way for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers such that the game is fair. 

In this case, the program should print "NO" because there is no pair of distinct numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. 

The program should be modified to check if there are exactly two numbers that appear `n // 2` times, and if so, print "YES" and output those numbers. If there are more or fewer than two such numbers, the program should print "NO". 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    count = sum(1 for i in d if d[i] == n // 2)
    if count == 2:
        a1, a2 = [i for i in d if d[i] == n // 2]
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')
```
