Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input handling**: The program correctly reads the input, which consists of a sequence of `n` integers (where `n` is even) and stores them in the list `a`.

2. **Counting occurrences**: The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This allows it to identify the unique integers and their respective counts.

3. **Finding pairs with equal counts**: The program then iterates over the dictionary `d` to find pairs of unique integers that have counts equal to `n // 2`. If such a pair is found, it stores the integers in `a1` and `a2`.

4. **Output**: If a pair of integers with equal counts is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the two integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If there are two unique integers with counts equal to `n // 2`, it prints "YES" along with the integers.
- If there is only one unique integer with a count equal to `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because Petya and Vasya must choose distinct integers.
- If there are no unique integers with counts equal to `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the game cannot be fair.

The program assumes that the input will be valid, as specified in the problem statement. It does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., `n` is not even, or the input integers are not between 1 and 100). However, since we assume that the input will always be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it does so in a way that is efficient and easy to understand.
