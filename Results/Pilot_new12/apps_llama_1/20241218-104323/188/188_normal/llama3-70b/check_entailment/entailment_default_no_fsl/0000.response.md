Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the input sequence and checks if there are at least two integers that appear exactly n/2 times. If such a pair of integers exists, the function prints 'YES' and the pair of integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The code correctly handles all the edge cases provided in the problem description. For example, when there is only one integer on all cards, the function correctly prints 'NO'. It also handles cases where there are multiple pairs of integers that appear exactly n/2 times, as it breaks the loop as soon as it finds the first pair.

The code assumes that the input is valid according to the problem description, i.e., n is an even number and each integer is between 1 and 100. Therefore, it does not include any error checking for invalid inputs.

The provided output hints agree with the code's functionality, and all the examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
