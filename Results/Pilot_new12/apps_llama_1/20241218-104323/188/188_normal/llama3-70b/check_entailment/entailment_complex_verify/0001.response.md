The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and it still holds after analyzing the annotated version of the code. The program accurately follows the problem description and handles potential cases as mentioned in the original assessment.

The annotated version of the code provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the program's execution, including the state of variables at different points. This annotation confirms that the program correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of each number, checks if there are two numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, and prints the correct output.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles edge cases where no integer or only one integer appears n/2 times. It also correctly identifies the first and second such integers if they exist.

One potential issue mentioned in the annotated version is that the function does not handle cases where n is not even or where the input integers are outside the range of 1 to 100. However, as stated in the problem description and the note, it is assumed that the input will be valid, and the program is designed under this assumption. Therefore, this does not affect the program's correctness.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the refined assessment maintains that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
