Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The program correctly implements the required functionality: it reads the input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and checks if there are at least two integers that appear exactly n/2 times. If such a pair of integers exists, the program prints 'YES' and the pair of integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The output hints confirm that the program handles edge cases where no integer or only one integer appears n/2 times and correctly identifies the first and second such integers if they exist. The hints also mention that the program does not handle cases where n is not even or where the input integers are outside the range of 1 to 100, but this is not a concern since the problem description guarantees that n is even and the input integers are within the specified range.

The program's purpose is to identify pairs of integers that appear with equal frequency, covering half of the total input numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints do not reveal any flaws in the program's logic or implementation, and the code appears to be correct based on the provided information.

Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate, and I maintain this assessment.

Final: **True**
