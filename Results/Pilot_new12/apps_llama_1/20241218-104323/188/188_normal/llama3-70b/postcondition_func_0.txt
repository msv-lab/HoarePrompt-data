Functionality: The function accepts a sequence of n integers where n is even and between 2 and 100, and each integer is between 1 and 100. It counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are at least two integers that appear exactly n/2 times. If such a pair of integers exists, the function prints 'YES' and the pair of integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the output. The function handles edge cases where no integer or only one integer appears n/2 times, and it correctly identifies the first and second such integers if they exist. However, the function does not handle cases where n is not even or where the input integers are outside the range of 1 to 100, as it assumes the input is valid according to the initial state description. Additionally, the function does not provide any output or error message if the input is invalid, it simply executes with potentially incorrect results. The function's purpose is to identify pairs of integers that appear with equal frequency, covering half of the total input numbers.
