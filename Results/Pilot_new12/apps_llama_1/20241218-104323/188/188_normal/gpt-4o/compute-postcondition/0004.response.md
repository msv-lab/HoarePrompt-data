Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies. The current value of `unique_numbers` has less than 2 elements, meaning that `cards` contains either a single unique integer or no integers at all, resulting in `count` having at most one key and `unique_numbers` having at most one element.**
