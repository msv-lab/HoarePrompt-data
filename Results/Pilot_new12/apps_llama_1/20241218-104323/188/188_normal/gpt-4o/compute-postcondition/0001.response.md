The provided code snippet reads `n` lines of input from the console, where each line contains an integer. These integers are stored in a list called `cards`.

Given that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the code will read `n` integers from the input and store them in the `cards` list.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console**.
