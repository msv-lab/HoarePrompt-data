Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies, the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, and the current values of `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` are both equal to `n // 2`, meaning that the two most frequent numbers in `cards` each appear exactly half of the time**
