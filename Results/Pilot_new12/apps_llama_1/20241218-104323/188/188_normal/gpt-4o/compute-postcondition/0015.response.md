Functionality: **The function reads a sequence of integers from the console, starting with the count of integers, and then processes these integers to determine if they can be divided into two equal groups, each containing the same number. It returns 'YES' along with the two unique numbers that make up these groups if it's possible, and 'NO' otherwise. The function requires the following conditions to be met to return 'YES': the number of integers is even, there are at least two unique integers, and the two most frequent integers appear exactly half the time. The function handles edge cases such as when there are less than two unique integers or when the two most frequent integers do not appear exactly half the time, in which case it returns 'NO'. After the function executes, the console will have printed either 'YES' along with the two unique numbers that make up the groups, or 'NO'.**
