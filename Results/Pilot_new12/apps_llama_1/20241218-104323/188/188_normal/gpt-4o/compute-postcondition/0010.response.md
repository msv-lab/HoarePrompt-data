Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies, the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, and it is not the case that the frequency of the last element in `unique_numbers` equals `n // 2` and the frequency of the second last element in `unique_numbers` equals `n // 2`.**
