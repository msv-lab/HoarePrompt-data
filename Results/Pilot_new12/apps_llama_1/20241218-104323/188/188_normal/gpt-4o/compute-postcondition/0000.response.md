The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the console and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, the first line of the input contains a single integer `n`, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), read from the console as input, and the following n lines of input containing a sequence of integers are pending to be read**.
