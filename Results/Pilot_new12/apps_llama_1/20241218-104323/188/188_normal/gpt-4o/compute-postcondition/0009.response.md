The provided Python code snippet prints the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` to the console. The values of the variables do not change, but these two values are printed. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is still a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is still a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, and `unique_numbers` is still a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies, the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2`, `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` have been printed to the console**
