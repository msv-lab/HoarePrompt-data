Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their frequencies, and the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more. If `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` equals `n // 2` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` equals `n // 2`, then 'YES' has been printed to the console along with `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
