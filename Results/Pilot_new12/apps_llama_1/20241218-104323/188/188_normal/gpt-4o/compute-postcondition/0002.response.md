To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console.

The code is: `count = Counter(cards)`. This line of code uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module in Python to count the frequency of each integer in the `cards` list.

Given that `cards` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the `Counter(cards)` expression will create a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique integers from the `cards` list and the values are their respective frequencies.

Therefore, after executing the code, `count` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the number of times that integer appears in `cards`. The state of `n` and `cards` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` integers read from the console, `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `cards` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `cards`.**
