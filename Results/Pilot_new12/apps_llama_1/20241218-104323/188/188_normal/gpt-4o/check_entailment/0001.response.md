Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. In the given code, the logic checks if the most frequent and the second most frequent numbers appear exactly half of the time, which is correct. However, the problem statement does not restrict the solution to only the two most frequent numbers. 

For example, consider an input where `n = 6`, and the numbers on the cards are `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. In this case, the program will print `NO` because the most frequent and the second most frequent numbers (`1` and `2`) do not appear exactly half of the time. However, the game can be fair if Petya chooses `1` and Vasya chooses `2` or `3`, or if Petya chooses `2` and Vasya chooses `1` or `3`, and so on.

The program should check all pairs of unique numbers to see if their counts sum up to `n` and if each of them appears exactly `n/2` times. The given code does not consider all possible pairs, which is why it's incorrect.

Here's a possible corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys())
    
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        found_solution = False
        for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
                if count[unique_numbers[i]] + count[unique_numbers[j]] == n and count[unique_numbers[i]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[j]] == n // 2:
                    print('YES')
                    print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                    found_solution = True
                    break
            if found_solution:
                break
        if not found_solution:
            print('NO')

func()
```
