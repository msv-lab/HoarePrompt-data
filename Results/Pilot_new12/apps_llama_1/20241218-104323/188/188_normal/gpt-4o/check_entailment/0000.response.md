Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
1
1
```

In this case, the program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because Petya can choose the number 1 and Vasya can choose the number 2, resulting in each player taking 4 cards is not possible but Petya can take 4 cards (1) and Vasya can take 2 cards (2), which is not fair. However Petya can choose the number 1 (4 cards) and Vasya can choose another number that occurs twice (2 cards), to make the game fair. The program should check all possible pairs of numbers and their counts, not just the two most frequent numbers.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if the two most frequent numbers have counts equal to n/2, but it does not check if there are other pairs of numbers that can result in a fair game. 

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" is not possible because there is no pair of numbers that occurs 3 times. However the program should print "NO" because there is no pair of numbers where each occurs 3 times, which is required for a fair game with 6 cards.

However there is an example that the program fails, consider the input:

```
4
1
1
3
3
```

In this case, the program will print "YES" and the numbers 1 and 3, which is correct. However the issue with the code is that if we have 4 cards and 4 different numbers, the code will print "NO" which is correct. But if we have a number that occurs twice and another number that also occurs twice, the code will print "YES" and the 2 numbers. But if we have 4 cards and 2 pairs of numbers where each number occurs twice, the code should print "YES" and any 2 numbers that occur twice.

However the code also fails in cases where there are 2 distinct numbers that each occur n/2 times, but there are also other numbers that occur. 

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
1
1
2
2
2
2
```
However this is not a case because the input has 8 numbers and not 6.

But if we have 6 cards and a number occurs 4 times, and there are 2 other distinct numbers that occur once. In this case the program should print "NO", which the program does. However, if we have 6 cards, and 2 distinct numbers that each occur 3 times, the program will not print the correct answer because the program only checks if the 2 most frequent numbers have counts equal to n/2.

However there are cases where the program works correctly. For example:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

And also:

```
2
1
1
```

And:

```
6
1
1
1
1
2
2
```
However as mentioned earlier, the issue with the program is that it does not check all possible pairs of numbers and their counts. The program should print "YES" if there are two distinct numbers that each occur n/2 times, and print "NO" otherwise. 

Also it does not consider the case where there are two distinct numbers that each occur more than n/2 times, and another number that occurs less than n/2 times. 

In summary, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
