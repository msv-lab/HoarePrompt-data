You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

11
27

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
1
1
```

In this case, the program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because Petya can choose the number 1 and Vasya can choose the number 2, resulting in each player taking 4 cards is not possible but Petya can take 4 cards (1) and Vasya can take 2 cards (2), which is not fair. However Petya can choose the number 1 (4 cards) and Vasya can choose another number that occurs twice (2 cards), to make the game fair. The program should check all possible pairs of numbers and their counts, not just the two most frequent numbers.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if the two most frequent numbers have counts equal to n/2, but it does not check if there are other pairs of numbers that can result in a fair game. 

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" is not possible because there is no pair of numbers that occurs 3 times. However the program should print "NO" because there is no pair of numbers where each occurs 3 times, which is required for a fair game with 6 cards.

However there is an example that the program fails, consider the input:

```
4
1
1
3
3
```

In this case, the program will print "YES" and the numbers 1 and 3, which is correct. However the issue with the code is that if we have 4 cards and 4 different numbers, the code will print "NO" which is correct. But if we have a number that occurs twice and another number that also occurs twice, the code will print "YES" and the 2 numbers. But if we have 4 cards and 2 pairs of numbers where each number occurs twice, the code should print "YES" and any 2 numbers that occur twice.

However the code also fails in cases where there are 2 distinct numbers that each occur n/2 times, but there are also other numbers that occur. 

For example, consider the input:

```
6
1
1
1
1
2
2
2
2
```
However this is not a case because the input has 8 numbers and not 6.

But if we have 6 cards and a number occurs 4 times, and there are 2 other distinct numbers that occur once. In this case the program should print "NO", which the program does. However, if we have 6 cards, and 2 distinct numbers that each occur 3 times, the program will not print the correct answer because the program only checks if the 2 most frequent numbers have counts equal to n/2.

However there are cases where the program works correctly. For example:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

And also:

```
2
1
1
```

And:

```
6
1
1
1
1
2
2
```
However as mentioned earlier, the issue with the program is that it does not check all possible pairs of numbers and their counts. The program should print "YES" if there are two distinct numbers that each occur n/2 times, and print "NO" otherwise. 

Also it does not consider the case where there are two distinct numbers that each occur more than n/2 times, and another number that occurs less than n/2 times. 

In summary, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a sequence of integers from the console, starting with the count of integers, and then processes these integers to determine if they can be divided into two equal groups, each containing the same number. It returns 'YES' along with the two unique numbers that make up these groups if it's possible, and 'NO' otherwise. The function requires the following conditions to be met to return 'YES': the number of integers is even, there are at least two unique integers, and the two most frequent integers appear exactly half the time. The function handles edge cases such as when there are less than two unique integers or when the two most frequent integers do not appear exactly half the time, in which case it returns 'NO'. After the function executes, the console will have printed either 'YES' along with the two unique numbers that make up the groups, or 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
