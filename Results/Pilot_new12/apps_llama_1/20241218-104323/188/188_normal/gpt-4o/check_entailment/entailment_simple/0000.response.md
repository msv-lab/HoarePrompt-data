Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input from the console, including the number of cards `n` and the sequence of integers on each card.
2. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each integer on the cards.
3. It sorts the unique integers by their frequencies and stores them in the `unique_numbers` list.
4. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, it prints "NO" because there are not enough distinct integers to distribute the cards fairly.
5. If the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more, it checks if the two most frequent integers (`unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`) have frequencies equal to `n // 2`. If they do, it prints "YES" along with these two integers, because Petya and Vasya can choose these integers to distribute the cards fairly.
6. If the lengths of the two most frequent integers are not equal to `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because there is no way to distribute the cards fairly.

The program handles all potential cases specified in the problem description:

* If there are not enough distinct integers, it prints "NO".
* If there are enough distinct integers, but the two most frequent ones do not have frequencies equal to `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
* If there are enough distinct integers and the two most frequent ones have frequencies equal to `n // 2`, it prints "YES" along with these two integers.

The program assumes that the input is valid, which is specified in the problem description. It does not handle cases where the input is invalid, but this is not required according to the problem description.
