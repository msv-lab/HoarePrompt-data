Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input from the console as specified, with the first line containing an even integer `n` and the following `n` lines containing integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer on the cards, which is an efficient way to solve the problem.

3. The program checks if there are at least two unique integers on the cards. If not, it prints 'NO' as required by the problem description, because the game cannot be fair if there is only one unique number.

4. If there are at least two unique integers, the program checks if the two most frequent integers appear exactly `n // 2` times each. If they do, it prints 'YES' along with these two integers, as required by the problem description. This is a valid solution because it ensures that the game is fair, with each player getting exactly `n // 2` cards.

5. If the two most frequent integers do not appear exactly `n // 2` times each, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because the problem description requires that the game be fair, with each player getting exactly `n // 2` cards. If the two most frequent integers do not meet this condition, then there is no way to divide the cards fairly between the two players.

The program handles all possible cases as required by the problem description and always produces the correct output for valid input. Therefore, its correctness is **True**.
