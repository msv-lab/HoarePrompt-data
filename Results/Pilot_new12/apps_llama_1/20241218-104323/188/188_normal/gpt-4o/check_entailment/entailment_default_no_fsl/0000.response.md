Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the condition where it checks if the two most frequent integers appear exactly half the time. This condition is not sufficient to guarantee a fair game.

A counterexample is when there are more than two unique integers, and two of them have the same frequency, which is exactly half the total number of cards. In this case, the code will not return the correct result because it only checks the two most frequent integers.

For example, if the input is:
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

The code will return 'NO', but it should return 'YES' with the numbers 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, or 2 and 3, because these pairs of numbers can divide the cards into two equal groups.

The code should be modified to check all pairs of unique integers, not just the two most frequent ones. This can be achieved by iterating over all pairs of unique integers and checking if their combined frequency is equal to the total number of cards and if each integer appears exactly half the time. If such a pair is found, the code should return 'YES' along with the pair of numbers. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the code should return 'NO'. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
from collections import Counter
import itertools

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys())
    for pair in itertools.combinations(unique_numbers, 2):
        if count[pair[0]] + count[pair[1]] == n and count[pair[0]] == n // 2 and count[pair[1]] == n // 2:
            print('YES')
            print(pair[0], pair[1])
            return
    print('NO')
```
