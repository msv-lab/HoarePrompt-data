The function takes no explicit input arguments, but it reads the input from the console, where the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the following n lines contain a sequence of integers (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards, where n is an even number.
