Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. The function processes the input by converting it to a string, calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and comparing this sum to the original number. The provided test cases cover valid scenarios and edge cases like single-digit numbers, and the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
