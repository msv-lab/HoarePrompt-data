Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to the original number. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles all possible non-negative integers, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (0 through 9). The function behaves as expected based on the problem description and the test cases, making the original assessment correct.
