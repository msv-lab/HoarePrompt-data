Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for every potential case. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1` converts the number to a string to easily access each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including single-digit numbers and large numbers. The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the function for the given examples. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
