Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotations confirm that the function converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then compares this sum to the original number. The provided test cases cover basic scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Since the annotated version aligns with the function's logic and the test cases pass, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
