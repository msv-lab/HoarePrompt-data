Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a single non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. **Conversion to String**: The number `n` is converted to a string (`num_str`) to easily access individual digits.
3. **Length Calculation**: The length of the string representation of `n` (`num_len`) is calculated.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` is computed using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function.
5. **Comparison and Return**: The function returns `True` if the computed sum equals the original number `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1(153) == True`: 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `assert func_1(259) == False`: 259 is not an Armstrong number because no combination of its digits raised to the power of 3 sums up to 259.
- `assert func_1(4458) == False`: 4458 is not an Armstrong number because no combination of its digits raised to the power of 4 sums up to 4458.

Since the program correctly checks whether a number is an Armstrong number according to the given problem description, the correctness is **True**.
