You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then compares this sum to the original number. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1(153) == True` (153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\))
- `assert func_1(259) == False` (259 is not an Armstrong number)
- `assert func_1(4458) == False` (4458 is not an Armstrong number)

These test cases cover basic scenarios, but the function's logic is sound and should handle any positive integer correctly. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description and the provided tests pass, we can conclude that the function works as intended for all potential cases within the scope of Armstrong numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it to a string `num_str`. It then calculates the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of the length of `num_str`. If this sum equals `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This process covers all possible non-negative integers, including zero and single-digit numbers. An edge case to note is that for single-digit numbers (0 through 9), the sum of the digit raised to its own power equals the number itself, which is handled correctly by the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
