Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then compares this sum to the original number. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1(153) == True` (153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\))
- `assert func_1(259) == False` (259 is not an Armstrong number)
- `assert func_1(4458) == False` (4458 is not an Armstrong number)

These test cases cover basic scenarios, but the function's logic is sound and should handle any positive integer correctly. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description and the provided tests pass, we can conclude that the function works as intended for all potential cases within the scope of Armstrong numbers.
