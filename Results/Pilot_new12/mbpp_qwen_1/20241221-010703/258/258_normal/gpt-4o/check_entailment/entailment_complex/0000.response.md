Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number or not. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number.
2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`.
   - It converts the integer to a string to facilitate digit extraction.
   - It calculates the sum of each digit in the number raised to the power of the number of digits (`num_len`).
   - It returns `True` if this calculated sum is equal to the original number `n`, otherwise `False`.

3. **Edge Cases Handled**:
   - For single-digit numbers (0 through 9), the sum of the digit raised to its own power equals the number itself, which is handled correctly.
   - The function correctly handles larger numbers by ensuring the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.

Given these points, the function `func_1` accurately performs the required task as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
