The code calculates the Armstrong sum of the digits of `num_str`. The Armstrong sum is calculated by raising each digit of `num_str` to the power of its length (which is stored in `num_len`) and then summing these values. 

- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.

Let's denote the length of `num_str` as `len(num_str)` and the digits in `num_str` as `digit`.

The Armstrong sum is computed as follows:

```python
armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** len(num_str) for digit in num_str)
```

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation. For instance, if `n` is 153, then `num_str` would be "153" and `num_len` would be 3. The code would compute:

```python
armstrong_sum = 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3
```

Which evaluates to:

```python
armstrong_sum = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
```

Given this general form and example, the output state will include the updated value of `armstrong_sum` based on the digits and their count in `num_str`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
