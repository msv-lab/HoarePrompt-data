`num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. The length of `num_str` is equal to the number of characters in the string representation of `n`. Therefore, `num_len` will be an integer representing this count. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`**
