The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it to a string `num_str`. It then calculates the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of the length of `num_str`. If this sum equals `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This process covers all possible non-negative integers, including zero and single-digit numbers. An edge case to note is that for single-digit numbers (0 through 9), the sum of the digit raised to its own power equals the number itself, which is handled correctly by the function.
