Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `num`. For each iteration, it converts the current digit to an integer and raises it to the power of `num_len`, then adds this value to `sum`.

### Initial State
- `num` is an integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
- `sum` is 0.

### Loop Execution
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.
   - `sum` becomes `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.
   - After the first iteration, `sum` is updated to `0 + int(digit) ** num_len`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `digit` is the second character in `num_str`.
   - `sum` becomes `sum + int(digit) ** (num_len - 1)`.
   - After the second iteration, `sum` is updated to `0 + int(d1) ** num_len + int(d2) ** (num_len - 1)`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `digit` is the third character in `num_str`.
   - `sum` becomes `sum + int(digit) ** (num_len - 2)`.
   - After the third iteration, `sum` is updated to `0 + int(d1) ** num_len + int(d2) ** (num_len - 1) + int(d3) ** (num_len - 2)`.

### General Iteration Pattern
After `k` iterations, where `k` is the number of digits in `num_str`, `sum` will be:
\[ \text{sum} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \text{int}(d_i)^{(num\_len - i)} \]

### Final State After All Iterations
- `num` remains unchanged as it is an integer.
- `num_str` remains the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` when the loop terminates.
- `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left.

### Case When the Loop Does Not Execute
If `num_str` is empty (which means `num` is 0), the loop will not execute. Therefore:
- `num` is 0.
- `num_str` is an empty string.
- `num_len` is 0.
- `sum` remains 0.

### Output State
Combining these observations, we get the following output state:

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left.**
