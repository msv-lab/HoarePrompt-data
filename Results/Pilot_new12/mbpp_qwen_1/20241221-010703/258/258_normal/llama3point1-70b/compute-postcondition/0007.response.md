According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `num_str`. Whether the loop can execute again depends on the remaining characters in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` and must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, and `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits read so far.

To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

1. **Current State**: The loop has just processed one digit from `num_str`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more character left in `num_str`.

Therefore, `num_str` must have at least two characters (one already processed plus one more).

- `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `num_str` must now have at least two characters.
- `num_len` will be the length of `num_str` minus 1.
- `sum` will include the value of the current digit processed.

Since the loop has just processed one digit, `num_str` will have one less character, making `num_len` one less than before.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `num_str` must have at least two characters.
- `num_len` will be the length of the updated `num_str` minus 1.
- `sum` will remain the same as the previous value.

**State:**
- `num` is an integer
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least two characters
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1
- `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits read so far

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least two characters, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits read so far**
