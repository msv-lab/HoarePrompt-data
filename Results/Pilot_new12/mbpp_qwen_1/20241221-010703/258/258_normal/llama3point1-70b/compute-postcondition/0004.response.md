The code updates the `sum` by adding the value of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `num`, the updated value of `sum` will depend on the digits of `num`.

Let's denote the digits of `num` as `d1, d2, ..., dk` where `k` is the length of `num_str` (which is `num_len`). The updated `sum` will be:

\[ \text{sum} = \text{sum} + d1^{\text{num_len}} + d2^{\text{num_len}} + \ldots + dk^{\text{num_len}} \]

Given the initial state:
- `num` is an integer
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`
- `sum` is 0

After executing the code, the value of `sum` will be the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0 + \(d1^{\text{num_len}} + d2^{\text{num_len}} + \ldots + dk^{\text{num_len}}\)**
