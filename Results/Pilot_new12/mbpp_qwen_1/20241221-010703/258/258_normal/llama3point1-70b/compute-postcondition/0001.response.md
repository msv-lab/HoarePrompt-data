The code `num_len = len(num_str)` calculates the length of the string representation of `num` and assigns it to `num_len`. The initial state includes that `num` is an integer and `num_str` is the string representation of `num`. After executing the code, `num_len` will store the length of `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`**
