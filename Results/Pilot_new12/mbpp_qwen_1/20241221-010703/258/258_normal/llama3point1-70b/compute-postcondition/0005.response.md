Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `num` (`num_str`). 

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is the string representation of `num` and must have at least one character.
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
   - `sum` is initialized as 0 and is updated based on the digits in `num_str`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop processes one digit from `num_str`.
   - The loop condition for the `for` loop is that there are still digits left to process in `num_str`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop iterates through each character in `num_str`, the variable `num_str` itself should be adjusted to remove the first processed digit.
   - `num_len` should be decremented by 1 because we are processing one character from `num_str`.
   - `sum` is updated during each iteration but its exact value depends on the current digit being processed.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `num_str` should have the remaining characters after removing the first character.
   - `num_len` should be reduced by 1.
   - `sum` is updated during the loop but its exact new value isn't specified without the loop body. We only know it includes the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments:

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is updated based on the previous iteration**.

To explicitly state the changes:

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is 0 + \(d1^{\text{num_len}} + d2^{\text{num_len}} + \ldots + dk^{\text{num_len}}\) where \(k = \text{num_len}\)**.
