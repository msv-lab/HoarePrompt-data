The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`. The initial state includes that `num` is an integer, `num_str` is its string representation (which must have at least one character), `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, and `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Given the code snippet:

```python
sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```

Let's analyze the impact:

1. `digit` is a part of `num_str`. Since `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `digit` can be any single character from this string.
2. `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, which means it is the number of digits in `num` minus 1.
3. The code adds the integer value of the current `digit` (converted from string to integer) raised to the power of `num_len` to `sum`.

Since the exact `digit` is not specified, let's denote it as `d` for simplicity. The new value of `sum` would be the original `sum` plus `int(d) ** num_len`.

Therefore, the updated `sum` is `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`**.
