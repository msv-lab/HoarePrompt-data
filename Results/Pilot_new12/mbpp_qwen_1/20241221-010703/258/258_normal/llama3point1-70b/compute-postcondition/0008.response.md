The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` takes the `digit` (which is a character representing a digit from the string `num_str`) converts it to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds this value to `sum`. 

- The initial state includes:
  - `num` is an integer
  - `num_str` is the string representation of `num` and has at least two characters
  - `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1
  - `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits read so far

After executing the code, `sum` will be updated to include the new term added by the equation. Since the exact value of `digit` is not specified, we will use a generic representation.

Let's denote the digit as `d` (a character), which when converted to an integer is `int(d)`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be the original `sum` plus `int(d) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least two characters, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the original sum plus `int(d) ** num_len`**
