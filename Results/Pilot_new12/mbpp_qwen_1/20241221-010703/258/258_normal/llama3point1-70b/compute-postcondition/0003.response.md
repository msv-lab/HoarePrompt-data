According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_str`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in `num_str`. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must contain at least one character.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
   - `sum` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `num_str`.

3. **Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_str` must have at least one character (since the loop iterates over each character in `num_str`).

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `num_str` contains at least one character.

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**
