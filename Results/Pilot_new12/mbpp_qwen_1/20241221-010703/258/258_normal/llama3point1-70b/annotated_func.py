#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left is equal to `num`, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and checks if the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, equals `num`. If the condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since \(0^0\) is often considered 1, and the sum would be 0.
2. If `num` is negative, the function should handle this case appropriately, although the current implementation only works with positive integers.

The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `num` is 0 or negative. Therefore, these edge cases should be included in the functionality description.
