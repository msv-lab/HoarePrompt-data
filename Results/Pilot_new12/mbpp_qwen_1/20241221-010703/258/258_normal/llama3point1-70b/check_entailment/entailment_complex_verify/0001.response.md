Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number for the specific case where the number of digits is equal to the power to which each digit is raised, it fails to handle edge cases mentioned in the annotated version. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where `num` is 0, which should return `True` because \(0^0\) is often considered 1, making the sum 0. Additionally, the function does not handle negative numbers, although the problem description did not explicitly mention handling negative numbers, the absence of this check can lead to incorrect results for negative inputs. Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the need to cover all specified edge cases, the original assessment cannot be maintained.
