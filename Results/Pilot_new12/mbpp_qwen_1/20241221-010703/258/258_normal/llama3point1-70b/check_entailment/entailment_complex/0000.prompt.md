You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is an integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of its position index from right to left is equal to `num`, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and checks if the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, equals `num`. If the condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since \(0^0\) is often considered 1, and the sum would be 0.
2. If `num` is negative, the function should handle this case appropriately, although the current implementation only works with positive integers.

The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `num` is 0 or negative. Therefore, these edge cases should be included in the functionality description.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
