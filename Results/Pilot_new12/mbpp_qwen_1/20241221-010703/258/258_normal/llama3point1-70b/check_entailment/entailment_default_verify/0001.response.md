Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. However, the provided code and the output hints indicate that the function does not handle edge cases properly. Specifically, the function does not account for the case where `num` is 0, which is a valid Armstrong number. Additionally, while the function works for positive integers, it does not handle negative integers, which is also an important consideration for completeness. Since the problem description asks for a function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number, the function should be robust enough to handle all valid inputs, including edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to be revised to include these edge case handling mechanisms.
