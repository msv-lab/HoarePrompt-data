You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a 3-digit number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
1. Converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Calculates the length of the string (which is the number of digits).
3. Sums each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

Since the function is designed to handle numbers with a specific property (Armstrong numbers), and it correctly implements the logic for such numbers, it meets the requirements for any valid Armstrong number. There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that would cause this function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and checks if the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, equals `num`. If the condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since \(0^0\) is often considered 1, and the sum would be 0.
2. If `num` is negative, the function should handle this case appropriately, although the current implementation only works with positive integers.

The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit in the string representation of `num`, raised to the power of its position index from right to left, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `num` is 0 or negative. Therefore, these edge cases should be included in the functionality description.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
