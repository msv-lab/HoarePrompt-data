Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when the input number is 0. According to the problem description, for \(0^0\), the sum should be 0, and the function should return `True`. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Additionally, while the code does not explicitly handle negative numbers, the problem description indicates that the function should work for negative inputs as well, though the current implementation only works with positive integers. Since the code fails to handle the edge case of 0, the overall correctness is False.
