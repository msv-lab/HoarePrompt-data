Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a 3-digit number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
1. Converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Calculates the length of the string (which is the number of digits).
3. Sums each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

Since the function is designed to handle numbers with a specific property (Armstrong numbers), and it correctly implements the logic for such numbers, it meets the requirements for any valid Armstrong number. There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that would cause this function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct.
