Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the edge cases specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. The program does not handle the case where `num` is 0. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` if `num` is 0 because \(0^0\) is often considered 1, and the sum would be 0. However, the current implementation does not account for this special case.

2. The program does not handle the case where `num` is negative. While the current implementation only works with positive integers, the problem description states that these edge cases should be included in the functionality description. Although the program technically does not fail when given a negative number (it just does not return `True`), it does not meet the full requirements of the problem description as stated.

To make the program correct, the function should include conditional checks for these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num == 0:
        return True  # Handle the special case where num is 0
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    
    return sum == num
```

With these changes, the function will correctly identify Armstrong numbers and handle the specified edge cases, making the program fully compliant with the problem description.
