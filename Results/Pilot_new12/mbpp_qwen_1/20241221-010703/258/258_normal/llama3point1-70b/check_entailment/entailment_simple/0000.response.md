Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` as input, which aligns with the problem description.
2. It converts the integer to a string (`num_str`) to iterate over each digit.
3. It calculates the length of the string representation of the number (`num_len`), which represents the number of digits in the original number.
4. A loop iterates over each digit in the string representation, converting it back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. These values are summed up.
5. Finally, it compares this sum with the original number `num`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly follows the logic required to determine if a number is an Armstrong number, as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
