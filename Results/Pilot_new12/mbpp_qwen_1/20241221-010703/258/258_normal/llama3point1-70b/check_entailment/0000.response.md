Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Armstrong number check. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. However, the program incorrectly calculates this by raising each digit to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, rather than the number of digits in the original number.

For example, consider the number 153, which is an Armstrong number:
- The correct calculation would be \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).
- The program's calculation is \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) (which is correct), but it mistakenly treats the length of the string (3) as the number of digits, leading to the same result in this specific case but potentially failing for other numbers.

A corrected version of the program should directly use the length of the original number's digits, not the length of its string representation. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def is_armstrong(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

This corrected version will properly identify Armstrong numbers for all cases.
