Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This approach accurately determines the number of days in the given month for all potential cases, as evidenced by the test cases in the annotated code. The annotations confirm that the function returns `True` for months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and `False` for those without (February, and the other months). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
