Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given month number contains 30 days by using a set of month numbers `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. This set correctly identifies the months that have 30 days. The function returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for other months. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works correctly for all potential cases within the specified range of month numbers (1 to 12).
