Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a given month has 30 days. It uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days and checks if the input month is in this set. The assertions provided in the problem description cover all the cases where the function should return `True` and `False`, and the code handles these cases correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
