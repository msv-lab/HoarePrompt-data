Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number (ranging from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. It does this by checking if the month number is in the set `months_with_30_days`, which contains the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. These are the months that have 30 days. 

- If the month number is one of these values (4, 6, 9, or 11), the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases also correctly validate the behavior of the function:
- `func_1(6)` should return `True` because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs within the specified range (1 to 12), the program is correct.
