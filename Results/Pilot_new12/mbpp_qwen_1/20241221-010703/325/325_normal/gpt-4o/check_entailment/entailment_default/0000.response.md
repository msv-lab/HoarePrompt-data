Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether the given month number contains 30 days by verifying if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November). The provided test cases `assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, and `assert func_1(12) == False` align with the logic implemented in the function. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given range of month numbers (1 to 12). Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
