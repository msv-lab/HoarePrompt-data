Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days by using a set of month numbers `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. The function returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for other months. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, `assert func_1(12) == False`) validate the correctness of the function for all potential cases within the specified range of month numbers (1 to 12). The annotated code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, indicating that the program meets the requirements.
