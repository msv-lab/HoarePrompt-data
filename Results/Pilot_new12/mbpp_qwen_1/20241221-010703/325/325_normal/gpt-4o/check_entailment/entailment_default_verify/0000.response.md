Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether a given month number contains 30 days by comparing the month number against a set of month numbers `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for others. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, `assert func_1(12) == False`) also validate the function's correctness for the given month numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
