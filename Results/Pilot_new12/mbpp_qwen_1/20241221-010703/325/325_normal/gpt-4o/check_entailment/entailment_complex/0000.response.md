Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number is one of the months that contain 30 days (i.e., April, June, September, and November). It uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store these month numbers and returns `True` if the given `month` is in this set, otherwise it returns `False`.

The provided test cases also align with the problem description:
- `assert func_1(6) == True`: June has 30 days.
- `assert func_1(2) == False`: February does not have 30 days.
- `assert func_1(12) == False`: December does not have 30 days.

Since the function's implementation matches the problem description and all test cases are satisfied, the program is correct.
