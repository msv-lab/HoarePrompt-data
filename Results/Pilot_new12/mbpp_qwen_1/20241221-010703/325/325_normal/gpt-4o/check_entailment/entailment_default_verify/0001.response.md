Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The provided assertions cover the relevant cases:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling all the months with 30 days and correctly returning `False` for the other months. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
