Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not by using a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected results for the months with and without 30 days. The annotated version further confirms that the function behaves as intended, returning `True` for April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), and `False` for other months. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
