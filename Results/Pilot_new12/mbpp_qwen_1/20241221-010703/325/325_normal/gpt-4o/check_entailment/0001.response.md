Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This approach accurately determines the number of days in the given month for all potential cases:

- April (4): Returns `True`
- June (6): Returns `True`
- September (9): Returns `True`
- November (11): Returns `True`
- February (2): Returns `False`
- January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), December (12): All return `False`

Since the function handles all the potential cases as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
