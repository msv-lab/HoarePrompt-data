Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 30 days by checking if the given month number is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which corresponds to April, June, September, and November. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, `assert func_1(12) == False`) correctly validate the function's behavior. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for others, aligning with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
