#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #`The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` within the range 1 to 12 and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11. Otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the given code, as it accurately checks whether the `month` is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).
