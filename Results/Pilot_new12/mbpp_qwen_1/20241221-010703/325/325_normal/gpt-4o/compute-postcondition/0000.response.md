The code creates a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. This set does not affect the value of the `month` variable, which remains an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the new set.

Output State: **month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12; months_with_30_days is {4, 6, 9, 11}**
