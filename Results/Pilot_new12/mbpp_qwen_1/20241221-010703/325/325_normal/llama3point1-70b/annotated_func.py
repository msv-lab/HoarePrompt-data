#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., 4, 6, 9, or 11). If `month` is one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling, as the logic is straightforward and covers all relevant months within the specified range. The function does not perform any additional actions beyond the stated check.
