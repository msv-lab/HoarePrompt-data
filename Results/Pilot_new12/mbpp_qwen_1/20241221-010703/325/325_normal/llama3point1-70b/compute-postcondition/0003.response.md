Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., 4, 6, 9, or 11). If `month` is one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling, as the logic is straightforward and covers all relevant months within the specified range. The function does not perform any additional actions beyond the stated check.**
