The code initializes a list `thirty_days_months` containing the integers `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. This does not affect the value of the `month` variable, which remains an integer such that `1 <= month <= 12`. Therefore, the output state is simply the unchanged state of `month`.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12**
