Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether a given month (represented as an integer between 1 and 12) contains 30 days. The program defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the month numbers that have 30 days. By returning `True` if the input `month` is in this list and `False` otherwise, the program accurately determines whether the given month has 30 days. Since the problem description does not specify any additional requirements (such as handling invalid inputs), and the provided input is assumed to be valid, the program meets the specified criteria.
