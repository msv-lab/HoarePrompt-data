Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, we can see that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number (an integer between 1 and 12) contains 30 days. The months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are the only ones with 30 days, and the program returns `True` for these months and `False` for the rest. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
