Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`, and checks whether `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., 4, 6, 9, or 11). 

- If the `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement to check if the given month number contains 30 days. Since the input `month` is constrained to be between 1 and 12, the function handles all relevant cases without any need for additional error checking or handling. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
