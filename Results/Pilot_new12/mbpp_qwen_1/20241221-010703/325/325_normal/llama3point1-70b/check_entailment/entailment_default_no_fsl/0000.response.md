Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a list of month numbers that contain 30 days and returns `True` if the input month is in this list, and `False` otherwise. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function works correctly for every potential case within the specified range (1 to 12). There are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling, and the logic is straightforward and covers all relevant months. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
