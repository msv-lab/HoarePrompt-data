Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the functionality to check if a given month number contains 30 days. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` within the range 1 to 12 and returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, which indeed have 30 days. For all other months, it returns `False`. Since the program handles all relevant cases as described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases or additional requirements mentioned that would necessitate a change in the assessment, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
