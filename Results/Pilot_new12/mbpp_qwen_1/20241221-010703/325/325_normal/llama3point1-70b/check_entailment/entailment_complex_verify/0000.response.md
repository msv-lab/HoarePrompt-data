Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function returns `True` for the months 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the only months with 30 days according to the problem description. The annotations also state that the function does not require any additional handling for edge cases since the logic is straightforward and covers all relevant months within the specified range. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
