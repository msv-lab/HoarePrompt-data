Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the problem description, months are given as numbers from 1 to 12. The function `func_1` uses a list `thirty_days_months` containing the month numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11. If the input `month` is one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The output hints confirm that this logic is correct and covers all relevant months within the specified range. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
