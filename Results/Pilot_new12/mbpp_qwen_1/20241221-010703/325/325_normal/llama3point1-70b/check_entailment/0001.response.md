Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks if the given month is in the list of months with 30 days. However, it fails to handle the month of February (month number 2), which does not have 30 days. Additionally, it incorrectly classifies other months like September (month number 9) as having 30 days when the description does not specify this. Since the program does not cover all cases, it is incorrect.
