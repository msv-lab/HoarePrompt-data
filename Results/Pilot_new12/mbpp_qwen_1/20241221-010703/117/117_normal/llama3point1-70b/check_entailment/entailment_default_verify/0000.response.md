Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate through each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. This approach ensures that the function accurately counts the integer elements in the list. The output hints further confirm this by explaining how the function works and mentioning potential edge cases such as an empty list, which are handled correctly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
