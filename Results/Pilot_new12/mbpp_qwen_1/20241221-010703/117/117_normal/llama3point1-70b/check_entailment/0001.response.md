Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of integer elements in the given list. Since `sum` will count the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, and `True` is equivalent to 1, this approach correctly counts the number of integer elements. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
