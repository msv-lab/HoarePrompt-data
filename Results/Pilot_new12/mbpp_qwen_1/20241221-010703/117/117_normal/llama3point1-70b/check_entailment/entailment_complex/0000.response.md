Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an input and returns the count of integer elements in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` to check if each element `x` in the list is an integer. The `isinstance()` function returns `True` if `x` is an integer and `False` otherwise. Summing these boolean values counts the number of integer elements in the list. This approach correctly handles all cases mentioned in the problem description, including an empty list, which would result in a sum of 0. Therefore, the program is correct.
