Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` evaluates to `True` for each integer and `False` for non-integer elements. Summing these boolean values gives the count of integer elements. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
