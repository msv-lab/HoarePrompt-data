Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The function iterates through each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. The `sum` function then counts the number of `True` values generated by `isinstance(x, int)`, which effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list. The annotated version also mentions potential edge cases such as an empty list, where the function returns 0, and a list containing non-integer elements only, where the function also returns 0, further supporting the correctness of the function in meeting the problem description.
