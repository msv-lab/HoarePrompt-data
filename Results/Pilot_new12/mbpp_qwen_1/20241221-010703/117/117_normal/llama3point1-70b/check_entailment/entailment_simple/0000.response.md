Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in that list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the number of elements for which `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`. Since the problem description asks for the number of integer elements in a given list, and the provided function accurately counts and returns these elements, the program is correct.
