Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes how the function `func_1` operates. It iterates over each element in the input list `lst`, checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, and then uses `sum` to count the number of `True` values produced by the generator expression. This approach correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list, aligning perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
