Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression within the `sum` function. This approach iterates through each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. Since the function works correctly for any list containing elements of various types (as long as they can be checked with `isinstance`), it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
