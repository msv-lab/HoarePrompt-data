Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to evaluate whether each element in the list is an instance of the `int` class. The `sum` function then counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list. The function handles all potential cases, including an empty list, where it returns 0, and a list containing no integer elements, where it also returns 0. The output hints align perfectly with the functionality of the code, and there are no identified issues that would cause the function to fail for any valid input list.
