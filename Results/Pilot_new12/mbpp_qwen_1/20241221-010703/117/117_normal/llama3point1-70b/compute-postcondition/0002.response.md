Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as a parameter and returns the count of integer elements in the list. It achieves this by evaluating the boolean expression `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in the list `lst`. If `x` is an integer, the expression evaluates to `True`; otherwise, it evaluates to `False`. The function then sums up these boolean values, effectively counting the number of integers in the list. This count is returned as the final result. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function returns 0, and a list containing non-integer elements only, where the function also returns 0.**

The provided code does not have any missing functionality; it correctly implements the described functionality. However, it's worth noting that the term "sum" in the return postconditions might be misleading because the function actually counts the number of integers in the list rather than summing them.
