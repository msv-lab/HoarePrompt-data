Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of integer elements in a given list. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function counts integer elements in a list.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. It checks if each element `x` is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`.
3. **Summation**: For each integer element, `1` is added to the sum, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.
4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions check the function with different inputs and verify that the output is correct:
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`: The list contains two integers (1, 2).
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3`: The list contains three integers (1, 2, 3).
   - `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`: The list contains two integers (1, 4).

Since the function accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list, it correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
