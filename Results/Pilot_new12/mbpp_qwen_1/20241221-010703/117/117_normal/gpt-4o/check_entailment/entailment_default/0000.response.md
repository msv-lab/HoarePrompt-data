Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the list and counts how many of those elements are instances of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. The examples given are:

- `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`: This asserts that there are two integer elements (`1` and `2`) in the list.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3`: This asserts that all three elements in the list are integers.
- `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`: This asserts that there are two integer elements (`1` and `4`) in the list.

These examples cover different scenarios, including lists with non-integer elements, lists with all integer elements, and lists with a mix of integers and non-integers. The code handles these cases correctly and returns the expected count of integer elements. Additionally, the provided output hints confirm that the function works as intended for counting integer elements in a list. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
