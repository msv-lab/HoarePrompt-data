Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate through the list and count the elements that are instances of `int`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A list containing integers and a string: `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]` (expected output: 2)
2. A list containing only integers: `[1, 2, 3]` (expected output: 3)
3. A list containing integers and floats: `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]` (expected output: 2)

These test cases confirm that the function works as expected. Since the function handles all the provided cases correctly and the logic appears to be sound, we can conclude that the program is correct. There do not appear to be any edge cases that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description and test cases.
