Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count how many times the condition `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`. This approach works for all potential cases, including lists with mixed data types, as demonstrated by the test cases:

- The first assertion tests a list containing integers, strings, and a float, correctly returning `2`.
- The second assertion tests a list containing only integers, correctly returning `3`.
- The third assertion tests a list containing integers and floats, correctly returning `2`.

Since the function handles all tested scenarios correctly and the logic appears sound for counting integers in a list, the program is correct.
