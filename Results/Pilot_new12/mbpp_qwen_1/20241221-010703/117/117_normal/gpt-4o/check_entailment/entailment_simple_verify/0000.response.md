Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version supports this assessment by clearly indicating that the function `func_1` iterates over the list `lst` and counts the number of elements that are instances of `int`. The test cases provided cover various scenarios, including lists with integers, strings, and floats, and the function returns the correct number of integer elements in each case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and there is no evidence from the annotated version that suggests the original assessment is incorrect.
