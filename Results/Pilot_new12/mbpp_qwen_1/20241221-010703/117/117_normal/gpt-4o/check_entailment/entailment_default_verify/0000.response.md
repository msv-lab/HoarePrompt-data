Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each element in the list, checks if the element is an integer, and increments the sum accordingly. The function does not modify the input list, and it handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning 0. The test cases provided in the original assessment cover various scenarios, including lists with mixed data types and lists containing only integers or floats. Since the function behaves as expected based on the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
