Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list, checking if it is an instance of the `int` class with `isinstance(x, int)`. If the condition is met, it adds 1 to the sum. 

This approach ensures that the function accurately counts the number of integer elements in the list. The program handles various cases, including lists with no integers (returning 0), lists with all integers (returning the length of the list), and lists with mixed types (correctly counting only the integers). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
