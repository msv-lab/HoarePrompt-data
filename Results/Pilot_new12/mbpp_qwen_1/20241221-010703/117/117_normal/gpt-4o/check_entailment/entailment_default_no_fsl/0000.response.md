Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and check if it is an instance of `int`. The assertions provided cover various cases including lists with integers, mixed types, and even an empty list, which should return 0. Since the code handles these cases appropriately and the provided examples and output hints confirm its correctness, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
