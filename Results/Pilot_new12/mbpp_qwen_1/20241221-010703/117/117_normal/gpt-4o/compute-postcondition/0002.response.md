Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list. Specifically, it iterates through each element in the list, checks if the element is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`, and if true, increments the sum by 1. The function does not modify the input list `lst`; it only examines its contents. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would return 0, and a list containing non-integer elements, where the function would also return 0. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.**
