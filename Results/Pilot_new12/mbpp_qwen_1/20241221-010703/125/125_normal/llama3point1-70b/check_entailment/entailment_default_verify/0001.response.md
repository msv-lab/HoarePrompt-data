Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` splits the input list `lst` into sublists where each sublist contains elements starting from every nth position. The provided output hints further clarify that the function generates `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element starting from indices 0 through n-1. This matches the problem description and ensures that each element in the original list appears exactly once in one of the sublists, regardless of the length of the list relative to `n`. Since the function handles all mentioned edge cases (such as `n` being greater than the list length, `n` being 1, and `n` equal to the list length) and the output hints confirm its expected behavior, the original assessment remains accurate.
