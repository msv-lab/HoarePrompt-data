Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list `lst`, starting from every nth element.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the inputs will be valid (i.e., `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer). Therefore, no additional validation is needed within the function.

2. **List Slicing**: The line `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` uses list comprehension to create sublists. For each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, it slices the list `lst` starting from index `i` with a step size of `n`. This effectively splits the list into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements that are `n` positions apart.

3. **Example Output**: 
   - For `lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, the output would be `[[0, 3, 6, 9], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]]`.
   - For `lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']` and `n = 2`, the output would be `[['a', 'c', 'e'], ['b', 'd']]`.

Since the function correctly implements the described behavior of splitting the list at every nth element, the program is correct according to the problem description.
