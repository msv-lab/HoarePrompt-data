You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to split a list into sublists every nth element. However, it does not handle the case when `n` is greater than the length of the list. In such a case, the program will still create sublists, which may not be intended behavior. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 5`, the program will still produce `[[], [1, 2, 3, 4]]`, which might not align with the expected behavior of splitting every nth element.

To fix this, the program should check if `n` is greater than the length of the list and handle it appropriately. Here's an updated version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    if n > len(lst):
        return [lst]
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This ensures that if `n` is greater than the length of the list, only one sublist containing the entire list is returned.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of any types and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list `lst`, starting from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively. Specifically, the first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. This operation ensures that each element in the original list `lst` appears exactly once in one of the sublists. If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist will contain fewer elements than the others.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
