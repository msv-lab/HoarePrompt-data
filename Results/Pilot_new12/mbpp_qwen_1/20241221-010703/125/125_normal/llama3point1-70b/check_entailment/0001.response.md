Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists, where each sublist contains elements starting from every nth position. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates the desired sublists for any valid positive integer `n`. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including edge cases such as when `n` is greater than the length of the list, when `n` is 1 (which returns the original list as a single sublist), and when `n` is equal to the length of the list (which results in a list of empty sublists). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
