Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of how the function `func_1` operates, and it aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists, where each sublist contains elements starting from every nth position, beginning from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively. The annotations confirm that the function handles various cases, including edge cases like when `n` is greater than the length of the list, when `n` is 1 (returning the original list as a single sublist), and when `n` is equal to the length of the list (resulting in a list of empty sublists). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
