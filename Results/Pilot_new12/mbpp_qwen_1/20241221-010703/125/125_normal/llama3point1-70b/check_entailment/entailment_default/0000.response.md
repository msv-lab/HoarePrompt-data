Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not split the list for every nth element as described in the problem statement. Instead, the code generates a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements starting from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively, with a step size of `n`. For example, if `n=3`, the code would create sublists `[lst[0::3], lst[1::3], lst[2::3]]`, which does not split the list for every nth element as intended. The problem description asks to split the list for every nth element, meaning the function should return a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements at positions 0, n, 2n, 3n, etc. However, the provided code does not achieve this. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
