Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is expected to be a list of any types, and `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer greater than 0. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list `lst`, starting from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively. This structure matches the problem description's requirement.

3. **Sublist Creation**: The line `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` correctly creates the required sublists. 
   - `lst[i::n]` slices the list starting from index `i` and skips `n-1` elements each time.
   - The comprehension iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, ensuring that each sublist starts at a different offset and contains every `n`-th element from that point onwards.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Although the problem description mentions that the input is assumed to be valid (e.g., the list will not be empty, and `n` will be a positive integer), the program inherently handles these cases correctly due to its logic. For instance, if `lst` is an empty list, the output will also be an empty list, and if `n` is 1, all elements will be in a single sublist.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for any valid inputs, the program is correct.
