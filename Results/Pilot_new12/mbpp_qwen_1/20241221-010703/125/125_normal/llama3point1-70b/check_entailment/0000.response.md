Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to split a list into sublists every nth element. However, it does not handle the case when `n` is greater than the length of the list. In such a case, the program will still create sublists, which may not be intended behavior. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 5`, the program will still produce `[[], [1, 2, 3, 4]]`, which might not align with the expected behavior of splitting every nth element.

To fix this, the program should check if `n` is greater than the length of the list and handle it appropriately. Here's an updated version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    if n > len(lst):
        return [lst]
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This ensures that if `n` is greater than the length of the list, only one sublist containing the entire list is returned.
