Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. For any given list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, the function `func_1` creates a list of sublists where each sublist contains every nth element starting from indices 0 to n-1. This matches the output hints and the problem description. Since the hints and the problem description do not indicate any edge cases that the code is missing, and the code handles the described functionality accurately, the program is correct.
