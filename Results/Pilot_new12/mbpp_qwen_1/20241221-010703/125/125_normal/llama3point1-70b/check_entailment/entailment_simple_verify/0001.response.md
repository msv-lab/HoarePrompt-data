Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists, where each sublist contains elements starting from every nth position. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates the desired sublists for any valid positive integer `n`. 

The annotations provided clarify that the function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist starts from an index `i` in the range `[0, n)` and includes every nth element thereafter. This matches the problem description of splitting the list every nth element.

Since the function handles edge cases such as when `n` is greater than the length of the list, when `n` is 1 (returning the original list as a single sublist), and when `n` is equal to the length of the list (resulting in a list of empty sublists), the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
