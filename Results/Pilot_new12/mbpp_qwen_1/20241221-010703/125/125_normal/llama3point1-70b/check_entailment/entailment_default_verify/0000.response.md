Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not handle the case when `n` is greater than the length of the list. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should return a list of sublists where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list. However, the current implementation does not account for the scenario where `n` exceeds the list's length, leading to potentially unexpected results. 

For instance, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 5`, the function currently returns `[[], [1, 2, 3, 4]]`, which does not align with the intended behavior of splitting every `n`-th element. The refined version provided in the original assessment addresses this issue by ensuring that if `n` is greater than the length of the list, only one sublist containing the entire list is returned. This aligns better with the expected functionality described in the problem and output hints.
