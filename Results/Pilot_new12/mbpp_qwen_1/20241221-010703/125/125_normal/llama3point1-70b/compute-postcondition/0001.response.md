The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of any types, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0`. The function returns a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` in steps of 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of lists where each sublist contains every third element from `lst` starting from the index 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
