Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of any types and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list `lst`, starting from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively. Specifically, the first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. This operation ensures that each element in the original list `lst` appears exactly once in one of the sublists. If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist will contain fewer elements than the others.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still generate `n` sublists, but some of these sublists will be empty.
- If `n` is equal to 1, each element of `lst` will appear in its own sublist.
- If `lst` is empty, the function will return an empty list of sublists.

**Missing functionality:**
- The provided annotation and the code do not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 1. In this specific case, the function should ideally return a list where each element of `lst` is in its own sublist. However, the current implementation would still work correctly, just not as efficiently.
