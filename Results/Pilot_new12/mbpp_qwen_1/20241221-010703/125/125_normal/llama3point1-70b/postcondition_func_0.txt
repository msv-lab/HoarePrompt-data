The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of any types and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list `lst`, starting from indices 0, 1, 2, ..., up to `n-1` respectively. Specifically, the first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. This operation ensures that each element in the original list `lst` appears exactly once in one of the sublists. If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist will contain fewer elements than the others.
