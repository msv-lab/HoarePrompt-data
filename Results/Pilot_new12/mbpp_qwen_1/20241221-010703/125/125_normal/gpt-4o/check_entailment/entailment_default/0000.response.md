Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It splits the input list into a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list. The function uses a loop to iterate through the elements of the input list and appends each element to the corresponding sublist based on the modulo operation with `n`. This ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the sublists.

Given the examples and the output hints, the code works correctly for all potential cases. The function handles the distribution of elements as expected and produces the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
