Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to split a list into sublists at every nth element. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list and distributes elements into sublists based on the modulo operation, which aligns with the problem description. The assertions given cover multiple scenarios, including different list lengths and values of n, and the implementation ensures that elements are evenly distributed across the sublists. Since the output hints and the original assessment match the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
