Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists, each containing elements that are nth apart from each other. The examples given cover different list sizes and values of `n`, and the function works as expected in all cases. For any given list and integer `n`, the function divides the list into `n` sublists, ensuring that each element in the original list appears in exactly one sublist, and the sublists contain elements that are nth apart from each other. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario where the function fails to meet the problem description.
