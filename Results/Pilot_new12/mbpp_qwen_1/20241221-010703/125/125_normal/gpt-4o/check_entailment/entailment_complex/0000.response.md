Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each element in `lst` is placed into one of the sublists based on the index determined by `i % n`.

2. **Implementation**: 
   - The function initializes a list `result` of `n` empty sublists.
   - It iterates over each element in `lst` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element itself.
   - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist at the index determined by `i % n`.
   
3. **Edge Cases**: The provided assertions cover different scenarios including:
   - Lists with a mix of strings and integers.
   - Different values of `n` relative to the length of the list.
   - Ensuring all elements are distributed according to the modulo operation with `n`.

4. **Assumptions**: The program assumes that `lst` is a non-empty list and `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\). These assumptions align with the problem description.

Given these points, the program consistently adheres to the problem description for any valid input, making it correct.
