Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The annotations confirm that the function initializes a list of `n` empty sublists, iterates through the input list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the element, and appends elements to the appropriate sublist based on the index modulo `n`. After the loop, the function returns a list of `n` sublists containing the elements as specified. The provided assertions cover various cases, and the code logic matches the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
