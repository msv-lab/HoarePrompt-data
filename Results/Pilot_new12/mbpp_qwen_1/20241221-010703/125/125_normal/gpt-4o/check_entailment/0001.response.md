Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The assertions provided in the problem description cover several cases, including different list lengths and various values of n. The implementation uses a loop to iterate through the list and appends elements to the appropriate sublist based on their index modulo n. This approach ensures that elements are distributed evenly across the sublists, matching the problem description. Since no counterexamples were found, the program appears to handle all described cases correctly.
