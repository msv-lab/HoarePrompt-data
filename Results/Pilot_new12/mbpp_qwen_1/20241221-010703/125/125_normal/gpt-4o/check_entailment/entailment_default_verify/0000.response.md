Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists such that each element in the original list appears in exactly one of the sublists, and the elements are distributed according to the modulo operation with `n`. The provided assertions and the explanation in the output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended for the given scenarios. There is no evidence in the code or the provided information suggesting that the function fails to meet the problem description under valid inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
