Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature and Inputs**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `n` (an integer). This matches the expected inputs as per the problem description.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function is expected to split the input list `lst` into sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element from the original list. The provided function achieves this by using a list comprehension to create `n` empty sublists, and then iterating over the elements of `lst`. For each element, it appends the element to the sublist corresponding to the current index modulo `n`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The line `result[i % n].append(element)` ensures that elements are distributed evenly across the `n` sublists based on the modulo operation, which is exactly what is required to split the list every nth element.

4. **Examples**:
   - The provided assertions correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. For example, when `lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n = 3`, the function returns `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`, which is consistent with the requirement to split the list every third element.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem statement assumes valid inputs. Given these assumptions, the function correctly handles all potential cases where `lst` is a non-empty list and `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).

Since the program accurately follows the specified requirements and correctly handles the provided examples, the program is correct according to the problem description.
