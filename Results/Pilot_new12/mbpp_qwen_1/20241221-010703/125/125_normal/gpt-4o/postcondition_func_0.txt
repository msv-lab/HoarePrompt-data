The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`. Specifically, it creates a list `result` of `n` empty sublists and then iterates over each element in `lst`. For each element, it appends the element to the sublist at the index determined by the modulo operation (`i % n`). This means that the first `n` elements of `lst` will be distributed among the `n` sublists, and this process wraps around `n` times, ensuring all elements from `lst` are included in the sublists. The function handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, and each element in `lst` will appear in exactly one of the sublists in `result`. If `n` were greater than the length of `lst`, the remaining sublists would be empty.
