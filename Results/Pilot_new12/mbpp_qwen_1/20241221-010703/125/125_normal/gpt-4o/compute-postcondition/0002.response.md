Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `lst` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).
   - `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `element` is the first element of `lst`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   result[i % n].append(element)
   ```

3. First, let's evaluate the expression `i % n`:
   - Since `i` is 0, `0 % n` is 0. So, `result[0]` will be accessed.

4. Now, `result[0].append(element)` appends `element` to the first list in `result`. Initially, `result[0]` is an empty list, so after appending `element`, `result[0]` becomes `[element]`.

5. The variables that are updated are `result[0]` (now `[element]`), and `i` remains 0 since the code does not change its value.

Output State: **`lst` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\), `result` is a list of `n` empty lists with the first list containing `[element]`, `i` is 0, and `element` is the first element of `lst`.**
