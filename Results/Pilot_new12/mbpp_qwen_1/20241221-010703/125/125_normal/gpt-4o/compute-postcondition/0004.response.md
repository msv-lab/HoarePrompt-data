Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `lst` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).
   - `result` is a list of `n` empty lists with the first list containing `[element]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `element` is the second element of `lst`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `result[i % n].append(element)`
     - Since `i` is 1, `i % n` will evaluate to 1 (as long as `n` is greater than 0).
     - `result[1]` refers to the second list in `result`, which is initially empty.
     - `element` is the second element of `lst`, let's denote this as `second_element`.
     - The line `result[1].append(second_element)` appends `second_element` to the second list in `result`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `lst` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `result` is updated: the second list now contains `[second_element]`.
   - `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `i`.
   - `element` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `element`.

4. **Updated Values:**
   - `result` is now a list of `n` empty lists, except for the second list, which now contains `[second_element]`.
   - All other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`lst` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\), `result` is a list of `n` empty lists with the second list containing `[element]`, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element of `lst`.**
