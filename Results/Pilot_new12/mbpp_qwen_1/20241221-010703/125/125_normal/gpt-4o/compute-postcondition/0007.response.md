Output State: **`lst` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\), `result` is a list of `n` sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`, `i` is the last index processed by the loop, and `element` is the element at index `i` in `lst`.** 

### Explanation:
- **lst**: The input list remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **n**: The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- **result**: After the loop completes, each sublist in `result` will contain elements from `lst` such that the elements are distributed among the `n` sublists according to the modulo operation (`i % n`). Specifically, the `i`-th element of `lst` (where `i` starts from 0) will be appended to the sublist at index `i % n` in `result`.
- **i**: The final value of `i` will be `len(lst) - 1`, as the loop iterates from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
- **element**: The final value of `element` will be the last element in `lst`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `result` will be a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` distributed based on the modulo operation with `n`.
