The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(lst)\). After executing the function body, it returns a list `result` of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists containing elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists containing elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.**
