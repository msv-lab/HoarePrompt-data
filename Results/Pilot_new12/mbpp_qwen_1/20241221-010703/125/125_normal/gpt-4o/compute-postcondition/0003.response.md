According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `lst`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).
- `result` is a list of `n` empty lists with the first list containing `[element]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `element` is the first element of `lst`.

Given these conditions, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `len(lst)`.
- The `element` will be the next element in the list `lst` after the first one.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`lst` is a non-empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\), `result` is a list of `n` empty lists with the first list containing `[element]`, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element of `lst`.**
