The code creates a complex number using the `real` and `imag` values. The `real` and `imag` values are used as arguments to the `complex()` function to create the `complex_num`. After the creation, the `real` and `imag` values remain unchanged, and a new variable `complex_num` is introduced with the value of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is a complex number with real part equal to `real` and imaginary part equal to `imag`**
