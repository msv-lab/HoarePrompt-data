The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with the real part equal to `real` and the imaginary part equal to `imag`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part equal to `real` and imaginary part equal to `imag`.**
