Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(real, imag)` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function from the `cmath` module. Given the problem description to get the angle of a complex number, this function adheres to the requirement for any real and imaginary inputs. Since the function uses a built-in method to compute the phase, it will handle all valid complex numbers accurately, including zero and non-zero real and imaginary parts. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the provided code that would cause it to fail under any circumstances described in the problem statement.
