Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase()` function. The state annotations indicate that `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers, which are appropriate inputs for constructing a complex number. The function then correctly returns the phase angle of the constructed complex number. Given the problem description and the annotations, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
