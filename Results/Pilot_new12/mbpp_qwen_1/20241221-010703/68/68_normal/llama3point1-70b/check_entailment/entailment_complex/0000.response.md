Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It creates a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. 

- The function correctly creates a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts.
- It uses the `cmath.phase` function to compute the phase angle, which is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane.
- The function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, ensuring the correct phase angle is returned. 
- Although no explicit edge cases are mentioned in the annotation, the implicit handling of the case where the complex number is not zero (i.e., at least one of `real` or `imag` is non-zero) is appropriate, and the phase angle of a zero complex number (where both `real` and `imag` are zero) is correctly handled by `cmath.phase`, which returns 0.

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
