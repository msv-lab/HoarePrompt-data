Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the angle (or argument) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, constructs a complex number from these values, and returns its phase. Since the `cmath.phase()` function is designed to handle all valid complex numbers, this implementation will work correctly for all potential cases where a real and an imaginary part are provided. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
