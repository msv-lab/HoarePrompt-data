Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, constructs a complex number from these parts, and returns the phase angle. The annotation mentions that the function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, and it correctly states that if both `real` and `imag` are zero, the phase angle would be 0, which is correctly handled by the `cmath.phase` function. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
