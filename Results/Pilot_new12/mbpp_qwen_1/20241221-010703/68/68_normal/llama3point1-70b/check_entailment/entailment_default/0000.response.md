Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The code handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, ensuring the correct phase angle is returned. Additionally, the `cmath.phase` function correctly handles the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, returning a phase angle of 0. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the problem description, but the provided code implicitly covers these scenarios. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described.
