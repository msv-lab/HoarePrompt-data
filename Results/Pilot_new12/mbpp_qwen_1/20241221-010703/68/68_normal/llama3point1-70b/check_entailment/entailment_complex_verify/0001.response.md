Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotated version. The function `func_1(real, imag)` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, and it correctly returns the phase angle in radians. The annotation also implicitly covers the case where the complex number is not zero (i.e., at least one of `real` or `imag` is non-zero), and the `cmath.phase` function handles the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero by returning 0. Since the problem description requires getting the angle of a complex number, and the function provided fulfills this requirement without any apparent edge cases or logical flaws, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
