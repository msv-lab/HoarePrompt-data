Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the function does exactly that. The output hints mention that the function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, and it also correctly handles the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, returning a phase angle of 0. Since the hints and the code itself cover all described cases, the function is correct for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
