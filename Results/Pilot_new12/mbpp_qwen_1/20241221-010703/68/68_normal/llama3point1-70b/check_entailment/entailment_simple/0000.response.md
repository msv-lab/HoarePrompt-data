Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these parts and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. 

Given the problem description to "Write a function to get the angle of a complex number," the provided program accurately fulfills this requirement by returning the phase angle of the specified complex number. Since the problem does not require handling of invalid inputs (as per the assumption), the program meets all necessary criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.
