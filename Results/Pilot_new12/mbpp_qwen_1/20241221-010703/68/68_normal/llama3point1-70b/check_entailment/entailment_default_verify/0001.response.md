Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided Python function `func_1(real, imag)` adheres to the problem description of getting the angle (phase) of a complex number. The function uses the `cmath.phase()` method from the `cmath` module, which is designed to calculate the phase angle of a complex number accurately. The output hints further confirm that the function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, and it implicitly covers the case where the complex number is not zero. Since the function uses a built-in method and there are no edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotation that would cause it to fail, the original assessment is accurate.
