Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, and correctly returns the phase angle even when both `real` and `imag` are zero, as `cmath.phase(0+0j)` returns `0`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the output hints, but the implicit handling of the zero complex number scenario by `cmath.phase` ensures the program meets the requirements for all potential valid inputs.
