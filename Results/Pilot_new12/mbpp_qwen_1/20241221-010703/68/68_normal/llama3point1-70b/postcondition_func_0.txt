The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It creates a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The function handles the general case where both `real` and `imag` are provided and non-null, ensuring the correct phase angle is returned. No edge cases are explicitly mentioned in the annotation, but it implicitly covers the case where the complex number is not zero (i.e., at least one of `real` or `imag` is non-zero). If both `real` and `imag` are zero, the phase angle would be 0, which is correctly handled by the `cmath.phase` function.
