Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle (in radians) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotated version confirms that the function takes two parameters (`real` and `imag`) representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and returns the phase angle of the constructed complex number. The provided assertions also validate the function against known values, indicating that the function behaves as expected. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
