Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase angle of a complex number, which is the correct approach. The provided output hints further clarify that the function handles valid real and imaginary inputs and returns the correct phase angle. Since the test cases in the original assessment pass and the output hints confirm the function's expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate. The function meets the problem description and handles all valid inputs appropriately.
