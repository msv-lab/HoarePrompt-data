Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It accepts the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the angle (phase) of the complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The test cases provided in the output hints confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the current implementation does not handle, assuming valid inputs as specified. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
