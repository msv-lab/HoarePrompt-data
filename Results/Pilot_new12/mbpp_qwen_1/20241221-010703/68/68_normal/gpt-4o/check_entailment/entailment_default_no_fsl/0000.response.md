Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function uses the `cmath.phase()` method, which correctly computes the phase angle of a complex number. The assertions in the code verify the correctness of the function with the given test cases. The output hints confirm that the function handles all valid real and imaginary inputs correctly. Since the code meets the requirements for the given problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly, the program is correct.
