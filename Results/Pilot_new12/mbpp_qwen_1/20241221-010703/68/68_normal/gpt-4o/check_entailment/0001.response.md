Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which is the correct approach. The test cases provided verify that the function works correctly for the given inputs:

1. For the complex number `0 + 1j`, the expected angle is approximately `1.5708` radians (90 degrees).
2. For the complex number `2 + 1j`, the expected angle is approximately `0.4636` radians.
3. For the complex number `0 + 2j`, the expected angle is again approximately `1.5708` radians.

Since the function uses the built-in `cmath.phase` method and the test cases pass, the function appears to be correct for the described problem. There do not appear to be any edge cases or additional test cases needed to disprove its correctness.
