Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then constructs a complex number using these parts and returns its phase angle (the angle in radians).

The program includes assertions to verify that the function works correctly for different inputs:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` should return approximately 1.5708 radians (which is π/2).
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` should return approximately 0.4636 radians.
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` should also return approximately 1.5708 radians (since the imaginary part is 2 and the real part is 0, the angle is still π/2).

The function uses the `cmath.phase()` method, which correctly computes the phase angle of a complex number. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function is implemented correctly and meets the requirements specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
