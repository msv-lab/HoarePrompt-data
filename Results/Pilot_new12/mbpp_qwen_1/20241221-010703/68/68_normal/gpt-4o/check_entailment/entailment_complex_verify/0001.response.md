Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The provided test cases verify that the function works correctly for the given inputs. The annotations also confirm that the function handles valid real and imaginary inputs and returns the correct phase angle. Since there are no issues identified in the annotated version, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
