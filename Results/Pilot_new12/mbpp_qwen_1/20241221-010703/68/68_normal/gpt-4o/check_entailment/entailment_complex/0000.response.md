Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It constructs a complex number using these parameters and then calculates the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. 

The program does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`cmath` and `math`).
2. Provides assertions to verify that the function `func_1` returns the expected phase angles for given complex numbers. These assertions check if the computed phase angles are close to the expected values within a relative tolerance of 0.001, which is appropriate for floating-point comparisons.
3. Defines the function `func_1` that:
   - Constructs a complex number from the given `real` and `imag` parameters.
   - Computes and returns the phase angle of the constructed complex number using `cmath.phase()`.

Since the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and passes the provided test cases, it is correct.
