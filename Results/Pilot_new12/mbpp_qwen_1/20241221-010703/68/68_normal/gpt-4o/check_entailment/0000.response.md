Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The examples given also match the expected results within a reasonable tolerance. Since the function `func_1` accurately computes the phase of a complex number for the given test cases, and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all tested scenarios.
