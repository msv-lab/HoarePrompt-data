Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then creates a complex number using these parameters and returns the phase angle of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the correct phase angles for the given inputs, which are verified to be correct based on the expected values. Since the function uses the correct method (`cmath.phase`) to calculate the angle and the test cases pass, the function is indeed correct for the described problem. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
