Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts and then computes its phase angle. The assertions in the program verify that the function works as expected for the given test cases, and there are no issues with handling invalid inputs as per the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
