#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The function constructs a complex number using these parameters and then computes its phase angle using the `cmath.phase()` function. The phase angle is the angle (in radians) from the positive real axis to the line representing the complex number in the complex plane. The function handles all valid real and imaginary inputs and returns the correct phase angle. Potential edge cases include when `real` or `imag` are not valid real numbers, although such cases are not explicitly handled in the code.
