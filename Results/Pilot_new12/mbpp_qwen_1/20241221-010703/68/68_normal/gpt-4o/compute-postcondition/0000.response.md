The code creates a complex number using the `real` and `imag` values. The `real` and `imag` variables remain unchanged, but a new variable `complex_number` is created and assigned the value of the complex number formed from `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `complex_number` with the value of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`.

Output State: **`real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_number` is a complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`**
