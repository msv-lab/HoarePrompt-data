The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with the real part `real` and the imaginary part `imag`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and return the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number.
