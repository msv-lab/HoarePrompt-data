The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integers). It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would return 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
