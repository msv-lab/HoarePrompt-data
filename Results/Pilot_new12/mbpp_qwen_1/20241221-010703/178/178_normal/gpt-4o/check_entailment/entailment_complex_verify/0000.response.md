Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as intended. The annotated version supports this by explicitly stating the steps taken by the function and noting that there are no missing functionalities for the given scope of the problem. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
