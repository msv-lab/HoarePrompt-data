Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the specified cases correctly, including the potential edge case of an empty list, which results in a return value of 0. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is maintained.
