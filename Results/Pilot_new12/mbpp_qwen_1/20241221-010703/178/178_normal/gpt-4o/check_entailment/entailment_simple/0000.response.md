Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the list, and returns the result. The assertions provided also validate that the function works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
