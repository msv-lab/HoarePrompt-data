Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as correct.
