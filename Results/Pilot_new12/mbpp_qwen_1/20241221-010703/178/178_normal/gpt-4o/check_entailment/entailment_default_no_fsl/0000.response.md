Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. The assertions provided cover various scenarios, including lists with floating-point numbers, lists with only integers, and an empty list (which would return 0). Since the code handles these cases correctly and the output hints confirm there are no missing functionalities, the code is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
