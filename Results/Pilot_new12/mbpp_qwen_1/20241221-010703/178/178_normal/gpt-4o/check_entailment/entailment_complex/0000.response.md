Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (which can be floating-point or integer values), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The returned result is consistent with the problem description. Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning 0, which is also correct according to the problem description. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs.
