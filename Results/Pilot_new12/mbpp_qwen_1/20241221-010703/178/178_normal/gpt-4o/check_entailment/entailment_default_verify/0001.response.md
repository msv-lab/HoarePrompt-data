Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the program's implementation. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, sums these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The output hints also align with the functionality of the program, indicating that it handles the expected inputs and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
