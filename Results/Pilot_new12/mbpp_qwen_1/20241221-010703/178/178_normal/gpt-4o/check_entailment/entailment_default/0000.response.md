Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The assertions provided in the function definition also support this behavior. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the code would fail to meet the requirements. The code handles both floating-point and integer inputs appropriately and produces the correct output as per the examples given.
