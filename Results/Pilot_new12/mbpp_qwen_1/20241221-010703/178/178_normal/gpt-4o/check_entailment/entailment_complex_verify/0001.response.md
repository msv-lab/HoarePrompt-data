Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly performs the following steps:
1. Rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer.
2. Calculates the sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Multiplies the sum by the length of the list.
4. Returns the result.

The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as described in the problem statement. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Since there are no logical errors or omissions in the function that could lead to incorrect results, and the function handles the specified operations correctly, the original assessment is correct.
