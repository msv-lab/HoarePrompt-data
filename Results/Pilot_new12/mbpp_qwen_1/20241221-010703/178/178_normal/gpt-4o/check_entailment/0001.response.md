Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for all tested cases. It rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. For the input `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, the output is `243`.
2. For the input `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, the output is `345`.
3. For the input `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, the output is `513`.

Since the function handles the rounding, summing, and multiplication correctly in all tested cases, and no edge cases or potential issues were found, the program is correct.
