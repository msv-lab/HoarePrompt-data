The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` by applying the `round()` function to each element in the `numbers` list. This means that each element in `rounded_numbers` will be the rounded integer value of the corresponding element in `numbers`. The original `numbers` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded integer values of the elements in `numbers`.**
