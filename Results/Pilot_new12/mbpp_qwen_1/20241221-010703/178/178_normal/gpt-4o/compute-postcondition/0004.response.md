The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers. After processing, the function calculates the result as `total_sum * len(numbers)`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` (assuming each element in `numbers` is rounded to the nearest integer) and `len(numbers)` is the length of the `numbers` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers, round each number to the nearest integer, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers, multiply it by the length of the list, and return the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies it by the length of the list, and returns the result.**
