`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`. The elements in `rounded_numbers` are already the rounded integer values of the elements in `numbers`, so `total_sum` will be the sum of these rounded integers. However, the exact value of `total_sum` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in `numbers`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded integer values of the elements in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded integer values of the elements in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`**.
