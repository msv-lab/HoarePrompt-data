#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result which is calculated as total_sum * len(numbers), where total_sum is the sum of the elements in rounded_numbers and len(numbers) is the length of the numbers list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integers). It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would return 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
