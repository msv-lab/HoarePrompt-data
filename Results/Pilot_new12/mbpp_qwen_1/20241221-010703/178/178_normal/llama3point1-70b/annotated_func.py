#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the total sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` multiplied by the length of the `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of floating-point or integer numbers. It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. Potential edge cases include handling an empty list, where the function would return 0, and considering the rounding behavior of floating-point numbers. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that all elements in the input list are either integers or can be converted to floats without issues.
