Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (floating-point or integers), rounds each number to the nearest integer, sums these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the original list. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected, handling potential edge cases such as an empty list by returning 0. Since the provided code meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
