Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number to the nearest integer using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. The program handles the case of an empty list by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list of rounded numbers would be 0, and multiplying this by the length of the list (which is also 0) results in 0. The program also implicitly handles the assumption that the input will be valid, as specified in the instructions. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
