Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by rounding each number in the given list, calculating the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplying this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles an empty list appropriately by returning 0 and considers the rounding behavior of floating-point numbers. Since the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases beyond these points, and the provided code does not introduce any errors or missing functionalities, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
