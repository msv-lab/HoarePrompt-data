Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of floating-point or integer numbers. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Rounding Numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and applies the `round()` function to each element, storing the result in the `rounded_numbers` list. This step correctly rounds each number in the list.

3. **Calculating Total Sum**: The program then calculates the sum of the `rounded_numbers` list using the `sum()` function, which is a standard and correct approach.

4. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum by the length of the original `numbers` list. This is exactly as required by the problem description.

5. **Output**: The function returns the calculated value, which is the total sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

Since the program performs all the necessary steps as described in the problem statement without any additional or missing steps, it can be considered correct according to the given problem description.
