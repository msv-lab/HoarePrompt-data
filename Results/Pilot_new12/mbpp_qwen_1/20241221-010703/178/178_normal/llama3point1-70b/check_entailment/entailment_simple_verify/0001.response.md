Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided problem description both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The annotations align with the expected behavior of the function, and there are no contradictions or additional issues highlighted by the annotations that would necessitate a change in the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
