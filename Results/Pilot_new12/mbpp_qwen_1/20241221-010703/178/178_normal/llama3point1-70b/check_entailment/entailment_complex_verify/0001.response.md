Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to round each number in the given list, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiply this sum by the length of the list. The annotations confirm that the function handles the input as a list of floating-point or integer numbers, rounds each number appropriately, calculates the total sum, and returns the result as specified. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotations that would cause the function to fail under valid input conditions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
