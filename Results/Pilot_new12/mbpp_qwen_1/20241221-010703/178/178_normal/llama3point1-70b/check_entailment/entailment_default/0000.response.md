Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. The code handles an empty list by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description. Additionally, the code assumes that all elements in the input list are either integers or can be converted to floats without issues, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints. The output hints confirm that the code behaves as expected for all potential cases mentioned.
