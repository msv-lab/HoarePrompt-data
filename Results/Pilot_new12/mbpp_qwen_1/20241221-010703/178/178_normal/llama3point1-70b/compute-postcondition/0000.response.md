The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in the original `numbers` list. The original list `numbers` remains unchanged. 

Since the exact values in `numbers` are not specified, the output state will reflect that `numbers` is still a list of floating-point or integer numbers, and `rounded_numbers` is a new list where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`.**
