The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers. After processing, the function returns the total sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` (which is derived from `numbers`) multiplied by the length of the `numbers` list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `numbers` of floating-point or integer numbers, round each element in the list, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers, multiply this sum by the length of the original list, and return the result. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, rounds each element in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the list, and returns the result.**
