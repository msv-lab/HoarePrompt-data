The code `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)` calculates the sum of the elements in the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. This does not affect the `numbers` list or the `rounded_numbers` list directly, but it introduces a new variable `total_sum` with the sum of the rounded numbers.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`**.
