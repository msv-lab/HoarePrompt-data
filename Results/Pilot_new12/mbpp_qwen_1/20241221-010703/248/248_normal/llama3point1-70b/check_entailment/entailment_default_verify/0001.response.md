Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a given list into a tuple and returns it. The output hints confirm that the function handles the conversion properly for any valid list input, including empty lists and lists with duplicate elements. Since the problem description asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple, and the provided code fulfills this requirement without any edge cases or missing functionalities, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
