Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program `func_1` meets the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The annotated version supports this by confirming that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., always a list), the program does not need to handle invalid inputs, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
