Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. This directly follows the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. Since the function works correctly for any list input (including empty lists and lists with duplicate elements), there are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.
