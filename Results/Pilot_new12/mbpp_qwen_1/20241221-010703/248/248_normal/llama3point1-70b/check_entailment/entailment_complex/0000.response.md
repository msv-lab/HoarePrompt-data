Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It accepts a list `input_list` as a parameter and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This exactly matches the problem description which states that the function should convert a list to a tuple. Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., always a list), there are no edge cases or scenarios to consider that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
