Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The return statement `return tuple(input_list)` correctly performs this conversion. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list), the program will always produce a tuple as output, thus satisfying the problem description in all cases.
