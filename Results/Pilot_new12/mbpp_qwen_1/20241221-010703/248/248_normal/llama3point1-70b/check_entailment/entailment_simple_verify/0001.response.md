Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts a given list into a tuple as per the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the annotation that would indicate the function fails to meet the requirement under any circumstances. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
