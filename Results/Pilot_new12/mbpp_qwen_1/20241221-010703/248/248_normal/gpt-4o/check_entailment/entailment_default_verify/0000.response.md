Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple` function. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, converting the list into a tuple without any issues. The provided assertions also validate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with different lengths and values. Since there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
