Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to perform this conversion. All the provided test cases show that the function returns the expected results. Since the function behaves as expected for the given inputs and there are no indications of missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
