Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description exactly. The function `func_1` takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the elements of that list. This is precisely what the problem description asks for. The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and there are no additional checks or assumptions required. Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., always a list), the function handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
