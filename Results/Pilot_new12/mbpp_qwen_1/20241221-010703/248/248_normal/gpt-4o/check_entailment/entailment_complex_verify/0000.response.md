Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple` function. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The annotations support this by clearly indicating that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified in the annotated version, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
