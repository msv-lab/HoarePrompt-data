Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The function body simply converts the list to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including lists with different lengths and repeated elements. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the problem description only requires converting a list to a tuple, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case under the given assumptions.
