Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The provided test cases also show that the function returns the expected results. Since the function behaves as expected for the given inputs and there are no indications of missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct. The annotations further support this by clearly indicating the state of the program and the behavior of the function.
