Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list using the `tuple()` function. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
