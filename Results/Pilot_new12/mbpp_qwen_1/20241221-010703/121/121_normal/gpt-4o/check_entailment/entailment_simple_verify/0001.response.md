Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The original assessment is accurate because the provided function follows a specific recurrence relation that results in a sequence different from the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence. For example, when `n = 4`, the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 29, but the function returns 17, which is incorrect. The annotations confirm that the function returns a value based on a recurrence relation rather than generating Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, thus the program does not meet the problem description for all cases.
