Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Based on the output hints, the function uses a specific recurrence relation to generate a sequence, which is not the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The output hints indicate that for `n = 4`, the function returns 17 instead of the expected 29. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for generating Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.
