Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Instead, it appears to implement a different mathematical formula involving powers of 2 and division by -7. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem description asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. These primes are generated from a specific recurrence relation and have a particular form related to Fermat numbers. 

2. **Provided Code Logic**:
   - The code initializes `S0` and `S1` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `S0` and `S1` according to the formula \( S_{\text{next}} = 2 \cdot S1 + S0 \).
   - Finally, it returns `S1`.

3. **Mathematical Formula**: The formula used in the code is:
   \[
   S1 = \frac{-2^n + 1}{-7} \times \frac{-2^n - 1}{-7}
   \]
   This does not match the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which are related to the sequence \(P_n = 2^{2^n} + 1\) (Fermat numbers).

4. **Newman–Shanks–Williams Primes**: These primes are derived from a specific sequence related to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primality test, which involves checking certain conditions on sequences generated from the recurrence relation of the form:
   \[
   P_{n+1} = (2^{2^n} + 1)^2 - 2
   \]

Given these points, the provided code does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes but instead computes a different mathematical expression. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
