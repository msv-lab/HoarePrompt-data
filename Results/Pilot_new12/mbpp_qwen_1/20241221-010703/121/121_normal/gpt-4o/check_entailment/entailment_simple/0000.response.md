Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the provided program does not implement this functionality. Instead, the program generates a sequence of numbers using a recurrence relation and returns the last number in the sequence. 

The recurrence relation used in the program is:
\[ S_{\text{next}} = 2S_1 + S_0 \]

with initial values:
\[ S_0 = 1, \quad S_1 = 1 \]

After \( n-1 \) iterations, the program returns \( S_1 \), which is computed as:
\[ S_1 = \left(\frac{-2^n + 1}{-7}\right) \times \left(\frac{-2^n - 1}{-7}\right) \]

However, this does not correspond to the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and the program's logic does not generate these primes. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
