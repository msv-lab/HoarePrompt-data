Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Instead, it generates a sequence based on a recurrence relation. According to the problem description, we need to generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers, which are defined as follows:

The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are: 2, 3, 7, 29, 41, 239, ...

However, the provided function starts with initial values `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 1`, and uses the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. This results in a different sequence: 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, ...

For example, when `n = 3`, the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 7, but the function returns 7, which is correct in this case. However, for `n = 4`, the expected value is 29, but the function returns 17, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
