Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the code implements a different sequence defined by the recurrence relation \(S_{next} = 2S_1 + S_0\), starting with \(S_0 = 1\) and \(S_1 = 1\). This sequence does not generate the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

The output hints also suggest a different formula, \(\frac{-2^n + 1}{-7} \times \frac{-2^n - 1}{-7}\), which further confirms that the code does not meet the problem description. Specifically, the values returned by the code do not match the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers for \(n = 3, 4, 5\):

- For \(n = 3\), the code returns 17, but the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 29.
- For \(n = 4\), the code returns 41, but the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 89.
- For \(n = 5\), the code returns 41, but the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 239.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.
