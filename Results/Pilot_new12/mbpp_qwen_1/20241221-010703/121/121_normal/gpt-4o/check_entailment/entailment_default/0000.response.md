Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not actually calculate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Instead, it appears to be implementing a recurrence relation. The function `func_1` is defined to return values based on a specific formula involving `S0` and `S1`, but this does not match the problem description of finding Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

The output hints suggest that the function returns a value calculated using a specific formula, but this does not align with the problem description of finding prime numbers. Specifically, the output hints state that the function returns values based on a recurrence relation, whereas the problem description requires the function to return Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

Since the function does not implement the logic required to find Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers, the program is incorrect.
