`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial state, we know that `S0` is \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\) and `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\). Substituting these into the equation:

\[ S_next = 2 \left(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\right) + \left(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\right) \]
\[ S_next = -\frac{10}{7} \times S0 - \frac{6}{7} \times S0 \]
\[ S_next = -\frac{16}{7} \times S0 \]

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\), `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\), `S_next` is \(-\frac{16}{7} \times S0**.
