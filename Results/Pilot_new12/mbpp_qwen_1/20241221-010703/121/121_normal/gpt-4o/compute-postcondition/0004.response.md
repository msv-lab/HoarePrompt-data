Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `n`: A positive integer and neither 0 nor 1.
   - `S0`: Initially 1.
   - `S1`: Initially 1.
   - `i`: The loop variable.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will take values starting from `2` up to `n`.

3. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to start executing, the initial value of `i` should be `2`, and the condition `2 <= i <= n` must hold true.
   - Given that `n` is a positive integer and neither 0 nor 1, `n` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` must start at `2`, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.
   - `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be 2.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**.
