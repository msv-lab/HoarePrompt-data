Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `S0` is the original value of `S1`.
   - `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the current state:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and checked against `n + 1`.

4. **Update the state:**
   - `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - To check if the loop continues, we need to ensure that `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the loop will continue if `3 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 (and now it must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to continue).

6. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `S0` remains the same as it was before.
   - `S1` remains `2 * S1 + S0` because the loop body is omitted and no changes were made to `S1` or `S0`.

Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `S0` is the original value of `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`**
