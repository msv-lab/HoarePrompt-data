Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `S0` is \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\)
   - `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\)

2. **Understand the for loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n+1`, inclusive.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 3 (since it was 3 at the end of the previous iteration) and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop runs from 2 to `n+1`, and `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will continue if `i < n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `4` (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Update the states:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `i` is updated to 4.
   - The expressions for `S0` and `S1` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Final State:**
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 4
- `S0` remains \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\)
- `S1` remains \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\)

**Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\), `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\)**
