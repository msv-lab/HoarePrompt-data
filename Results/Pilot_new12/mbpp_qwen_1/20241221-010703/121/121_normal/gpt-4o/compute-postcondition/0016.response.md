Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer. It returns 1 if `n` is either 0 or 1. For any other positive integer value of `n`, it calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{-2^n + 1}{-7} \times \frac{-2^n - 1}{-7}\).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0 or 1, the function directly returns 1.
- For any other positive integer value of `n`, the function correctly computes the value using the given formula within the for loop.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest a specific transformation of `S0` and `S1` after the for loop, but the actual code does not perform these transformations. The values of `S0` and `S1` after the loop are simply returned without applying the transformations mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the annotations might be incorrect or misleading regarding the transformations of `S0` and `S1`. The function correctly calculates the value based on the formula but does not modify `S0` and `S1` as stated in the annotations.
