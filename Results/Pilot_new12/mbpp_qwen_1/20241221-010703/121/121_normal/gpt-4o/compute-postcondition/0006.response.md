The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` updates the values of `S0` and `S1`. Initially, `S_next` is defined as `2 * S1 + S0`. Let's update these variables step by step.

1. The initial values are:
   - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`
   - `S0` is in its initial state
   - `S1` is in its initial state
   - `i` is 2 (unchanged)
   - `n` must be at least 2 (unchanged)

2. After executing `S0, S1 = S1, S_next`:
   - `S0` now takes the value of `S1` from before the assignment
   - `S1` now takes the value of `S_next` from before the assignment, which is `2 * S1 + S0`

So, the updated values are:
- `S0` is now the original value of `S1`
- `S1` is now the original value of `S_next`, which is `2 * S1 + S0`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `i` is 2; `S0` is the original value of `S1`; `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`**
