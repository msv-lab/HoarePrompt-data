`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. However, the initial values of `S0` and `S1` are not provided. Since `S0` and `S1` are not specified in the initial state, they remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `S_next` is now defined as `2 * S1 + S0`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 2 * `S1` + `S0`**
