The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. Initially, `S0` is \(-\frac{6}{7} \times S0\), `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\), and `S_next` is \(-\frac{16}{7} \times S0\). After swapping, `S0` becomes \(-\frac{16}{7} \times S0\) and `S1` becomes \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\).

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `S0` is \(-\frac{16}{7} \times S0\); `S1` is \(-\frac{5}{7} \times S0\)**
