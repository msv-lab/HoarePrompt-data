The code `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` assigns the value of `2 * S1 + S0` to `S_next`. Given the initial state where `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`, the value of `S_next` becomes `2 * (2 * S1 + S0) + S0`. However, since `S1` is already defined as `2 * S1 + S0`, the value of `S1` does not change. 

So, the updated values are:
- `S_next` is `2 * (2 * S1 + S0) + S0` which simplifies to `4 * S1 + 2 * S0`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `S0`, and `S1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `S0` is the original value of `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S_next` is `4 * S1 + 2 * S0`**
