The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` will be 2. The values of `n`, `num`, and the condition related to `num` (that it is either 1 more or 5 less than a multiple of 6) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. The current value of `num` is either 1 more or 5 less than a multiple of 6.**
