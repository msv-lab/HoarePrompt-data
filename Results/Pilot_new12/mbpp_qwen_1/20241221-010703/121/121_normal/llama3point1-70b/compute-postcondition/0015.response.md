`num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 7, so after incrementing, `num` becomes 8. The conditions about `num` and `count` are still valid, meaning `num` is neither equal to `count + 1` (which is 3) nor `count - 5` (which is -3), and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. The current value of `num` is neither equal to `count + 1` nor `count - 5`, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. The current value of `num` is neither equal to `count + 1` nor `count - 5`, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
