`num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 9, so after executing `num += 1`, the new value of `num` is 10. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 10, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`**
