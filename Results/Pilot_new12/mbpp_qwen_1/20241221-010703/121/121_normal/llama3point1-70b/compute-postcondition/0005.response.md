The code assigns the value `7` to the variable `num`. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and the value of `count` is `1`. After executing the line `num = 7`, the values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
