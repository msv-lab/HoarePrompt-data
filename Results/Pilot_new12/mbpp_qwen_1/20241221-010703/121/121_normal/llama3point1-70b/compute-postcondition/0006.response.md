According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the loop continues to run. The loop body is omitted, but the condition for the loop to continue is not explicitly stated in the loop header itself. However, since it is a `while True` loop, it will always proceed to the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- `count` is 1.
- `num` is 7.

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustment is needed to any of the given states to allow the loop to execute the first iteration. The loop will proceed regardless of the current values of `n`, `count`, and `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
