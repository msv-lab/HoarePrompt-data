`count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `num`, and the condition `func_1(num)` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`**
