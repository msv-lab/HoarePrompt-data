Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns 9, which satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the condition `count != n` is met.***
