Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either 8 or satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num` which is 8. Otherwise, `count` is set to 3, `num` is 8, and `func_1(num)` remains satisfied.***
