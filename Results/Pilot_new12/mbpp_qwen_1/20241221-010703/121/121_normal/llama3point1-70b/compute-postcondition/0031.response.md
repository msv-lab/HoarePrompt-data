The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The function has multiple return conditions:
- Case_1: The function returns 7.
- Case_2: The function returns 7, which is either 1 more or 5 less than a multiple of 6, and the count remains 2.
- Case_3: The function returns `num` which is 8.
- Case_4: The function returns 9, which satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return one of the specified values based on certain conditions.
