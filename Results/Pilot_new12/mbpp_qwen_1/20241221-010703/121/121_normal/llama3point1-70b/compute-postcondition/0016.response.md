According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as there is no explicit `break` statement inside the loop body. Since the loop is unconditionally true, no specific conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any of the given states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. The current value of `num` is neither equal to `count + 1` nor `count - 5`, and `count` is not equal to `n`**
