Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. If `count` does not equal `n`, the postcondition remains that `count` is 3, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`***
