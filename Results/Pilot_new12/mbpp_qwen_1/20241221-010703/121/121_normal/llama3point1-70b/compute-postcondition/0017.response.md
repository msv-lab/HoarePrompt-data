`count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 2, so after incrementing, `count` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `num`, and the condition `func_1(num)` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 8, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`. The current value of `num` is neither equal to `count + 1` nor `count - 5`, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 8, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`**
