Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7, the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`***

This postcondition maintains the initial state of the variables as described in the precondition and includes the additional requirement from the if condition that `num` must satisfy the function `func_1`.
