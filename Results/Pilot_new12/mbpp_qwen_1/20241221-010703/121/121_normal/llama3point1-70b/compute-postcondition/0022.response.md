`num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 8, so after incrementing, `num` becomes 9. The other variables (`n`, `count`, and the condition related to `func_1(num)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`.**
