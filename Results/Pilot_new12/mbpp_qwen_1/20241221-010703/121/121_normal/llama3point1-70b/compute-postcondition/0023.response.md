According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop itself to control its termination, the only way to ensure the loop executes one more time is to ensure that the loop continues without any interruptions.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- `count` is 3.
- `num` is 9.
- The value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary to ensure the loop executes one more time because the loop will always continue unless interrupted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`**
