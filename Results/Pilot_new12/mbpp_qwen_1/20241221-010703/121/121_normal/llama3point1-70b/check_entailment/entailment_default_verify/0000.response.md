Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not follow the specific sequence defined by Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The provided output hints further clarify that the function `func_2` aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, starting from 7 and checking for primality along with specific congruence conditions. However, the implementation does not generate the sequence as per the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime criteria. 

The output hints mention that the function starts with 7 and increments `num` by 1, checking for primality and specific congruence conditions. While this approach seems to be an attempt to filter primes, it does not correctly generate the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes is defined by a more specific formula involving quadratic residues, which is not implemented in the given code.

Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate, and the program does not meet the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
