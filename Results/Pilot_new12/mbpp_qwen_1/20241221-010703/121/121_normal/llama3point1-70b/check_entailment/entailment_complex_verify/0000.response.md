Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence. While the function checks for primality and filters based on the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]`, it does not follow the specific formula or sequence defined for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The sequence starts with 7 and each subsequent prime is generated using a more complex formula involving quadratic residues modulo primes, which is not implemented in the given code. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
