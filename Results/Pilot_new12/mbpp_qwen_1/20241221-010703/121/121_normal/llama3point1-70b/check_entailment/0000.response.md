Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The function `func_2` attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it does not follow the specific sequence defined by these primes. The sequence starts with 7, and each subsequent prime is generated using a specific formula involving quadratic residues modulo primes. However, the current implementation only checks for general primality and filters based on congruence conditions which do not capture the exact sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

For instance, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 29, 47, 167, 2879, etc., whereas the given program might return a different sequence of primes. Therefore, this program does not meet the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for every potential case.
