Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the problem description, the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are derived from the recurrence relation \(P_{n} = P_{n-1}^2 - 2\), starting from the initial term \(P_1 = 7\). However, the provided code instead increments by 1 from the starting number 7 and checks if the resulting number is prime and satisfies the condition \(num \% 6 \in [1, 5]\).

This approach does not generate the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, but rather a sequence of numbers that satisfy the prime condition and the modulo condition. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, making the code incorrect.
