Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code for `func_2` does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence. The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are defined as follows: the first prime is 7, and each subsequent prime is the smallest prime greater than the previous one such that the difference between consecutive primes is also a prime number. The current implementation only checks if the number is prime and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which does not necessarily satisfy the Newman-Shanks-Williams condition.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 13, 19, 37, 43, 67, etc. The number 13 is the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime because it is the next prime after 7 and the difference (13 - 7 = 6) is not a prime. However, the code would incorrectly include 13 as a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime because it satisfies the modulo condition.

To fix this, the code needs to check the difference between the current number and the previous prime in the sequence to ensure it is also a prime.
