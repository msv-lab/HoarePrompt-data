Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks whether a given number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.
   - This function is used as a helper function to check primality of numbers.

2. **Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime Finder (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` starts by checking if `n` is 1. If so, it returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function initializes `count` to 1 and `num` to 7. It then enters a loop that increments `num` by 1 each time until it finds a number that satisfies two conditions:
     - The number must pass the primality test using `func_1`.
     - The number must be congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6 (i.e., `num % 6` is either 1 or 5).
   - Once a valid number is found, the function returns it.

3. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop continues until a valid prime number is found and returned. Since the function ensures that each `num` is checked for primality and meets the modular condition, the loop will eventually terminate and return the correct result.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
