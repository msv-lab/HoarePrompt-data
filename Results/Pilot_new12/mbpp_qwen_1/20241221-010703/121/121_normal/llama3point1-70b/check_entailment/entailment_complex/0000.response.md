Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the problem description asks to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic for finding these primes.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are defined as primes of the form \( p = 6k \pm 1 \). The code attempts to check this condition (`if num % 6 in [1, 5]`), but it does not correctly generate the sequence of numbers to check. The code starts from 7 and increments by 1, which does not ensure that only numbers of the form \( 6k \pm 1 \) are checked.

To correctly find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, the function should start from 5 (the smallest Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increment by 6, checking only numbers of the form \( 6k - 1 \) and \( 6k + 1 \). The current implementation will miss many potential Newman-Shanks-Williams primes and may include non-prime numbers.

For example, if `n` is 2, the function should return 11 (the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime), but it might return 13 or another incorrect number because it does not correctly generate the sequence of potential primes.

Therefore, the code is not correct according to the problem description.
