You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic for generating Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Specifically, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is used to check if a number is of the form \(6k \pm 1\), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for primality. Additionally, the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes is defined by a specific recurrence relation, and the current implementation does not adhere to this definition.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 29, 71, 73, 109, 149, 221 (which is not prime), 229, 313, 331, 431, etc. The current implementation does not generate these numbers correctly. For instance, when `n=2`, the program should return 29, but it returns 29 only if the loop happens to land on 29, which is not guaranteed. Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Here’s the detailed breakdown of its behavior:

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function starts with `count` set to 1 and `num` initialized to 7. It then enters a loop where it checks if `func_1(num)` is true and if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. If both conditions are met, it increments `count` and checks if `count` equals `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`.

The function aims to find the `n`-th number in the sequence that meets the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime criteria, starting from 7 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until the correct number is found.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7 directly.
- If no suitable `num` is found that meets the conditions within the loop (which should not happen given the problem statement), the function will continue indefinitely. However, since the problem specifies that the function will eventually return a valid result, this edge case is not practically relevant.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
