Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides insights into how the functions operate, but it does not change the fundamental issue with the implementation of `func_2`. 

- `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime.
- `func_2` initializes the search for the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number starting from 7 and increments `num` until it finds a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. However, this approach does not generate the specific sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are generated using a more complex formula involving quadratic residues modulo primes. The current implementation only checks for general primality and filters based on simple congruence conditions, which is insufficient to generate the correct sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 29, 47, 167, 2879, etc., and the provided code might return a different sequence of primes.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, and the original assessment remains correct.
