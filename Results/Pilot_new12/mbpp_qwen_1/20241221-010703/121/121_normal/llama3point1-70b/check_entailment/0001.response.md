Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic for generating Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Specifically, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]` is used to check if a number is of the form \(6k \pm 1\), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for primality. Additionally, the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes is defined by a specific recurrence relation, and the current implementation does not adhere to this definition.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 29, 71, 73, 109, 149, 221 (which is not prime), 229, 313, 331, 431, etc. The current implementation does not generate these numbers correctly. For instance, when `n=2`, the program should return 29, but it returns 29 only if the loop happens to land on 29, which is not guaranteed. Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
