    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is `n + 1`, `num` is `count`, and the value of `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Here’s the detailed breakdown of its behavior:

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function starts with `count` set to 1 and `num` initialized to 7. It then enters a loop where it checks if `func_1(num)` is true and if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. If both conditions are met, it increments `count` and checks if `count` equals `n`. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`.

The function aims to find the `n`-th number in the sequence that meets the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime criteria, starting from 7 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until the correct number is found.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7 directly.
- If no suitable `num` is found that meets the conditions within the loop (which should not happen given the problem statement), the function will continue indefinitely. However, since the problem specifies that the function will eventually return a valid result, this edge case is not practically relevant.
