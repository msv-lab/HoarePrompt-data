The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It returns two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements of `lst` starting from the `L`th element. This is achieved using list slicing. If `L` is 0, the first sublist will be an empty list, and the second sublist will contain all elements of `lst`. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first sublist will contain all elements, and the second sublist will be an empty list. The original list `lst` remains unchanged.
