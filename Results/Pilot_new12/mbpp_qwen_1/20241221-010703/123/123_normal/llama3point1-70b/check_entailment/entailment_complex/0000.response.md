Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs and returns a tuple containing two sublists:

1. The first sublist consists of the first `L` elements of `lst` (using `lst[:L]`).
2. The second sublist consists of the remaining elements of `lst` starting from the `L`th element (using `lst[L:]`).

This implementation satisfies the requirements for all possible values of `L` within the specified range (i.e., `0 <= L <= len(lst)`). 

- When `L = 0`, the first sublist is empty (`[]`), and the second sublist contains all elements of `lst`.
- When `L = len(lst)`, the first sublist contains all elements of `lst`, and the second sublist is empty (`[]`).
- For any other value of `L`, the function correctly splits `lst` into two parts as required.

Since the program adheres to the problem description for all valid cases, the correctness is **True**.
