Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts as specified, where the first part contains the first `L` elements, and the second part contains the remaining elements starting from the `L`th element. The annotations provided align with this behavior and correctly describe the operation of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
