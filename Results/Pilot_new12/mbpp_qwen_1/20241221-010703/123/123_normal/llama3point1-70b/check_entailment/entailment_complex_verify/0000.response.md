Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns them as a tuple. The annotations clearly describe the behavior of the function, stating that it returns two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements starting from the `L`th element. 

The function handles edge cases appropriately:
- When `L` is 0, the first sublist is an empty list, and the second sublist contains all elements of `lst`.
- When `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first sublist contains all elements, and the second sublist is an empty list.
- When `L` is within the bounds of the list length, the function correctly returns the first part up to index `L` and the rest of the list from index `L`.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct, and there is no need to change it. Therefore, the final assessment is True.
