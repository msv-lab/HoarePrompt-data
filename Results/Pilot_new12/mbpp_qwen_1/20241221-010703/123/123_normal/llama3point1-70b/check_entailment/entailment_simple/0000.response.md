Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it splits the list into two parts:

1. The first part contains the first `L` elements of the list (`lst[:L]`).
2. The second part contains the remaining elements starting from the `L`th element (`lst[L:]`).

The function then returns these two parts as a tuple. Given the constraints \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\), the slicing operations will always produce valid sublists. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs.
