Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in all cases:

- When `L` is within the bounds of the list length, the function correctly returns the first part up to index `L` and the rest of the list from index `L`.
- When `L` is 0, the function returns an empty list for the first part and the entire original list for the second part.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function returns the entire list for the first part and an empty list for the second part.
- When `L` is negative or exceeds the list length, Python slicing handles this by returning the appropriate portions of the list.

The provided output hints also support this behavior, confirming that the function performs the required operation correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
