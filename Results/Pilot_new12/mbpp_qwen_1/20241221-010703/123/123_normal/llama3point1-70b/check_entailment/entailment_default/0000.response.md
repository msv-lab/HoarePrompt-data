Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. For any given list `lst` and integer `L`, the function `func_1` returns a tuple containing two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements starting from the `L`th element. The code handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of `lst`, returning appropriate sublists. The function also assumes that the input is valid, which aligns with the assumption made in the problem description. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case as described.
