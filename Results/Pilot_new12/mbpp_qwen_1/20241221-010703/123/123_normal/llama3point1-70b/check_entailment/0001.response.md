Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements of the list. This satisfies the problem description for any valid inputs where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. Since the function handles all potential cases as described, it is correct.
