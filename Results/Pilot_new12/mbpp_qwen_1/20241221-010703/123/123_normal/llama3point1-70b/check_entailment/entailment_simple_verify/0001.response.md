Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version clarifies that before the function call, `lst` is guaranteed to be a list and `L` is an integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which means the function will always produce valid sublists without causing any errors. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
