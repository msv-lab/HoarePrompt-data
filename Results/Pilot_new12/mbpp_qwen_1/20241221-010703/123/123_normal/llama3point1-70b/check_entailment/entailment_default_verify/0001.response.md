Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements of the list. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns two sublists: the first containing the first `L` elements and the second containing the remaining elements starting from the `L`th element. The function handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
