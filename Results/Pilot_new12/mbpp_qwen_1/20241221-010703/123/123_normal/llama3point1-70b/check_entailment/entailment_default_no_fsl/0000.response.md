Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts based on the integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The function handles all edge cases as described:
- When `L` is 0, the first sublist is empty, and the second sublist contains all elements of the list.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first sublist contains all elements, and the second sublist is empty.
- For any other value of `L`, the function correctly splits the list into two parts as required.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described in the problem and output hints, the correctness is **True**.
