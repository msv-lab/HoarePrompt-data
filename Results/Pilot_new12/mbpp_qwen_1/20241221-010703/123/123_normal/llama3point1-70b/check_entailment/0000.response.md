Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns them as a tuple. This works for all potential cases:

- When `L` is within the bounds of the list length, the function correctly returns the first part up to index `L` and the rest of the list from index `L`.
- When `L` is 0, the function returns an empty list for the first part and the entire original list for the second part.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function returns the entire list for the first part and an empty list for the second part.
- When `L` is negative or exceeds the list length, Python slicing handles this by returning the appropriate portions of the list.

Since the function behaves as expected in all cases, the correctness is **True**.
