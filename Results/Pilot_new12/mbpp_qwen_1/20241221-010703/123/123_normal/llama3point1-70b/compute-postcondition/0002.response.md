Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It returns two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements of `lst` starting from the `L`th element. This is achieved using list slicing. If `L` is 0, the first sublist will be an empty list, and the second sublist will contain all elements of `lst`. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first sublist will contain all elements, and the second sublist will be an empty list. The original list `lst` remains unchanged.**

Edge cases:
- If `L` is 0, the function returns `[], lst`.
- If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns `lst, []`.
- If `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still return `lst[:L], lst[L:]`, but `lst[:L]` will be equal to `lst` and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list. However, since the function does not check for `L > len(lst)`, this could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the caller relies on the second sublist being non-empty.
