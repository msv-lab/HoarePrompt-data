The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function returns two sublists: `lst[:L]`, which contains the first L elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]`, which contains the remaining elements of `lst` starting from the Lth element.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns two sublists: the first sublist contains the first L elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements of `lst` starting from the Lth element.**
