The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It returns two slices of the list: the first slice contains elements from the start of the list up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice contains elements from index `L` to the end of the list. If `L` is 0, the first slice is empty and the second slice is the entire list. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first slice is the entire list and the second slice is empty. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, only the first slice is returned, which is the entire list, and the second slice is not returned.
