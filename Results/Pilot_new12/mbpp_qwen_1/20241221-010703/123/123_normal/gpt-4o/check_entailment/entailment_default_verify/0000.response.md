Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the first slice up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice starting from index `L` to the end of the list. The examples provided in the problem description also match this behavior, and there are no contradictions or issues identified in the provided code or output hints that would suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
