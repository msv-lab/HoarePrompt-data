Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs and splits the list into two parts. The first part contains the elements from the beginning of the list up to but not including index `L`, and the second part contains the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. The function then returns these two parts as a tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid inputs, i.e., `lst` is a list and `L` is an integer within the range `[0, len(lst)]`. Since the function does not explicitly check these conditions, it is considered correct under this assumption.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to split the list into two parts as required. Specifically:
   - `lst[:L]` creates a new list containing elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including index `L`.
   - `lst[L:]` creates a new list containing elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing these two slices, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality, and therefore the program is correct according to the problem description.
