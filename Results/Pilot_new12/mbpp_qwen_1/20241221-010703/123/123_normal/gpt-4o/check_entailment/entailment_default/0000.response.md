Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts based on the integer `L` and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The program handles various cases, including when `L` is 0, when `L` is equal to the length of the list, and when `L` is greater than the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for these cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
