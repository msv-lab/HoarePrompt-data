Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and the rest forms the second part. The annotations further clarify that the function returns two slices of the list: the first slice from the start up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice from index `L` to the end. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
