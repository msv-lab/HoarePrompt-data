Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returns the resulting lists in a tuple, as described. The annotated version clarifies that the function behaves as expected, returning the appropriate slices of the list based on the value of `L`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
