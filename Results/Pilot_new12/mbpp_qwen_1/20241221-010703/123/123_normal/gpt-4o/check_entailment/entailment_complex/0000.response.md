Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. Given a list `lst` and an integer `L`, it splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. The function returns these two parts as a tuple.

- The function uses list slicing with `lst[:L]` to get the first part of the list, which includes elements from the start up to but not including index `L`.
- The function uses `lst[L:]` to get the second part of the list, which includes elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list.

This approach ensures that for all valid inputs, the function behaves as expected:
- When `L` is 0, the first part is empty, and the second part is the entire list.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part is the entire list, and the second part is empty.
- For any other value of `L`, the function correctly splits the list into two parts as specified.

Since the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all valid cases, the program is correct.
