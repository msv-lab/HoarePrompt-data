Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and returns them in a tuple. The function uses list slicing to achieve this, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. Based on the provided test cases and the general logic of the function, it appears that the function works as expected for the given problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the examples and the logic implemented.
