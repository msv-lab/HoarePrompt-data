Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of splitting a list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The provided output hints align with the function's implementation and the problem description. The function handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list, and it behaves as expected for other values of `L`. The test cases also confirm that the function works correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
