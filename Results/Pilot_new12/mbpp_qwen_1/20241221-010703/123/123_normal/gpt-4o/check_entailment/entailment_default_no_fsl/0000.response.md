Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. The code handles all the described cases:

- When `L` is 0, the first slice is empty, and the second slice contains the entire list.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first slice contains the entire list, and the second slice is empty.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first slice contains the entire list, and the second slice is not returned.

The provided test cases also confirm that the code works correctly for these scenarios. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
