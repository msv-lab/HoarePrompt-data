The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). The function returns two slices of the list `lst`: `lst[:L]`, which includes elements from the start of the list up to but not including index `L`, and `lst[L:]`, which includes elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns `lst[:L]` (elements from the start up to but not including index `L`) and `lst[L:]` (elements from index `L` to the end of the list).**
