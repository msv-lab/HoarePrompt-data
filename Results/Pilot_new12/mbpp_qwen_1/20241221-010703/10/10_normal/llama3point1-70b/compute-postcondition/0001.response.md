The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. Here, `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. All parameters are non-negative real numbers.

The function calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\) and returns the result.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the base length `b`, height `h`, and length `l` of a triangular prism and return the volume of the prism calculated using the given formula.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, where `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. It returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula `(b * h / 2) * l`.**
