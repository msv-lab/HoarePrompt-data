Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism given the base length `b`, height `h` of the triangular base, and the length `l` of the prism. The volume is computed using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). The function accepts three non-negative real number parameters and returns a single non-negative real number representing the volume of the prism. No edge cases or missing functionalities are present; the code directly implements the formula provided in the comments.**

This summary focuses on the final state of the program after it concludes, based on the actual code rather than the annotations. The annotations were mostly accurate, and no additional edge cases or missing functionality were identified.
