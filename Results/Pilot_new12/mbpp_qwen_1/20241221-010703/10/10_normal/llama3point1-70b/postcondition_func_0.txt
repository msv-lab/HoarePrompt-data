The function `func_1` calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism given the base length `b`, height `h` of the triangular base, and the length `l` of the prism. The volume is computed using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). The function accepts three non-negative real number parameters and returns a single non-negative real number representing the volume of the prism. No edge cases or missing functionalities are present; the code directly implements the formula provided in the comments.
