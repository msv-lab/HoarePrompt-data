Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \((b * h / 2) * l\), where `b` is the base length, `h` is the height of the triangular base, and `l` is the length of the prism. The function accepts three non-negative real number parameters and returns a single non-negative real number representing the volume of the prism. Since no edge cases or missing functionalities are mentioned in the output hints, and the function directly implements the formula provided, the program appears to meet the requirements for every potential case within the constraints given.
