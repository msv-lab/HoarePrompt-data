Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by \((b * h / 2) * l\), where `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. The function accepts three non-negative real number parameters and returns a single non-negative real number representing the volume of the prism. Since the program directly implements the formula and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential valid inputs.
