Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The annotated version confirms that `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. The function returns `(b * h / 2) * l`, which is consistent with the formula. Since the problem description specifies that the inputs are non-negative real numbers and the function correctly applies the formula, the program is correct according to the given specifications.
