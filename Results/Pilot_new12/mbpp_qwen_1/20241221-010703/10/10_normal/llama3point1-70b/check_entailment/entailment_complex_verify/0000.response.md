Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\), which is the correct formula for the volume of a triangular prism. The function accepts three non-negative real number parameters, and the annotations confirm that the function correctly implements the formula without any edge cases or missing functionalities. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of its correctness is valid.
