Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The formula used is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is the standard formula for the volume of a triangular prism. Since the function follows the formula correctly and there are no edge cases or additional conditions specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
