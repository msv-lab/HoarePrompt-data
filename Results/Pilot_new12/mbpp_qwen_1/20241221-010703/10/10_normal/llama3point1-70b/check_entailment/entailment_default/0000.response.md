Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \((\text{base} \times \text{height} / 2) \times \text{length}\). Given the problem description and the output hints, the function takes three non-negative real number parameters (base length `b`, height `h` of the triangular base, and the length `l` of the prism) and returns a single non-negative real number representing the volume of the prism. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities present in the code. The function directly implements the formula provided in the problem description, and the output hints confirm this. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case as described.
