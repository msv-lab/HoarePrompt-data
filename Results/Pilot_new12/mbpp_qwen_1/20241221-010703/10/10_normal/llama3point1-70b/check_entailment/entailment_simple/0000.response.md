Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

In the annotated program, the function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left( \frac{b \times h}{2} \right) \times l \]

Where:
- \( b \) is the base length of the triangle,
- \( h \) is the height of the triangle,
- \( l \) is the length of the prism.

The function directly implements this formula and returns the calculated volume. Since the problem description requires a function to find the volume of a triangular prism using these parameters, and the provided function does exactly that, the program is correct.
