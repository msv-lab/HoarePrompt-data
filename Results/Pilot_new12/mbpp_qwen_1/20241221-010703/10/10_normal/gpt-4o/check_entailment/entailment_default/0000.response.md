Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by \( \text{volume} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, and computes the volume using the formula. The test cases provided in the assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. The output hints also agree with the code and the problem description, indicating that the function returns the computed volume for valid inputs. There are no examples or hints suggesting that the function does not work correctly for any potential case, assuming valid and non-negative inputs.
