Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation for the volume of a triangular prism according to the given problem description. The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which represent the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. It calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \) and then computes the volume of the prism by multiplying this area by the length. The function returns the computed volume, adhering to the specified formula. The test cases provided also validate the correctness of the function for different sets of inputs, ensuring that the implementation is accurate for the intended purpose. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
