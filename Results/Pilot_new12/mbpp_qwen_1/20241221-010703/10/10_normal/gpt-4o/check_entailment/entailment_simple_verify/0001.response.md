Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the appropriate formula. The annotated version confirms that the inputs (base, height, and length) are non-negative numbers, which aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases. Since the function passes all the given assertions and the annotations validate the correctness of the inputs and the computation process, the original assessment remains accurate.
