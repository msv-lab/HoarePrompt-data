Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The given test cases:
- `func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240`
- `func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6`
- `func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1`

all pass and match the expected results. There are no apparent issues with the logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
