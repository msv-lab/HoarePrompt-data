Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports this assessment by confirming that the function `func_1` takes three non-negative numbers (base, height, and length) as inputs and correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The provided assertions also match the expected outputs, further validating the correctness of the function. The annotations indicate that the function handles valid inputs appropriately, and there are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned that could cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
