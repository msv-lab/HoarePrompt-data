Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism accurately based on the provided assertions. The output hints confirm that the function handles non-negative values for `base`, `height`, and `length`. Although the hints note that the function will still compute volumes for negative inputs, this behavior is not necessarily incorrect as long as the problem description does not explicitly state that only non-negative values should be accepted. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the input values being non-negative, the current implementation is considered correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
