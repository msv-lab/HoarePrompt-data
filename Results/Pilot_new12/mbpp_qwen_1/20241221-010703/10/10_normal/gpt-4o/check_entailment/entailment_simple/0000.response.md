Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]

The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which represent the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. These parameters are used in the formula to compute the volume. The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function works as expected for different sets of input values. Since the function always follows the formula and the assertions pass for the given test cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
