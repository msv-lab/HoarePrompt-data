Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \( \text{volume} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The test cases provided (`func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240`, `func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6`, and `func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1`) all match the expected results based on the formula. Additionally, the code handles non-negative values for the base, height, and length parameters as required by the problem description. There are no indications in the problem description or the output hints of any edge cases or scenarios where the code would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
