Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The assertions given in the test cases match the expected outputs, and the logic implemented in the function is sound. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
