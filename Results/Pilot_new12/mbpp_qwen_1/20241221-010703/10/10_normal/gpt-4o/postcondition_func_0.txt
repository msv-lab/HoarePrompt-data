The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, which represent the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \( \text{volume} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The function returns the computed volume. The function handles non-negative values for `base`, `height`, and `length`. If any of these parameters are negative, the function will still compute the volume using those values, which may not be physically meaningful for a triangular prism.
