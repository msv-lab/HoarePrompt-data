The code calculates the area of the base of the triangular prism using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). This value is stored in the variable `base_area`. The values of `base`, `height`, and `length` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `base_area` and the unchanged values of `base`, `height`, and `length`.

Output State: **`base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`, `base` is non-negative, `height` is non-negative, `length` is non-negative**
