The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These parameters are non-negative numbers representing the base, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns the value calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three non-negative numbers `base`, `height`, and `length`, and return the volume of a triangular prism using the formula 0.5 * base * height * length.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the volume of a triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
