The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the XOR of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `xor_result`. The function then checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. A number is considered a power of 2 if it is not zero and the bitwise AND of `xor_result` and `xor_result - 1` equals zero. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is zero, or both are zero, in which case `xor_result` will also be zero, leading to a return value of `False`. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code; however, the function only evaluates the XOR result and its power-of-2 property, without performing any additional operations or returning other values.
