Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotations support this by explaining each step of the process:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`.
2. `xor_result != 0` ensures that the numbers are different.
3. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set, which means it is a power of 2 minus 1.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios and confirm the function's correctness. The annotations clarify the steps and potential edge cases, such as when `xor_result` is zero, which leads to a return value of `False`. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
