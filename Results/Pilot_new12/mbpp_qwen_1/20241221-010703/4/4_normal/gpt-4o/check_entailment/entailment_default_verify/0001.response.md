Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the bitwise XOR operation and then checking if the result is a power of 2. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases like when both numbers are zero, ensuring that the function behaves as expected. The output hints confirm that the function logically checks for the condition specified in the problem description, and there are no issues or missing functionalities noted. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
