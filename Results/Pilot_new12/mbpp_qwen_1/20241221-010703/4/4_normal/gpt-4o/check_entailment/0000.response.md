Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic uses the XOR operation to find differing bits and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set. This is achieved by using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`, which is true only if `xor_result` is a power of two (i.e., has exactly one bit set). The additional condition `xor_result != 0` ensures that the numbers are not equal. All the provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
