Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used in the function is correct:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`.
2. `xor_result != 0` ensures that the numbers are different.
3. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set (i.e., it is a power of 2 minus 1).

This logic works for all the provided test cases and will correctly identify if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Since no counterexample has been found where the function fails, the program is correct.
