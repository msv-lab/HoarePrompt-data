Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation to find differing bits and then checking if the result has exactly one bit set. The condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` ensures that the XOR result is a power of two, meaning it has exactly one bit set. Additionally, the condition `xor_result != 0` ensures that the numbers are not equal. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
