Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function computes the XOR of the two numbers, and then checks if the result is a power of 2. This is a valid method to determine if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, as the XOR operation will result in a number with exactly one bit set to 1 if and only if the two input numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function handles all provided test cases correctly and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the code. Therefore, the program follows the problem description for every potential case.
