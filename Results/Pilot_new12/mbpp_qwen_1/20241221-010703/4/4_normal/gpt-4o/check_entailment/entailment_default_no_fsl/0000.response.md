Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function `func_1` calculates the XOR of the two numbers and then checks if the result is a power of 2. This is done using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`, which is true if and only if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (excluding zero). The assertions provided cover various cases, including when the numbers differ at exactly one bit, and when they do not. The code handles these cases correctly, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the problem description.
