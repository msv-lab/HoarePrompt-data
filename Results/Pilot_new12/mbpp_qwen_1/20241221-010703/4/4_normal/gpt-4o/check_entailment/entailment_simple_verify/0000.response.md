Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotation correctly describes the state and behavior of the program:

1. The function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b`.
2. It calculates the XOR result of `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if the XOR result is a power of 2, which means there is exactly one bit difference between `a` and `b`.

All the provided test cases in the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
