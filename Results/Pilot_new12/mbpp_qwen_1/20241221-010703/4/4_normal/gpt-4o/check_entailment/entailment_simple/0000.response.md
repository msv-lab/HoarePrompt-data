Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The problem description asks for a function that checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic.

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **XOR Operation**: 
   - The XOR operation (`^`) between two numbers will result in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different, and 0 if they are the same.
   - For example, if `a = 13` (binary `1101`) and `b = 9` (binary `1001`), the result of `a ^ b` is `4` (binary `0100`).

2. **Power of Two Check**:
   - The function then checks if the XOR result (`xor_result`) is a power of 2.
   - A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1. This can be checked using the condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`.
   - If `xor_result` is a power of 2, the result of `xor_result & (xor_result - 1)` will be 0. Otherwise, it will not be 0.

Let's verify the assertions provided with this logic:

- `assert func_1(13, 9) == True`: 
  - `13 ^ 9 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2 (binary `0100`), so it returns `True`.

- `assert func_1(15, 8) == False`: 
  - `15 ^ 8 = 7`, and 7 is not a power of 2 (binary `0111`), so it returns `False`.

- `assert func_1(2, 4) == False`: 
  - `2 ^ 4 = 6`, and 6 is not a power of 2 (binary `0110`), so it returns `False`.

- `assert func_1(2, 3) == True`: 
  - `2 ^ 3 = 1`, and 1 is a power of 2 (binary `0001`), so it returns `True`.

- `assert func_1(5, 1) == True`: 
  - `5 ^ 1 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2 (binary `0100`), so it returns `True`.

- `assert func_1(1, 5) == True`: 
  - `1 ^ 5 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2 (binary `0100`), so it returns `True`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic of checking if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the program is correct according to the problem description.
