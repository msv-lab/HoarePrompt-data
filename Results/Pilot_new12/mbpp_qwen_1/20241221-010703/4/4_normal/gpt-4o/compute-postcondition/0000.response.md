`xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`. The caret (^) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, and `xor_result` is the result of `a ^ b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `xor_result` is the result of `a ^ b`**
