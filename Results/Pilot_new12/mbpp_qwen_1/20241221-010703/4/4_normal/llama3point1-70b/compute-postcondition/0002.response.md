Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to its binary representation, counts the number of '1's in this binary string, and returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers) and correctly evaluates the XOR result for all such inputs.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either `num1` or `num2` is 0, the function still correctly evaluates the XOR operation and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result.
- If both `num1` and `num2` are the same, the result of the XOR operation will be 0, which has no '1's, so the function returns `False`.
- If the result of the XOR operation has exactly one '1' in its binary representation, the function returns `True`.
- If the result of the XOR operation has more than one '1' in its binary representation, the function returns `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations and the code correctly describe the behavior of the function, and there are no apparent missing functionalities.
