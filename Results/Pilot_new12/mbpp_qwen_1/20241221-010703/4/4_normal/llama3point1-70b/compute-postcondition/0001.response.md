The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are non-negative integers. The function returns `True` if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `(num1 XOR num2)` is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, perform a bitwise XOR operation on them, count the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result, and return `True` if this count is exactly 1, otherwise return `False`.
