The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to its binary representation, counts the number of '1's in this binary string, and returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers) and correctly evaluates the XOR result for all such inputs.
