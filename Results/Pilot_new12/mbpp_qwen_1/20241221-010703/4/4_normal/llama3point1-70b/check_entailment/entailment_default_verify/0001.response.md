Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles all valid inputs (non-negative integers) and correctly evaluates the XOR result for all such inputs. The logic of performing a bitwise XOR operation, converting the result to binary, counting the number of '1's, and returning `True` if the count is exactly 1 aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, no changes are needed to the original assessment.
