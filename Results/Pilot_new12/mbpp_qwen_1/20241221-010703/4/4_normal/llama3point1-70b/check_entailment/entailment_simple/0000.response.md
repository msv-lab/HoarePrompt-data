Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position when XORed together.
2. **Implementation**: The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` as inputs. It computes the XOR of these two numbers using the `^` operator, converts the result to its binary representation using `bin()`, and counts the number of '1's in this binary string using `.count('1')`.

3. **Condition Check**: The function returns `True` if the count of '1's is exactly 1, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the nature of the XOR operation, if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, their XOR result will have exactly one '1' in its binary representation. Conversely, if they differ at more than one bit position, the XOR result will have multiple '1's, and if they are identical, the XOR result will be 0 (which has no '1's).

Therefore, the provided implementation accurately checks whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by verifying if the number of '1's in the binary representation of their XOR is exactly 1.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
