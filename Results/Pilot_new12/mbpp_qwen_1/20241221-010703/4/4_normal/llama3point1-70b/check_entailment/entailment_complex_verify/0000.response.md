Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs a bitwise XOR operation, converts the result to its binary representation, and counts the number of '1's. If the count is exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotations confirm that the function correctly implements this logic and handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers). Since the problem description asks for a function that checks if two numbers differ at one bit position only, and the provided code satisfies this requirement, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
