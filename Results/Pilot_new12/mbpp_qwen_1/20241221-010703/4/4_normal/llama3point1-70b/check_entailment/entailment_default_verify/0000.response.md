Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The output hints confirm that the function handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers) and evaluates the XOR result correctly. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
