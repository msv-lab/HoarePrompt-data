Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation (`^`). The binary representation of the result of `num1 ^ num2` will have '1's at positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. Counting the number of '1's in this binary string using `.count('1')` will give the number of differing bit positions. The function returns `True` if and only if there is exactly one '1', which means the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This logic correctly implements the requirement for all potential cases, as confirmed by the annotated version of the code.
