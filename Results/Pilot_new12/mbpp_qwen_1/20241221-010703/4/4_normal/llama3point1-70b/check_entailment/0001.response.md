Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the XOR operation (`^`) to compare two numbers. The binary representation of the result of `num1 ^ num2` will have '1's at positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. Counting the number of '1's in this binary string using `.count('1')` will give the number of differing bit positions. The function returns `True` if and only if there is exactly one '1', which means the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This logic correctly implements the requirement for all potential cases.
