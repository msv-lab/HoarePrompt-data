Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation to find differing bits and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This logic covers all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios, such as zero, negative numbers, and large numbers. Therefore, the function works correctly according to the problem description for all tested cases.
