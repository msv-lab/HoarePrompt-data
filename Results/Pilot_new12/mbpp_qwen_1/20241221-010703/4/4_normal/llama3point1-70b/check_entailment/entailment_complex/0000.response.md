Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function checks whether two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. Here's how it works:

1. The function performs a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) on `num1` and `num2`.
2. The result of the XOR operation is converted to its binary representation using `bin()`.
3. The binary string is then checked for the number of '1's using `.count('1')`.
4. The function returns `True` if there is exactly one '1' in the binary string, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the function meets all the requirements. It handles valid inputs (non-negative integers) and correctly evaluates the XOR result for all such inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
