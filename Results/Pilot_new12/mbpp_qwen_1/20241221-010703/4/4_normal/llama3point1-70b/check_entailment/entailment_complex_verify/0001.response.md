Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position. The function performs a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs, converts the result to its binary representation, and counts the number of '1's. It returns `True` if there is exactly one '1' (indicating the numbers differ at exactly one bit position), and `False` otherwise. The annotated version aligns with this logic and confirms that the function handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers) correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
