Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program and the logic being used. The function `func_1` uses the XOR operation to identify differing bits between `num1` and `num2`. Then, it counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This approach covers all potential cases, including non-negative integers, and aligns with the problem description. The annotations support the correctness of the function, confirming that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
