Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. It does this by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers, converting the result to its binary representation, and counting the number of '1's in this binary string. The function returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, indicating that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position, and `False` otherwise. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to handle all valid inputs correctly and meets the requirements for every potential case.
