You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation to find differing bits and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This logic covers all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios, such as zero, negative numbers, and large numbers. Therefore, the function works correctly according to the problem description for all tested cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are non-negative integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the number of '1's in the binary representation of (num1 XOR num2) is exactly 1, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to its binary representation, counts the number of '1's in this binary string, and returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers) and correctly evaluates the XOR result for all such inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
