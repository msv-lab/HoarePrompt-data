Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs a bitwise XOR operation on them, converts the result to its binary representation, counts the number of '1's in this binary string, and returns `True` if the count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. This approach correctly checks whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended for all valid inputs within the specified domain (non-negative integers). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
