#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists (where each element is itself a list).
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list where each element is the first item from the corresponding sublist in the original list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from the corresponding sublist in `lst`. If a sublist is empty, the function will include `None` for that position in the returned list. This is because the list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` will attempt to access `sublist[0]`, and if `sublist` is empty, it will result in `None`. The function does not modify the original list `lst`; it only processes and returns a derived list based on the input.
