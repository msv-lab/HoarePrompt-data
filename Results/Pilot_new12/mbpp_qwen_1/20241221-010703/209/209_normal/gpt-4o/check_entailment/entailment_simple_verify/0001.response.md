Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The annotations provided further confirm this behavior:

1. Before the function call, `lst` is a list of lists.
2. The function iterates over each sublist in `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness:
- `assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]`
- `assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]`
- `assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]`

Since the function behaves as intended and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
