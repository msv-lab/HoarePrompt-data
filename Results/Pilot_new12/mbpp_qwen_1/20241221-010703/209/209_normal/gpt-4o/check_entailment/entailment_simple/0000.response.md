Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to get the first element of each sublist within a list of lists. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist. This matches the problem description perfectly, as it states "Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist."

The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, assuming valid input. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the first item of the respective sublist in the original list `lst`. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the program always meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
