Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list of lists. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and retrieves the first element (`sublist[0]`). If a sublist is empty, the list comprehension will simply return `None` for that position in the resulting list. This behavior matches the problem description and the output hints provided. There are no cases mentioned in the hints or implied by the problem description where the function would fail to meet the requirements.
