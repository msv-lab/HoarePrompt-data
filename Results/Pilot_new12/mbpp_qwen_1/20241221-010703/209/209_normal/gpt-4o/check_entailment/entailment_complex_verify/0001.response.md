Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The annotations provided further clarify that the function processes and returns a derived list based on the input, and if a sublist is empty, it will include `None` for that position in the returned list. However, since the problem description does not mention handling empty sublists specifically, and the function correctly processes non-empty sublists as required, the function is correct according to the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
