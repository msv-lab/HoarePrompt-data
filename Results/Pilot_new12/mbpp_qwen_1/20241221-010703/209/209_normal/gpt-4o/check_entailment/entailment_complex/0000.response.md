Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists (`lst`) as input and return a new list containing the first element from each sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` correctly extracts the first element from each non-empty sublist, and if a sublist is empty, it results in `None` being included in the output list, which aligns with the problem description's assumption that we should handle empty sublists appropriately by returning `None`.

Given the assertions:
- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`

These results are consistent with the problem description, and the function behaves as expected for all provided cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
