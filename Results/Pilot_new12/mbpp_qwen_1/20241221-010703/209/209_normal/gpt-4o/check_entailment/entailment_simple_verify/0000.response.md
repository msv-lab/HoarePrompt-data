Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This matches the problem description perfectly for all given examples and potential cases. Since the function handles sublists of varying lengths and returns the expected results, it is correct. The annotations support this reasoning, indicating that the function behaves as intended, and there are no contradictions or issues found based on the provided information.
