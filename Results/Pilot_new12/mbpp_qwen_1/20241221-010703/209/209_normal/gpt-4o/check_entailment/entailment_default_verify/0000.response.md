Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` extracts the first element from each sublist. The provided code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The output hints confirm that if a sublist is empty, the function includes `None` for that position in the returned list. However, this behavior does not contradict the problem description, which only requires extracting the first element of each sublist without any specific handling for empty sublists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
