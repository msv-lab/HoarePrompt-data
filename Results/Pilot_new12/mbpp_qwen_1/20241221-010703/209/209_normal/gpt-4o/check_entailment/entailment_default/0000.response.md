Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by returning the first element of each sublist in the input list. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` ensures that for each sublist in `lst`, the first element is extracted and included in the resulting list. The function handles cases where sublists are empty by including `None` for those positions, as indicated in the output hints. Given the provided assertions and the description of the function's behavior, the function works correctly for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
