Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The output hints clarify that if a sublist is empty, the function will include `None` for that position in the returned list. However, this behavior aligns with the problem description, which does not specify how to handle empty sublists. Since the function works as expected in the provided test cases and the problem description does not impose additional constraints, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
