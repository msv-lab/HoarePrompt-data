Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. There is no mention of handling empty sublists differently, and the provided examples and the function's implementation confirm that it works as intended. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct remains valid.
