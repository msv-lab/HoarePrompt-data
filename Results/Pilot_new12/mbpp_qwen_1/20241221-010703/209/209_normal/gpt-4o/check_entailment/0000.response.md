Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This matches the problem description perfectly for all given examples and potential cases. Since the function handles sublists of varying lengths and returns the expected results, it is correct.
