Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. Based on the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]`
2. `assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]`
3. `assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]`

The function works as expected in all these cases. Additionally, since the function handles sublists of varying lengths and always returns the first element, it should work correctly for any valid input following the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
