Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from the corresponding sublist in `lst`. If a sublist is empty, the function will include `None` for that position in the returned list. This is because the list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` will attempt to access `sublist[0]`, and if `sublist` is empty, it will result in `None`. The function does not modify the original list `lst`; it only processes and returns a derived list based on the input.**

This summary includes the actual behavior of the code, noting the handling of empty sublists and the fact that the function does not modify the original list.
