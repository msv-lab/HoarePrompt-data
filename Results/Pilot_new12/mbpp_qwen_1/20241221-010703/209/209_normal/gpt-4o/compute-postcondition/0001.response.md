The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of lists (where each element is itself a list). The function returns a list where each element is the first item from the corresponding sublist in the original list `lst`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return a list containing the first item from each sublist in `lst`.
