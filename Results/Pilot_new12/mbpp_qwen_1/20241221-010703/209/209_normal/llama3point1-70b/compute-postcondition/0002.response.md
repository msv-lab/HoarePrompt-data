Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of sublists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original `sublists` list. This is achieved using a list comprehension. Potential edge cases include situations where one or more sublists within `sublists` are empty. In such cases, the corresponding element in the returned list will be an empty string, as `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError` if `sublists` contains an empty sublist. To handle this, the function should check for empty sublists and return a default value, such as `None` or an empty string, instead of raising an error.**

Given the current code, the function does not explicitly handle empty sublists, so the returned list may contain empty strings where sublists are empty. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is a list where each element is the first item from each non-empty sublist in the original `sublists` list, and an empty string from any empty sublists.
