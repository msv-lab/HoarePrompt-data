The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of sublists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original `sublists` list. This is achieved using a list comprehension. Potential edge cases include situations where one or more sublists within `sublists` are empty. In such cases, the corresponding element in the returned list will be an empty string, as `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError` if `sublists` contains an empty sublist. To handle this, the function should check for empty sublists and return a default value, such as `None` or an empty string, instead of raising an error.
