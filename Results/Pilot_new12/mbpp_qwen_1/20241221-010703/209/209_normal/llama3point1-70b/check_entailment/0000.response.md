Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the task of getting the first element of each sublist. For any list of sublists, the program will iterate through each sublist and extract the first element, returning a list of these elements. This approach works for any non-empty sublists and any number of sublists within the main list. Since the program handles all described cases without issues, it is considered correct.
