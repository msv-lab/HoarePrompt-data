You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of sublists (i.e., a list where each element is also a list).
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #A list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original 'sublists' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of sublists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original `sublists` list. This is achieved using a list comprehension. Potential edge cases include situations where one or more sublists within `sublists` are empty. In such cases, the corresponding element in the returned list will be an empty string, as `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError` if `sublists` contains an empty sublist. To handle this, the function should check for empty sublists and return a default value, such as `None` or an empty string, instead of raising an error.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
