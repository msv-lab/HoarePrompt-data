Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist in the input `sublists` and selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist. This exactly matches the requirement to "get the first element of each sublist." Since the program handles all cases of non-empty sublists correctly and does not need to handle invalid inputs (as per the assumption), it is considered correct according to the given problem description.
