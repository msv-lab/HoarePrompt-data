Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and extract the first element. The function handles the case where a sublist might be empty, as it will simply return an empty string for that sublist. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code correctly handles all potential cases without any issues.
