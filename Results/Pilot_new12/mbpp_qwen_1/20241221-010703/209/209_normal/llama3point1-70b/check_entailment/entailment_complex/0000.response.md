Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of sublists. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `sublists` and return a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The provided comment also correctly mentions the potential edge case where a sublist might be empty and how the current implementation handles it by returning an empty string in such cases. Given the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid, the program satisfies the requirements and behaves as expected.
