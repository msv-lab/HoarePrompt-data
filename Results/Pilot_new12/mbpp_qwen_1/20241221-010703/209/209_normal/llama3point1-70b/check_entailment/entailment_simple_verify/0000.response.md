Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. The original assessment is accurate because the program handles all described cases without issues, and the annotations support this by explicitly stating the behavior of the function at each step. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and annotations.
