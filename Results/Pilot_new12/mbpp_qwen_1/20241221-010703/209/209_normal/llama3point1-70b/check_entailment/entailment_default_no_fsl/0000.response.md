Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. According to the problem description and output hints, if a sublist is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list should be `None` or an empty string, but the current implementation will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `sublist[0]`. To fix this, the code should include a conditional check to handle empty sublists. For example:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] if sublist else None for sublist in sublists]
```

This modified version ensures that the function handles empty sublists gracefully by returning `None` for those cases.
