Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. This works for all potential cases where `sublists` contains sublists with at least one element. If any sublist is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`, but according to the problem description, no specific handling for empty sublists is required. Therefore, assuming the sublists always contain at least one element, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
