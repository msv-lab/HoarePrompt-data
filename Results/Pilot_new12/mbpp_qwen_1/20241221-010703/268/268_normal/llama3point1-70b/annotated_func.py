#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the column (n-1) of the 2D list 'matrix'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the column `(n-1)` of the `matrix`. It iterates over each row in the matrix, extracts the element at index `(n-1)` from each row, and finds the maximum value among these elements. If `n-1` is out of bounds for any row (i.e., `n-1 >= len(row)`), the function will raise an `IndexError`. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the provided code, so it is assumed that the given conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` are always met.
