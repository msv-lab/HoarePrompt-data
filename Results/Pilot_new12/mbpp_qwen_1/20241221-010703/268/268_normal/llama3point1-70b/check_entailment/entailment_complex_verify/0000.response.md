Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the matrix. The annotations clarify that the input conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` ensure that the index is valid, thus avoiding potential `IndexError`s. Given these constraints, the program behaves as expected and meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
