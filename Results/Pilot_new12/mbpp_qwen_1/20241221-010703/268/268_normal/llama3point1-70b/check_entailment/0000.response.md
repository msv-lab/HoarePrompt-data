Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix. Given the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column, and the program achieves this by using a generator expression to extract the n'th element from each row and then applying the `max` function. This approach works for any valid matrix and any column index `n` within the bounds of the matrix columns. Since the program handles the general case correctly and no specific edge cases were identified that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
