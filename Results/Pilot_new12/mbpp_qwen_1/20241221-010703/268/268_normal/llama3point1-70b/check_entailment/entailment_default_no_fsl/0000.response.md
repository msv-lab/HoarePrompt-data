Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` according to the problem description. It returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the given matrix. The code uses a generator expression to extract the n-th element from each row and then applies the `max` function to find the maximum value. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`), the code will work correctly for all potential cases. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would cause the code to fail, and the code does not attempt to handle such cases, which aligns with the problem description assuming valid inputs.
