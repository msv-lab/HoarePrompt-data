Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix, extract the element at index `n - 1`, and find the maximum value among these elements using the `max` function.

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, returning the maximum value from the specified column. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned in the hints that would cause the function to fail. The code handles the given conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` implicitly by raising an `IndexError` if `n-1` is out of bounds for any row, which is consistent with the problem description assuming valid inputs.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case within the assumptions provided, the correctness is **True**.
