Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The provided code uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the element at index `(n-1)`, then passes these elements to the `max()` function to find the maximum value. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, raising an `IndexError` if `n-1` is out of bounds for any row. Since the problem description and the provided code match, and no additional edge cases are required beyond what is already handled (such as non-integer inputs or non-2D list inputs, which are not part of the specified problem), the original assessment of correctness is valid.
