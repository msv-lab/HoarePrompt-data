Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for the maximum value of the n'th column, but the provided program actually finds the maximum value of the (n-1)'th column. This means that the column index passed to the function is off by one. For example, if `n=0`, the function will return the maximum value of the last column instead of the first column. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
