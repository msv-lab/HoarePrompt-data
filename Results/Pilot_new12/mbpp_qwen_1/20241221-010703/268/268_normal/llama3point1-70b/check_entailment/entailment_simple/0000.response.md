Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum value of the \((n-1)\)-th column in the matrix, whereas the problem description asks for the \(n\)-th column. Therefore, the program does not meet the exact requirements specified in the problem description because it uses `row[n - 1]` instead of `row[n]`. For example, if \(n = 0\), the program would attempt to access the last element of each row rather than the first element.

To correctly implement the function according to the problem description, the program should be modified to:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This modification ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum value in the \(n\)-th column of the matrix.
