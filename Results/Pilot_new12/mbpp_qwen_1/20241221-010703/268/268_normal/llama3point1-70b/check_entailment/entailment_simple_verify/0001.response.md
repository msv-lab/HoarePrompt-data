Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version clarifies that `matrix` is a 2D list of integers and `n` is an integer within the valid range for columns (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum value in the n'th column of the matrix using a generator expression within the `max()` function. Since the function adheres to the problem description and the annotations confirm the expected input conditions, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
