Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` generates a generator that yields the (n-1)th element from each row, and `max()` finds the maximum of these elements. This approach handles all cases correctly, including edge cases such as empty matrices or when the column index is out of bounds (though the latter would raise an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior). Since the function follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
