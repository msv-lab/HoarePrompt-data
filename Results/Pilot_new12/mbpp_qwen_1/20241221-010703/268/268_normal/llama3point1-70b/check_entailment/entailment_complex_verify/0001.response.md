Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The annotation states that the function iterates over each row in the matrix, extracts the element at index `(n-1)` from each row, and finds the maximum value among these elements. It also notes that if `n-1` is out of bounds for any row, the function will raise an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior. Since the function follows the problem description for every potential case, and the annotations support this, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains accurate.
