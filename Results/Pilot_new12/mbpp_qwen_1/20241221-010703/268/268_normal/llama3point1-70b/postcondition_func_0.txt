The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the column `(n-1)` of the `matrix`. It iterates over each row in the matrix, extracts the element at index `(n-1)` from each row, and finds the maximum value among these elements. If `n-1` is out of bounds for any row (i.e., `n-1 >= len(row)`), the function will raise an `IndexError`. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the provided code, so it is assumed that the given conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` are always met.
