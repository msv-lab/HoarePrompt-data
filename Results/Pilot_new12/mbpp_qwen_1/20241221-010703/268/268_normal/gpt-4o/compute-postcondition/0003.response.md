Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the `n`th element from each row, and then finds the maximum value among these elements. The function assumes that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, meaning `n` is a valid column index within the matrix. If `n` is out of bounds, the function will still attempt to access the column but will raise an `IndexError`. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionality beyond ensuring `n` is within the valid range of column indices.**
