The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and `n`, which is an integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` representing the column index whose maximum value needs to be found. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and return the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix.**
