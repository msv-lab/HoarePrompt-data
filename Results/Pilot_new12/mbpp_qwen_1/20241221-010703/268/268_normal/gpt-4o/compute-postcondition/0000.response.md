The code creates a new list `nth_column` which contains the nth element from each row of the matrix. This operation does not change the values of the existing `matrix` or `n`. The `matrix` and `n` retain their initial states.

Output State: **matrix is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), `nth_column` is a list containing the nth element from each row of the matrix.**
