Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the `n`-th column of a matrix. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through each row, extracting the `n`-th element, and returning the maximum value. The function handles the scenario where `n` is a valid column index within the matrix, and while it does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is out of bounds, the original assessment already noted that this could lead to an `IndexError`. Since the problem description and output hints do not specify that such edge cases must be handled or that the function should return a specific value in those cases, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
