Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the specified column of a matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the element in the `n`-th column, and then returns the maximum value among these elements. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given inputs. There do not appear to be any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
