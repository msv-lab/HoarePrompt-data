Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n` representing the column index, and returns the maximum value of that column. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., the matrix is a list of lists and `n` is an integer within the range of column indices. The provided program does not explicitly check these conditions, but this aligns with the given assumption.

2. **Column Extraction**: The program extracts the values from the `n`-th column using a list comprehension: `[row[n] for row in matrix]`. This correctly collects all elements at the specified column index across all rows.

3. **Max Value Calculation**: The `max` function is used to find the maximum value from the extracted column. This is the correct operation as per the problem description.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected:
- For `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]` with `n=2`, the maximum value is `19`.
- For `[[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]]` with `n=1`, the maximum value is `10`.
- For `[[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]]` with `n=1`, the maximum value is `11`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and the provided test cases pass, the program is correct.
