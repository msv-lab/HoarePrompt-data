Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function works as expected based on the problem description and the test cases provided. It iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the n'th element from each row, and then finds the maximum value among these elements. The code handles the given examples correctly and there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities. Since the function works for the given assertions and the problem description is satisfied for every potential case under the assumption of valid inputs, the correctness is **True**.
