Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The function should take a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n`.
   - It should return the maximum value among the `n`-th elements of each row in the matrix.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function first extracts the `n`-th element from each row in the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`.
   - It then returns the maximum value from the extracted list using the `max` function: `return max(nth_column)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function assumes that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, which means `n` is a valid column index within the matrix. If `n` is out of bounds, the function will still attempt to access the column but will raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description does not explicitly mention handling out-of-bounds cases, and we are assuming valid input, this behavior is acceptable under the given constraints.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions verify that the function works correctly for different inputs and column indices:
     - `assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19`: The maximum value in the 3rd column (index 2) is 19.
     - `assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10`: The maximum value in the 2nd column (index 1) is 10.
     - `assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11`: The maximum value in the 2nd column (index 1) is 11.

Since the function correctly implements the required functionality and the provided assertions pass, the program is correct according to the problem description.
