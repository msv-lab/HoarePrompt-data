Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the n'th element from each row, and finds the maximum value among these elements. The assertions provided cover various scenarios and validate the function's behavior. Although the output hints mention that the function will raise an `IndexError` if `n` is out of bounds, the problem description does not specify handling such cases, and the original assessment does not address this potential error. Since the question specifies that we should assume valid inputs and focus on the provided problem description and examples, the original assessment remains correct.
