Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function uses a list comprehension to extract the n'th element from each row and then applies the `max` function to find the maximum value among those elements. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios, including:

1. A matrix with varying values and a valid column index (e.g., `func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)`).
2. A matrix with larger values and a valid column index (e.g., `func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1)`).
3. A matrix with even larger values and a valid column index (e.g., `func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1)`).

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound for finding the maximum value in the specified column, the program is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that this function would fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
