You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) representing the column index whose maximum value needs to be found.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #the maximum value among the nth elements of each row in the matrix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the `n`th elements of each row in the matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the `n`th element from each row, and then finds the maximum value among these elements. The function assumes that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, meaning `n` is a valid column index within the matrix. If `n` is out of bounds, the function will still attempt to access the column but will raise an `IndexError`. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionality beyond ensuring `n` is within the valid range of column indices.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
