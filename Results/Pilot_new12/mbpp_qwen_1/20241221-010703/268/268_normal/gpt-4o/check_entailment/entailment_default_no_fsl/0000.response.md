Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function uses list comprehension to extract the n'th element from each row and then applies the `max` function to find the maximum value among those elements. The function also checks that `n` is within the valid range of column indices, which prevents `IndexError`s from occurring due to invalid column indices. Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function handles all tested cases correctly. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionality mentioned in the hints that would cause the function to fail for any potential input within the specified constraints.
