#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd numbers from the original list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers, ensuring that the returned list contains only odd numbers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function correctly handles both empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list in such cases.
