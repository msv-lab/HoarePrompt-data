The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers, ensuring that the returned list contains only odd numbers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function correctly handles both empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list in such cases.
