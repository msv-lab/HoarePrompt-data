Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters out odd numbers from a list. Given the problem description to filter odd numbers, the program uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would cause this program to fail based on the description. Therefore, the program is correct.
