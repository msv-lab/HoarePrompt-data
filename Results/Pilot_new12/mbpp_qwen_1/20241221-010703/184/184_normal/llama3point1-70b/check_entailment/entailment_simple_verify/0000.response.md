Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The annotations confirm that the program returns a list of odd numbers from the original list `nums`. Since the problem description requires writing a function to filter odd numbers, the program meets this requirement. The annotations do not indicate any issues with the program's behavior or logic. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
