Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The annotations also mention that the function handles both empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list, which aligns with the problem description of filtering odd numbers. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment of its correctness is maintained.
