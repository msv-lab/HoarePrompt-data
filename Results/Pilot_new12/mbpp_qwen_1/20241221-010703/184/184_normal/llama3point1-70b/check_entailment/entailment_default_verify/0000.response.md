Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list. Since the problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, and the provided implementation meets this requirement without any apparent issues, the original assessment of the program's correctness as True remains valid.
