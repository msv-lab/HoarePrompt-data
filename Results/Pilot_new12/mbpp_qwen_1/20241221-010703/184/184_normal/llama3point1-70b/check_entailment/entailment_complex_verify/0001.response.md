Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates through each number in `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (`num % 2 != 0`). This logic is consistent with the problem description, which requires writing a function to filter odd numbers. The annotated version also mentions that the function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
