Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from the input list. The provided code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic is consistent with the problem description of filtering odd numbers. The output hints also confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing only even numbers by returning an empty list. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
