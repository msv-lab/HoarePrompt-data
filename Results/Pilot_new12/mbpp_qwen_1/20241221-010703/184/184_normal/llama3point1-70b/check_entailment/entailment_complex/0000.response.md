Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out even numbers, ensuring that only odd numbers are included in the returned list. The function also handles edge cases appropriately by returning an empty list if the input list is empty or contains only even numbers. Since the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
