Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the input list. The logic inside the function, which filters out odd numbers using the condition `num % 2 != 0`, is correctly implemented and will work for all valid integer inputs. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, and given that we are assuming valid input, the program meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
