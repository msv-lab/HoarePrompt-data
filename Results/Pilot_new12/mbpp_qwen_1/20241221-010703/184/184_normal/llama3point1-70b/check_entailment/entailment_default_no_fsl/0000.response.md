Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums` using a list comprehension. It correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty list, which results in an empty list being returned.
- A list containing only even numbers, which also results in an empty list being returned.
- A list containing a mix of odd and even numbers, which returns a list containing only the odd numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected for all described cases and the problem description is met without any issues, the correctness is **True**.
