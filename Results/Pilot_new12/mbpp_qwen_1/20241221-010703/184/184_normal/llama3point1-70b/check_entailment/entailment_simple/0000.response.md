Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` iterates over each number in `nums`, checks if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), and includes it in the resulting list if the condition is met. Since the function always filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers, it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
