Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the list and includes it in the result if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The function handles edge cases such as an empty list by returning an empty list, and it correctly filters out all even numbers. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
