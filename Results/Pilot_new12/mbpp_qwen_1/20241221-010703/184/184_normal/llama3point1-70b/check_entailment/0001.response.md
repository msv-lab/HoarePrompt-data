Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. For any input list of integers, the list comprehension iterates through each number and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic is correct and will work for all potential cases involving integer inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
