Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the state of the program before the function call and the behavior within the function. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and retains only odd numbers from the input list, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The annotations confirm that the function processes a list of integers and returns a list of odd integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
