Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` filters out the odd numbers from a given list of integers using a list comprehension. The function checks each number in the list to see if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`) and includes it in the result if true. 

Based on the provided assertions:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.
- `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.
- `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which are the odd numbers in the list.

The function correctly filters out the odd numbers in all provided examples. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario where this function would fail based on the problem description. Hence, the function is correct.
