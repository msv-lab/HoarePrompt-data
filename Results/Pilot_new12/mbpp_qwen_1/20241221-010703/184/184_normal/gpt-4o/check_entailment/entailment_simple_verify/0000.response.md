Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from a given list of integers. Each assertion in the annotated code matches the expected output of filtering odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which correctly identifies odd numbers. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the provided examples, the function is correct.
