Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list and returns a list of odd numbers. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function, which is to accept a list of integers and return a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The function logic, as described in the annotations, correctly filters out even numbers and retains only the odd numbers, satisfying the problem description. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is correct.
