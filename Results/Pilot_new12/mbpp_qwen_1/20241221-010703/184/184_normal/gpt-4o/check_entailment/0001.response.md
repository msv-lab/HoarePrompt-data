Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list and returns a list of odd numbers. The function works as expected for the given assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and includes it in the result only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic correctly filters out even numbers and retains odd numbers, satisfying the problem description for the provided test cases and any similar cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
