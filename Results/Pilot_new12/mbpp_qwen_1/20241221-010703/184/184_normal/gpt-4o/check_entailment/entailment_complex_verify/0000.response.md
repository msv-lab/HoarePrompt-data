Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that filters odd numbers from a given list of integers. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this functionality using a list comprehension to filter out even numbers. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected, returning lists of odd numbers for the given inputs. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the function's behavior and purpose, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
