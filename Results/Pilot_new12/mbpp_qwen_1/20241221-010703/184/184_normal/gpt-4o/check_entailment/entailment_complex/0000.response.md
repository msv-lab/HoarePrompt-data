Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. This is evident from the list comprehensions used within the function, which filters out even numbers using the condition `if num % 2 != 0`.

The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate the function's behavior for different inputs:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

These results align with the expected behavior of filtering out even numbers and retaining only the odd numbers. The program does not perform any operations outside of the described task, and it handles all cases where the input is a valid list of integers, as per the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
