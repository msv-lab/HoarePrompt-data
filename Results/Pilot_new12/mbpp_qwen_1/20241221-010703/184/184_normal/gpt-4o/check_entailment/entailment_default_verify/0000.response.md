Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a list of only the odd numbers from the input list. The function works correctly for all provided test cases and there are no indications that it fails under any valid input scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
