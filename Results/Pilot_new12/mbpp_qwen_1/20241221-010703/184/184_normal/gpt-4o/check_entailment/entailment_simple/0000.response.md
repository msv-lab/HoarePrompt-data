Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is evident from the following points:

1. The function definition `def func_1(nums):` indicates that it accepts a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` filters out all even numbers, ensuring that only odd numbers are included in the returned list.
3. The provided test cases assert that the function works correctly with different inputs:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` should return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
   - `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` should return `[45, 67, 93]`.
   - `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` should return `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since the function performs the exact operation described in the problem statement and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.
