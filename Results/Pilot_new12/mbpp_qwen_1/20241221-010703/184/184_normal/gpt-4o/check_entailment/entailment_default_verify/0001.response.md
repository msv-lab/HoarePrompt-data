Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and retains only the odd numbers from the input list. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list of integers and returning a list of odd integers. The function handles both non-empty and empty lists appropriately, returning an empty list if there are no odd numbers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
