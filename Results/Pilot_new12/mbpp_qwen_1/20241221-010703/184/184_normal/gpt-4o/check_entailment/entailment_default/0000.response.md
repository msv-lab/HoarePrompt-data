Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The list comprehension in the function iterates through each number in `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including lists with all odd numbers, lists with mixed even and odd numbers, and lists with no odd numbers. Since the code handles all these cases as expected and the output hints confirm that there are no missing functionalities, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
