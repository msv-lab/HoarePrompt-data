#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all integers from list1, list2, and list3 combined
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. The function handles the case where any of the input lists might be empty. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function will correctly handle duplicate integers by including them in the sorted output based on their order in the concatenated list.
