Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input parameters. It concatenates these lists into a single list, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. This exactly matches the problem description which states that the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function correctly handles the concatenation and sorting of the lists, ensuring that the returned list is sorted and contains all elements from the input lists. Since the input lists are assumed to be valid (lists of integers), the function behaves as expected in all cases.
