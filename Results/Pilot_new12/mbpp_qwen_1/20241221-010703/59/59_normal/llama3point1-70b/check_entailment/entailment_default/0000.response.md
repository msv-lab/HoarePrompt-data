Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single sorted list using the `sorted` function. Given the problem description, the function should merge and sort the three lists into a single sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function concatenates the three lists and sorts the resulting list, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function correctly handles the merging and sorting of the lists and there are no specific edge cases mentioned that would cause it to fail, the program is correct for every potential case.
