Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using the built-in `sorted` function. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases where the input lists contain any type of elements that support comparison (e.g., numbers, strings). Since the function returns a sorted list, it meets the requirement of merging and sorting the three input lists. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
