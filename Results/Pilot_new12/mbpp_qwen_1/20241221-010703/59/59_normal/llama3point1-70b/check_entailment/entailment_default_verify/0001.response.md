Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly merges and sorts three lists of integers. The output hints confirm that the function handles empty lists and includes duplicates based on their order in the concatenated list, which aligns with the requirement to merge and sort three lists. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would indicate the function fails to meet the problem description, and the provided code meets all the criteria stated in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
