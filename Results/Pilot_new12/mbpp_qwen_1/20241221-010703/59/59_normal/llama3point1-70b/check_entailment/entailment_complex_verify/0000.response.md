Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes three lists of integers as input, concatenates them, sorts the resulting list, and returns it. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description of merging and sorting three lists. The annotations also indicate that the function handles empty lists and duplicate integers appropriately, ensuring the output is always a sorted list containing all integers from the input lists. Since there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail and the provided code meets the requirements, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
