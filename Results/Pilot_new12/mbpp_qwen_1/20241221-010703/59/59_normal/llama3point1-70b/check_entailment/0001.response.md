Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list by concatenating the three lists and then sorting them using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted regardless of the initial order of elements in the input lists. Since the problem description only requires merging and sorting three lists, and the provided function accomplishes this correctly for all potential cases, the function is deemed correct.
