Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` concatenates three lists and then sorts the combined list. Given the problem description to merge three lists into a single sorted list, this function correctly fulfills the requirement. The output hints confirm that the function handles empty lists and includes duplicates based on their order in the concatenated list, which aligns with the problem description. There are no specific edge cases mentioned that the code fails to handle, and the function behaves as expected for merging and sorting the lists.
