Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list by concatenating the three lists and then sorting them using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The annotations confirm that the function handles the case where any of the input lists might be empty and correctly combines and sorts the lists. Since the problem description only requires merging and sorting three lists, and the provided function accomplishes this correctly for all potential cases, the function is deemed correct. The annotations do not indicate any issues with the function's behavior or correctness.
