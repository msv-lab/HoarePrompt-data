Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single list and sorts the combined list. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles the concatenation and sorting of the lists, even if any of the input lists are empty. Since the problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list, and the function provided meets this requirement, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
