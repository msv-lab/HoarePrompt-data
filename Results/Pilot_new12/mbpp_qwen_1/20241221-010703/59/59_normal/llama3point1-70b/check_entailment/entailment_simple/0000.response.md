Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input and returns a single sorted list containing all the integers from the three input lists combined. The function uses the `sorted` function to sort the concatenated list, which ensures that the output is always sorted, regardless of the order of elements in the input lists. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or behaviors (such as handling invalid inputs), and the given implementation satisfies the basic requirement of merging and sorting the lists, the program is correct.
