Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list by concatenating the three lists and then sorting them using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, combining and sorting the integers from the three input lists. Since the problem description only requires merging and sorting three lists, and the provided function accomplishes this correctly for all potential cases, the function is indeed correct.
