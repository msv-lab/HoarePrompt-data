Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the three lists. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly combines the three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and then sorts them using the `sorted` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list, and the function accomplishes this correctly under the assumption of valid input (as stated in the annotation), the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
