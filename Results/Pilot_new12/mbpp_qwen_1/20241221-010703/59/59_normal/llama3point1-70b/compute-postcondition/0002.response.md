Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. The function handles the case where any of the input lists might be empty. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function will correctly handle duplicate integers by including them in the sorted output based on their order in the concatenated list.**

This summary focuses on the actions performed by the code and includes the relevant behavior of handling empty lists and duplicates, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the function's purpose and final state.
