`combined_list` is sorted to create `sorted_list`. The original order of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` within `combined_list` is maintained, but the entire list is now sorted. Since the exact elements of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `sorted_list`, but we know it contains all elements from `combined_list` in sorted order.

Output State: **`combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in that order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `list3` is unchanged, `sorted_list` is the sorted version of `combined_list`**
