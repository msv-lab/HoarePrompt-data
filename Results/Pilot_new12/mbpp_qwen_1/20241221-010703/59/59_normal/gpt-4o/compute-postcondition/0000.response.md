The code concatenates `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a new list called `combined_list`. The lengths of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are added together to form the length of `combined_list`. However, the actual contents of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are not altered; only a new list `combined_list` is created containing all elements from the three original lists in sequence.

Output State: **`combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in that order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `list3` is unchanged**
