Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It combines these lists into one `combined_list`, sorts this combined list, and returns the sorted list. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function ensures that all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are included in the returned sorted list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns a single sorted list containing all the elements from the input lists.**
