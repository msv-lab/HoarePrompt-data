Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` concatenates the three input lists and sorts the resulting combined list. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, merging and sorting the lists correctly. The test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicates and partially sorted lists, and the function passes all the assertions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct based on the provided information.
