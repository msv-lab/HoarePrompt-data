Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and sorts it. The function concatenates the three input lists using `list1 + list2 + list3` and then sorts the resulting combined list using `sorted()`. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists that are already partially sorted. The function passes all the given assertions, indicating that it handles these cases correctly. Since no edge cases or potential issues were found that would make the program incorrect, the function appears to be correct for every potential case described in the problem.
