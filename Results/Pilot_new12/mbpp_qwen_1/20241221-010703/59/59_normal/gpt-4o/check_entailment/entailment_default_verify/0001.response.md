Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three input lists into a single sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function combines the lists and sorts them without any issues. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicates and partially sorted lists, and the function passes all assertions. Since the function behaves as expected and the output hints support this, there is no evidence to suggest the original assessment is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
