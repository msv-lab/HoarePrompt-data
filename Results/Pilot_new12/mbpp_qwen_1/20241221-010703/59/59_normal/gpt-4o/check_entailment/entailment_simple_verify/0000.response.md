Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. The annotations clearly indicate that the function first combines the three input lists and then sorts the combined list, ensuring that the result is a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes all assertions, demonstrating its correctness for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
