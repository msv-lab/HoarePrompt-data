Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. The implementation first combines the three lists using `list1 + list2 + list3` and then sorts the combined list using `sorted()`. This approach ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order, which meets the requirement of merging and sorting three lists into one.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios including lists with duplicates and different ranges of values. The function passes all the given assertions, indicating that it works correctly for the provided examples and follows the problem description accurately for those cases. Since no counterexample or failure case has been identified, the program can be considered correct.
