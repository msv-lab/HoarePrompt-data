Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list, and then sorts this combined list. The returned value is the sorted list containing all elements from the three input lists in ascending order. This behavior aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
