Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single sorted list. This aligns with the problem description which states "Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list."

2. **Combining Lists**: The function combines the three input lists into a single list called `combined_list` using the `+` operator. This correctly merges all elements from the three input lists into one list.

3. **Sorting**: The function then sorts the `combined_list` using the `sorted()` function. Sorting the combined list ensures that the final output is a single list containing all elements from the input lists, arranged in ascending order.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the sorted list, which contains all elements from the input lists in a sorted manner, as required.

Since the function performs all the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome (merging and sorting the lists) without any deviations or additional unnecessary operations, the program is correct according to the problem description.
