Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` combines the three input lists into one, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. The examples given in the problem description confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description, and the code handles the merging and sorting of the lists correctly. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
