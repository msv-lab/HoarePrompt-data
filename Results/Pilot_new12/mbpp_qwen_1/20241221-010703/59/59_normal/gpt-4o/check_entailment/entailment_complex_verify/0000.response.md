Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list as required. The annotated version confirms that the function combines the three input lists into one and then sorts them, ensuring that the output is a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes all the assertions, indicating its correctness. The annotations further support the accuracy of the function's behavior by clearly describing each step, from combining the lists to sorting them and returning the result. Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations validate its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
