The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list such that `2 <= n`. 

- If the length of the list `arr` is less than 2, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function sorts the list `arr` and then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This smallest difference is stored in the variable `min_diff`.
- Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, and return either 0 or the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.
