#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that 2 <= n.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers, and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that n is greater than or equal to 2
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (and `n >= 2`), and `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list such that `2 <= n`. 

- If the length of the list `arr` is less than 2, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function sorts the list `arr` and then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This smallest difference is stored in the variable `min_diff`.
- Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, and return either 0 or the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.
