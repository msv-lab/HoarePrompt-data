Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It first checks if the length of the array is less than 2 and returns 0 in that case. For arrays with at least two elements, it sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. The smallest difference is then returned. Given the assertions provided, the function appears to work correctly for the examples given, and the logic aligns with the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail under valid input conditions.
