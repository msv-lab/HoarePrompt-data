Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array (list of integers). Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the length of the list `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Sorting**: The function then sorts the list `arr`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that the minimum difference will be found between consecutive elements.
3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: After sorting, the function iterates through the list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This difference is stored in the variable `min_diff`.
4. **Returning Result**: Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which represents the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list.

The problem description asks for a function that finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function correctly follows this logic by ensuring that the list is sorted and then finding the smallest difference between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
