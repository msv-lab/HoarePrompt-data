Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The function needs to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
2. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns 0. Since the problem specifies \(2 \leq n\), this condition is sufficient to handle invalid inputs within the given constraints.
3. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted using `arr = sorted(arr)`. Sorting the array ensures that the smallest differences will be between consecutive elements.
4. **Finding Minimum Difference**: A variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of consecutive elements and updating `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.
5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which contains the smallest difference found.

The program handles all potential cases as described:
- It returns 0 if the array has fewer than 2 elements.
- It correctly computes the minimum difference by sorting the array and finding the smallest difference between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
