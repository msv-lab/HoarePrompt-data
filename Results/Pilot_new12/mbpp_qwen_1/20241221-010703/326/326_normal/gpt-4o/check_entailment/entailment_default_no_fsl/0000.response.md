Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles the case where the length of the array is less than 2 by returning 0. For arrays with a length of 2 or more, it sorts the array and then iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the smallest difference is found, and the code produces the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the problem description.
