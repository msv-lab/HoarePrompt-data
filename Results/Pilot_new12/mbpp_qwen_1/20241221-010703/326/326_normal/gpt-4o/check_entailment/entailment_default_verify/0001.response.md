Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function handles the edge case where the length of the array is less than 2 by returning 0. It sorts the array and iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, considering all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description. Since the function correctly implements the required logic and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
