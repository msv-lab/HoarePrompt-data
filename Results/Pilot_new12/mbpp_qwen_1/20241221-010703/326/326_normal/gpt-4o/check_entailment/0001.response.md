Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0 since there are not enough elements to compute a difference. It then sorts the array and iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the smallest possible difference is found. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness for different scenarios. Since no counterexample has been found where the function does not meet the problem description, the program is considered correct.
