Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the array has fewer than 2 elements, in which case it returns 0 since there are no pairs to compare. Then, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Given the nature of the problem and the implementation, it appears that the function will work correctly for all potential cases of input arrays.
