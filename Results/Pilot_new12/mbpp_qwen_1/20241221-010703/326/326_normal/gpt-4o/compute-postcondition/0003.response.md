The code `arr = sorted(arr)` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `arr`, we only know that `arr` is a list of integers and its length `n` is greater than or equal to 2. After sorting, the smallest element in the original list will become the first element in the sorted list, and the largest element will become the last element in the sorted list.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers (in ascending order), and `n` is an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `n` is an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
