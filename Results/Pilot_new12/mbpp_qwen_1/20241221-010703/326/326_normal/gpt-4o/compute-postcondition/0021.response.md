Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list such that `2 <= n`. 

- If the length of the list `arr` is less than 2, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function sorts the list `arr` and then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This smallest difference is stored in the variable `min_diff`.
- Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, and return either 0 or the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the length of the list is less than 2 by returning 0.
- However, the function assumes that the input list `arr` contains only integers and does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer elements or empty lists. To fully address these cases, additional checks should be included to ensure that all elements in `arr` are integers and that `arr` is not empty.
