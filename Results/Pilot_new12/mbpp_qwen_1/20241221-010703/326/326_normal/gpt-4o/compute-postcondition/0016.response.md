The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, and since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `diff` represents the difference between the fourth element and the third element of `arr`. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`**
