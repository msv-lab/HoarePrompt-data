Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` and `n >= 2`.
   - `min_diff` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - For each iteration, `diff` is calculated as `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
   - If `diff < min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`.

3. **Output State After Loop Executes:**
   - After the loop completes, `min_diff` will be the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.

4. **Determine the Final Values:**
   - Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, it checks the differences between all pairs of consecutive elements in the list.
   - The final value of `min_diff` will be the smallest of these differences.

5. **Special Cases:**
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n == 2`), then `min_diff` remains `float('inf')` because there are no pairs to compare.

### Final Output State

Given the analysis above, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

**Output State: **`min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (and `n >= 2`), and `arr` is a sorted list of integers.**
