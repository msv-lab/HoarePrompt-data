The code assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` will now hold this value. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `min_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1], `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
