The code assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and this value is less than `min_diff`, `min_diff` will now hold the same value as `diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and the current value of `min_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**
