According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `min_diff` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the condition `i < n - 1` will hold true if `n` is at least 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, the value of `min_diff` remains unchanged, so it stays as it was before.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `min_diff` remains unchanged.**
