The code calculates the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Since `i` is initially 2, `diff` will be `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`**
