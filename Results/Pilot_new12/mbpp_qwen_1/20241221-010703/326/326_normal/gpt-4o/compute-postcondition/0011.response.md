The code assigns the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` to the variable `diff`. Here, `i` is initially set to 1, so `arr[i + 1]` refers to `arr[2]` and `arr[i]` refers to `arr[1]`. The difference between these two elements is stored in `diff`, while the values of `arr`, `n`, and `min_diff` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `min_diff` remains unchanged, `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
