The code initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `arr` or `n`. Therefore, the only change is in the introduction of the new variable `min_diff` with the value `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `min_diff` is infinity (`float('inf')`).**
