The code calculates the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in the list `arr`. Since `i` is 0, this means `diff` is assigned the value `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**
