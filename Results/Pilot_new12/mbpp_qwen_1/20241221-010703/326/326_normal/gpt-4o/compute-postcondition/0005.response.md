According to the code, the loop will iterate over pairs of adjacent elements in the list `arr`. The loop starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n - 2`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-2`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `min_diff` is initially set to infinity (`float('inf')`).

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the list `arr` has at least two elements (which is already given as `n >= 2`). However, since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, we need to ensure there are at least two elements to compare.

Here are the key points to consider:
1. The list `arr` must have at least 2 elements to allow the loop to run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
2. The variable `min_diff` is used to track the minimum difference between adjacent elements, but its value doesn't affect whether the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can run, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
