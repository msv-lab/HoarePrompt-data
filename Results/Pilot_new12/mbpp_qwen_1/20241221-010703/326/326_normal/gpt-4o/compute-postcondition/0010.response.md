According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `arr` from index 0 to `n-2`. The variable `i` is incremented at each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `min_diff` is either the initial value or has been updated based on the difference between consecutive elements in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
- For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `n-1`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the condition `i < n-1` will hold true as long as `n` is greater than 2. Given that `i` starts at 0 and is incremented, the only necessary adjustment is to increment `i`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `min_diff` remains unchanged.**
