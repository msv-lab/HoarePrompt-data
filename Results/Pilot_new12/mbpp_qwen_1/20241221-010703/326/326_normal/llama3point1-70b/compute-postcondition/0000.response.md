`arr` is sorted using the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order. The original list `arr` remains unchanged, and the new sorted list replaces the original `arr`. The `target` variable is not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer**
