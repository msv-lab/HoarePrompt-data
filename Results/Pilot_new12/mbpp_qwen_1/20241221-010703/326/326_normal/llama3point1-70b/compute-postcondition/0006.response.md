Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list so far (initially `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`), `i` is 1, and `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`. If `diff` is found to be less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`.***
