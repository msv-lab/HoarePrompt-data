The code initializes the variable `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `arr` or `target`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with only the new variable `min_diff` being initialized.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
