State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, target is an integer, min_diff is infinity (`float('inf')`), `i` is 0, `len(arr)` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of the list `arr` must be greater than 1. This ensures there are at least two elements in the list, allowing the loop to run from `i = 0` to `len(arr) - 2`.
3. Before the loop starts, we don't have any specific information about the value of `i`, but since the loop starts from `i = 0`, `i` should be initialized to `0`.
4. The initial state of `min_diff` being set to infinity (`float('inf')`) is correct and doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.
