The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, which is an integer. The function returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`, updating this minimum difference if a smaller difference is found during the iteration.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `target`, and returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.**
