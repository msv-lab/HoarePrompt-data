`diff` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `diff` is now `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The `min_diff` remains unchanged, `arr` stays a sorted list of integers, `target` stays an integer, and `i` is incremented to 3.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list so far, `i` is 3, and `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**
