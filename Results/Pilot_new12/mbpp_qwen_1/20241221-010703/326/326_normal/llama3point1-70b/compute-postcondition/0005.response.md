The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, and since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `min_diff` was previously equal to `diff`. Therefore, `min_diff` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, target is an integer, `min_diff` equals `diff` which is less than `min_diff` previously, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`**
