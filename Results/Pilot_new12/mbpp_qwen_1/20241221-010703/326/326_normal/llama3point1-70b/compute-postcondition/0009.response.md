The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Given that `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `min_diff` is now set to this absolute difference. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `i`, and `diff`) are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `i` is 3, and `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**
