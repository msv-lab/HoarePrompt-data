The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this minimum absolute difference. The function ignores the `target` parameter since it is not used within the function. An edge case to consider is when the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, in which case the function should handle this appropriately by returning an error or an indication that no valid difference can be computed.
