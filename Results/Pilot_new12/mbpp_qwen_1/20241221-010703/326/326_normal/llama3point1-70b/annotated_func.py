#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(arr[-2] - arr[-1])`. If during any iteration, `diff` is found to be less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list 'arr', updated if a smaller difference is found during the iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this minimum absolute difference. The function ignores the `target` parameter since it is not used within the function. An edge case to consider is when the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, in which case the function should handle this appropriately by returning an error or an indication that no valid difference can be computed.
