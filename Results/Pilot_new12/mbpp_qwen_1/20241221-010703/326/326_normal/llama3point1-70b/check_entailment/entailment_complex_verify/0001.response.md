Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

- The function first sorts the array, ensuring that all potential pairs are adjacent after sorting.
- It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements and updating `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.
- The function returns `min_diff`, which represents the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list.

Since the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and there are no discrepancies or edge cases mentioned that would invalidate the functionâ€™s correctness, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is True.
