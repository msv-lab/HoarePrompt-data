Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the provided code only considers the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach is correct if the input array has at least two elements, but the output hints indicate an edge case where the list `arr` has fewer than two elements. In such a case, the function should handle this appropriately, but the current implementation does not do so. It simply starts iterating from the first element to the second-to-last element, which will result in an error if the array has fewer than two elements. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate because the function does not account for the scenario where the input array has fewer than two elements.
