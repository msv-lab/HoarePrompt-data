Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1(arr, target)` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts an array (`arr`) and a target value (`target`). However, as per the problem description, the target value is not used in the computation of the minimum difference. This is acceptable because the function is expected to work with any array of integers, and the target value is ignored.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array `arr` using `sorted(arr)`. Sorting the array ensures that any two consecutive elements in the sorted array have the smallest possible difference among all pairs of elements in the array.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference encountered using the variable `min_diff`. After the loop completes, `min_diff` contains the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the minimum difference (`min_diff`).

Given these points, the function correctly identifies and returns the minimum difference between any two elements in the input array. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
