Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It first sorts the array, which ensures that all potential pairs are adjacent after sorting. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements and keeping track of the minimum difference found. This approach guarantees that the function will find the smallest difference between any two elements in the array. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that this function would fail to handle based on the given problem description.
