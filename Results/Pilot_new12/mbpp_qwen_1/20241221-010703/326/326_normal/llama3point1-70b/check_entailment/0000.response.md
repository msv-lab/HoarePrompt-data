Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent to each other. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between consecutive elements and updating the minimum difference accordingly. This approach guarantees that the minimum difference found is indeed the smallest difference between any two elements in the array. Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and the logic is sound, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
