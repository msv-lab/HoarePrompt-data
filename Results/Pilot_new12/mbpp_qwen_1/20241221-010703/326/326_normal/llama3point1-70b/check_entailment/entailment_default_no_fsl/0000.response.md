Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` is named `func_1`, but the problem description asks for a function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, not just consecutive elements. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input array has fewer than two elements, which is an important edge case. For example, if `arr` is an empty list or contains only one element, the current implementation will raise an error because it tries to access `arr[i+1]` when `i` is the last index. The function should return an appropriate value (like `None` or a specific message) when the array size is less than 2.
