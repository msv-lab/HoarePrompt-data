You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `diff` is `abs(arr[-2] - arr[-1])`. If during any iteration, `diff` is found to be less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.
    return min_diff
    #`The program returns min_diff which is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list 'arr', updated if a smaller difference is found during the iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this minimum absolute difference. The function ignores the `target` parameter since it is not used within the function. An edge case to consider is when the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, in which case the function should handle this appropriately by returning an error or an indication that no valid difference can be computed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
