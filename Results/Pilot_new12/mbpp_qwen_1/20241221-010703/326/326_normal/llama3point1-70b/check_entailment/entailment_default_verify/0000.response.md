Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided program logic for finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array appears correct based on the initial assessment, the output hints introduce a new consideration: the handling of edge cases where the list `arr` has fewer than two elements. The current implementation does not address this scenario, which means it would not return a meaningful value when given such input. Since the problem description implies that the function should handle all potential cases correctly, the program's failure to handle this edge case makes it incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this oversight.
