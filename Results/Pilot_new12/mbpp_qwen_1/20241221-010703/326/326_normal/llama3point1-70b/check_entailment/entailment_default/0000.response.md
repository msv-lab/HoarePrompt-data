Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts an array `arr` and finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The function first sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest differences are between consecutive elements. Then, it iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements. The function handles the case where the array has fewer than two elements by using `float('inf')` as the initial value for `min_diff`, which ensures that the function returns a meaningful value even if the array is too short to contain two elements. The output hints confirm that the function correctly calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements, and there are no examples provided in the hints that show the code failing to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
