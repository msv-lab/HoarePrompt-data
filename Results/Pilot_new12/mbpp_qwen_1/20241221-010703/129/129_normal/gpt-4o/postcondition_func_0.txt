The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value. There are no additional actions performed beyond returning the ASCII value of the character. This function handles the case where `char` is an empty string by returning 0, which is the ASCII value of the null character `\x00`. However, it does not handle non-string inputs or characters outside the valid ASCII range.
