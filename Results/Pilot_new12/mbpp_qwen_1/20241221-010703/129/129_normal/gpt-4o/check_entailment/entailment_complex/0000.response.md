Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the ASCII value of a character. The `func_1` function achieves this by using the built-in `ord()` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character. The function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII numeric value.

The program includes assertions that test the function with different characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), and these tests confirm that the function is correctly calculating the ASCII values. The function also handles the case of an empty string by returning 0, which is the ASCII value of the null character `\x00`, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. Since the problem description does not specify how the function should handle empty strings, this additional behavior does not violate the requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
