Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of the given character using the built-in `ord` function. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character, and the function provided does exactly that. The test cases given (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) confirm that the function works as expected for these specific characters.

While the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-string inputs or characters outside the valid ASCII range, the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle these cases. Therefore, based on the provided information, the function is correct for every potential case specified in the problem description.
