Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The `assert` statements given in the test cases verify that the function works correctly for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the function `func_1` returns the correct ASCII values for these characters, and the `ord()` function works for all printable ASCII characters, we can conclude that the program will work correctly for any single character input, meeting the problem description for every potential case.
