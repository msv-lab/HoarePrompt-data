Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the ASCII value of a character, and it achieves this by using the built-in `ord()` function in Python, which returns the ASCII value of the given character. The assertions in the code verify that the function correctly computes the ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which are 65, 82, and 83, respectively. Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases, and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases, the program is correct.
