Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The test cases provided (`'A' == 65`, `'R' == 82`, `'S' == 83`) are correct according to the ASCII table. Since the function works as expected for these cases and there are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
