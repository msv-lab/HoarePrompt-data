Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The provided assertions test the function with valid inputs ('A', 'R', 'S') and verify that the outputs (65, 82, 83) are correct according to the ASCII table. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, taking a single character string and returning its ASCII value. Since the function behaves as specified and the provided test cases are correct, the original assessment of correctness being True remains accurate.
