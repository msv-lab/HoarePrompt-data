Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the provided assertions confirm that it works for 'A', 'R', and 'S'. The output hints also align with this behavior, stating that the function handles an empty string by returning the ASCII value of the null character `\x00`, which is 0. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state how the function should behave with an empty string or characters outside the valid ASCII range, and the provided code does not handle these cases, we can still consider the code correct under the assumption that the input will always be a valid single character string. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
