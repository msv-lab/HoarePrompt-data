#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII numeric value of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value. There are no additional actions performed beyond returning the ASCII value of the character. This function handles the case where `char` is an empty string by returning 0, which is the ASCII value of the null character `\x00`. However, it does not handle non-string inputs or characters outside the valid ASCII range.
