Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. Given the problem description, which states that the function should return the ASCII value of a single character, this implementation satisfies the requirement for all possible inputs. Since there is no edge case or specific input scenario that the provided function fails to handle correctly, the function is considered correct.
