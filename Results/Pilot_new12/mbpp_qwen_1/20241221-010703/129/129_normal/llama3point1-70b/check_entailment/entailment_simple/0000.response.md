Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. Since the problem description asks to write a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the provided function does exactly that, the program is correct. The function handles all valid single-character strings as expected, and the behavior aligns perfectly with the problem statement.
