Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should find the ASCII value of a character. The function does not need to handle any edge cases because the problem description and the annotation specify that the input will always be valid. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described.
