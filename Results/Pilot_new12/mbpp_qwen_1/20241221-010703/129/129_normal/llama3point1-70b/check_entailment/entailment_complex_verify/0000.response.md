Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotations confirm that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII value, which aligns with the problem description. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would cause the program to fail, and the code accurately implements the intended functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
