Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. Since the function handles a single character as input and returns its ASCII value, which aligns perfectly with the problem description, there are no potential cases where this program would fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
