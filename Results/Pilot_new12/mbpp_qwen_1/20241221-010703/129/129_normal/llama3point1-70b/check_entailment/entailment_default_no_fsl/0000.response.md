Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the function provided does exactly that. Since the input is assumed to be a valid single character string, there are no edge cases to consider in this context. The function works as expected for all valid inputs, thus it is correct according to the problem description.
