Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII value, aligning perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the annotations that the function fails to handle, and the code accurately implements the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
