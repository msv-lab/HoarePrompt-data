Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, taking a single character string and returning its ASCII value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the annotations that this function fails to handle. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
