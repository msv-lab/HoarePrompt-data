Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotated version confirms that the input `char` is expected to be a single character string, and the program returns the ordinal value of this character. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character. There are no potential cases where this program would fail under the assumption of valid input.
