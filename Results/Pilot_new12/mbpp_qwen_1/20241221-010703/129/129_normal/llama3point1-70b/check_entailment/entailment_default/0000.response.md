Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The function works for every potential case where the input is a single character string, as specified in the problem description. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the output hints that indicate the code does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
