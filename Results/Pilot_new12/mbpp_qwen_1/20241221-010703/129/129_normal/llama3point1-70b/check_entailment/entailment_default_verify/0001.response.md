Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a single character string and returning its ASCII value. Since the problem description requires the function to return the ASCII value of a single character, and the code fulfills this requirement without any issues or edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
