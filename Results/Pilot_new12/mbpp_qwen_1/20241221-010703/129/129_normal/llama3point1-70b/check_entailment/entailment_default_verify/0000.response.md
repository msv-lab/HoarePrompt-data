Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended by accepting a single character string and returning its ASCII value. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the output hints that suggest the program is incorrect. Thus, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
