#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ordinal value of the character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value. The function correctly implements this behavior by using the built-in `ord()` function to obtain the ASCII value of the input character. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately reflects the intended functionality. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the ASCII value of the input character `char`.
