The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function and does not actually execute any code that would change the values of the variables. The docstring defines what the function is supposed to do but does not run any code that would alter the state of the variables. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the understanding of what the `char` variable should be used for, but its actual value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`char` is a single character string**
