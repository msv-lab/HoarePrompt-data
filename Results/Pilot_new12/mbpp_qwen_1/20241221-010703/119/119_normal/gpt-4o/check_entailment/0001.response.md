Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns a tuple with the second parameter followed by the first parameter. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including positive integers, and confirm that the function works as expected for those inputs. Since the function logic is straightforward and the test cases are sufficient to validate its correctness, there are no potential cases found where the program does not work as described.
