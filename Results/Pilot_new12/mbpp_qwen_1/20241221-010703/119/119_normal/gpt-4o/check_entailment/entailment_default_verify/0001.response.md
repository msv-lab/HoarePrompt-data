Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` swaps the two input parameters and returns them in a tuple with the second parameter first. The provided test cases cover basic integer inputs, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting integers or floats and returning a tuple with the swapped values. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support this behavior, the original assessment is accurate. There are no indications of incorrect behavior or missing functionality based on the provided information.
