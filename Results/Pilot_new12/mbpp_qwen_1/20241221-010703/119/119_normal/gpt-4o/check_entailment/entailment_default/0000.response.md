Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them in a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. The assertions in the code confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. Since the problem description and the output hints indicate that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, and the code fulfills this requirement without any issues, the program is correct for every potential case.
