Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. This matches the problem description exactly. The assertions provided also verify this behavior for different inputs. Since the code handles the swapping logic correctly and the provided examples cover various cases without any issues, the program is correct for every potential case.
