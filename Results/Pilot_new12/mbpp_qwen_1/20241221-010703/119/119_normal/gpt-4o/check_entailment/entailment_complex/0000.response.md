Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the first element is the original value of `b` and the second element is the original value of `a`. The function always performs the required operation regardless of the types of the inputs (assuming they are numbers, as stated in the problem description). The provided assertions also correctly validate the function's behavior for different inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
