Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios with positive integers, and the annotated code aligns with the problem description. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that suggest the function does not meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
