Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes all of them. The annotated version of the code supports this reasoning, showing that before the function call, `a` and `b` are indeed numbers, and the function correctly returns the tuple `(b, a)`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
