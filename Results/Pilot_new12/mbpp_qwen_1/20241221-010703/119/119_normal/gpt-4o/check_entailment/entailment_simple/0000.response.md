Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The function consistently returns this structure for the provided test cases:

- For `func_1(10, 20)`, the expected output is `(20, 10)`.
- For `func_1(15, 17)`, the expected output is `(17, 15)`.
- For `func_1(100, 200)`, the expected output is `(200, 100)`.

The function body simply returns a tuple with the elements in the required order using tuple packing. Since the function adheres to the specified behavior for all tested inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
