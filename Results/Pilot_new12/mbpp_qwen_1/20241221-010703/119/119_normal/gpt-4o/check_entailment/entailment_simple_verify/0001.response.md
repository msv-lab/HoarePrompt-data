Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The test cases provided in the assertions cover different scenarios with positive integers, and the function logic is straightforward. Since the annotations align with the problem description and the provided test cases validate the function's correctness, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
