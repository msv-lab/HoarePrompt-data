Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, swapping the values of `a` and `b` and returning them in the correct order. Since the function passes all the provided test cases and there are no edge cases or logical flaws identified, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
