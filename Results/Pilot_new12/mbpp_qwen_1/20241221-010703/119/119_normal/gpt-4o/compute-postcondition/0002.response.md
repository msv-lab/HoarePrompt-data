Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. It swaps their values and returns them in a tuple, where the first element is the original value of `b` and the second element is the original value of `a`. This means that after the function executes, the returned values will be a tuple `(b, a)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, and the code itself does not contain any missing functionality.**
