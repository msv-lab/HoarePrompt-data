#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns `b` and `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. It swaps their values and returns them in a tuple, where the first element is the original value of `b` and the second element is the original value of `a`. This means that after the function executes, the returned values will be a tuple `(b, a)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, and the code itself does not contain any missing functionality.
