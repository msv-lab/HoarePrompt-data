Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats. It swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in the order `b` followed by `a`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that need to be handled, and the code accurately performs the intended operation without any missing functionality. After the function concludes, the return values are `b` and `a`, respectively.**
