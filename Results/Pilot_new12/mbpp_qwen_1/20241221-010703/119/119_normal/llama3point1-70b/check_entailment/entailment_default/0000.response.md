Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them as a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The given code satisfies this requirement for any valid input of two numbers. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
