Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as inputs and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description, which states: "Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number." Therefore, the function always follows the problem description for every potential case of valid input.
