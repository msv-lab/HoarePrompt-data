Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1(a, b)` returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number, which perfectly aligns with the problem description. The annotated code confirms that the function simply returns `b` and then `a`, without any conditions or additional logic that might alter this behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.
