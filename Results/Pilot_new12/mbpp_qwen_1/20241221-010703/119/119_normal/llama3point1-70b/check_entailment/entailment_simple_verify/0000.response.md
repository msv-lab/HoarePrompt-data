Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers (either integers or floats) as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. This exactly matches the problem description. The original assessment concluded that the function is correct because it works as described for all tested cases and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail. The annotated version supports this conclusion by clearly showing the state of the program before and after the function execution, indicating that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program's correctness should be maintained as True.
