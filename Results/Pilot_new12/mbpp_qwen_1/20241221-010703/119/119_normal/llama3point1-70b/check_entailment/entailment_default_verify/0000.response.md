Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(a, b)` meets the problem description. The function takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the second number comes first, followed by the first number. This behavior aligns with the problem description, and the provided output hints confirm that the function accurately performs this operation for any valid inputs of integers or floats. Since there are no edge cases or logical errors identified, and the function behaves as expected, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
