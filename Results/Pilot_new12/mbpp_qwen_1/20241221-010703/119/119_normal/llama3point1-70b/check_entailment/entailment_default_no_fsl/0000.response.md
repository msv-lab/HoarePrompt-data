Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The output hints confirm that the function performs the intended operation accurately for all potential cases, assuming valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
