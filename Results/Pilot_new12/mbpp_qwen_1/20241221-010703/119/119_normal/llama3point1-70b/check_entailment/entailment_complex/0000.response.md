Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The annotated comments correctly describe the function's behavior and confirm that it accurately performs the intended operation without any missing functionality. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases or additional requirements beyond swapping the order of the inputs, the function `func_1(a, b)` fulfills all necessary conditions.
