Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in the order `b` followed by `a`. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the annotated version that would suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
