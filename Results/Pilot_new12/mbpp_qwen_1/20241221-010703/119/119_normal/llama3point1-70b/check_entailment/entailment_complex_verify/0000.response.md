Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps and returns the values of `a` and `b` in the order of `b` followed by `a`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned that the function fails to handle, and the provided annotations support that the function performs the intended operation correctly. Thus, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness is appropriate.
