Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list, returning `True` in this scenario as well. Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
