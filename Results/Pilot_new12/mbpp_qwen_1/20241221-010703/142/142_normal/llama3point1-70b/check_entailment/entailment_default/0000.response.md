Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` and checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the built-in `all()` function. This function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are `True`, which is the case if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. For an empty list, `all()` returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to `element`. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement and the output hints.
