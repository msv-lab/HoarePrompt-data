Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a generator that yields `True` for each element that matches `element` and `False` otherwise. The `all()` function returns `True` only if all values in the generator are `True`, which means all elements in the list are equal to the given element. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.
