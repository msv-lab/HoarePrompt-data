Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program implements the function `func_1` correctly according to the problem description. The function takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs and uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. 

- If all items in the list are equal to the given element, `all()` will return `True`.
- If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, `all()` will return `False`.

The function correctly handles the edge case of an empty list, returning `True` because there are no elements that do not match the given element (vacuously true).

Thus, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
