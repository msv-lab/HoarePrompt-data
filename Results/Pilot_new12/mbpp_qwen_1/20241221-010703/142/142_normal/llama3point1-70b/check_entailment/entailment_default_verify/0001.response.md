Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the provided function `func_1`. The function uses the `all()` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` ensures that `all()` returns `True` only if all elements match `element`. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases like an empty list by returning `True`, as there are no elements to contradict the condition. Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate.
