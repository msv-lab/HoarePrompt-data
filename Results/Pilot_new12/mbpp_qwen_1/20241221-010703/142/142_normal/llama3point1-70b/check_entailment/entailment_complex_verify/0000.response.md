Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

- The function uses the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (the generator expression `item == element for item in lst`) are `True`.
- For an empty list, `all([])` returns `True`, which is correct because all elements (none in this case) are equal to the given element.
- For a list where all elements are equal to the given element, the function will return `True`.
- For a list where not all elements are equal to the given element, the function will return `False`.

The annotations also confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, including the case of an empty list. Since the function behaves as expected in all scenarios described by the problem, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
