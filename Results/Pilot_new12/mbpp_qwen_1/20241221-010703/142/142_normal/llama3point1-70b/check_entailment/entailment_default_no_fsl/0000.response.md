Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty list, where `all()` will return `True` because there are no elements that do not match the `element`. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, and there is no missing functionality noted. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
