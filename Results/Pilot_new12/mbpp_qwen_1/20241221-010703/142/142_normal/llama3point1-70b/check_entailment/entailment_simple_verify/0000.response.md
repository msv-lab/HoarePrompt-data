Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function handles all edge cases, including an empty list, as explained in the original assessment. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided annotations.
