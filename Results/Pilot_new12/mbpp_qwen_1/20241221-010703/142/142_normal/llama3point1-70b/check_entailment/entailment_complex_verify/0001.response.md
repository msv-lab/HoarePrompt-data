Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all elements in the list match the given element and `False` otherwise. It also correctly notes that the function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `True`, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
