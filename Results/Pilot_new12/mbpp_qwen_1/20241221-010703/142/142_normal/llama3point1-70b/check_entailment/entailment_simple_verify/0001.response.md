Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The annotated version clearly describes the behavior of the function, stating that it returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function that checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotations do not introduce any contradictions or issues that would render the program incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
