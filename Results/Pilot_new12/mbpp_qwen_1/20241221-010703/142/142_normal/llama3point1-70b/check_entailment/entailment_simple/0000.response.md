Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs, and it uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. The `all()` function returns `True` if all items in the generator expression evaluate to `True`, which in this case means all items in the list are equal to the given element. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
