Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element using the built-in `all()` function. This function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. Given the problem description, the function will work correctly for all potential cases. Hereâ€™s a brief validation:

- For an empty list, `all([])` returns `True`, which is correct because all elements (none in this case) are equal to the given element.
- For a list where all elements are equal to the given element, the function will return `True`.
- For a list where not all elements are equal to the given element, the function will return `False`.

Since the function behaves as expected in all scenarios described by the problem, the correctness is **True**.
