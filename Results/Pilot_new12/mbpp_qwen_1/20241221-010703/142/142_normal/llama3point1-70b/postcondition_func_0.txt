The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the value `element`. If all elements match `element`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function handles edge cases such as an empty list `lst`, where it would also return `True` since there are no elements that do not match `element`. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
