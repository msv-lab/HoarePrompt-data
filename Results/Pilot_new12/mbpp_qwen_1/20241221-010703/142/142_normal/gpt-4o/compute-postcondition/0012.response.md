The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to compare against each item in the list. The function has four possible return cases, but only one of them returns `True`. In all other cases, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a value `element`, and return `True` if `element` is found in `lst`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
