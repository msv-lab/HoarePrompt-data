Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst` is a list of elements with at least 1 element.
   - The item (let's denote it as `current_item`) is not equal to the element (let's denote it as `current_element`).

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over each item in `lst`.

3. **What Happens During Each Iteration**:
   - The loop takes an item from `lst` and processes it in the loop body.
   - After processing, the next item from `lst` is taken.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more item left in `lst`.
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the list `lst` must have had at least two elements initially (one for the current iteration and one for the next iteration).

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `lst` must now have at least one less element than before because one element was processed in the previous iteration.
   - `current_item` and `current_element` will change to the next item in `lst`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- Initially, `lst` had at least one element.
- After the previous iteration, `lst` must still have at least one element remaining for the next iteration to occur.

So, the new state should reflect that `lst` has at least one element remaining and the `current_item` and `current_element` will be the next item and its corresponding value in `lst`.

**Final State**:
State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, and the item is the next element in the list, and the element is the next element in the list**.
