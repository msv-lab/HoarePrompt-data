Output State: **`lst` is an empty list or all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.** 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lst` is a list of elements.
   - `element` is a value to compare against each item in the list.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each item in `lst`.
   - For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to `element`.
   - If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **After 1 Iteration**:
   - The output state indicates that `lst` has at least one element, and that element is not equal to `element`.
   - This means that after one iteration, if the condition is met, the function will return `False`.

4. **After 2 Iterations**:
   - The output state now specifies that `lst` must have at least 2 elements.
   - The function will only return `False` if any of these elements are not equal to `element`.
   - If both elements are equal to `element`, the loop continues without returning.

5. **After 3 Iterations**:
   - Similarly, the function needs to check all three elements.
   - If any of these three elements are not equal to `element`, the function will return `False`.

6. **General Case**:
   - For the loop to complete without returning `False`, every item in `lst` must be equal to `element`.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it implies that all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.
   - If the loop returns `False` at any point, it means there is at least one item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`.
   - Therefore, the final state is that either the list is empty (which would also satisfy the condition trivially) or all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.

Hence, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `lst` is an empty list or all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.
