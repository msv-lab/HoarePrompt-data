According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one element. Additionally, the loop will assign each element in the list to the variable `item` during each iteration.

Given that the initial state mentions `lst` is a list of elements, we need to ensure that the list is non-empty for the loop to execute. The variable `element` is used for comparison within the loop but does not affect whether the loop starts or not.

Here is the required state adjustment:

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element**
