Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and checks whether `element` is present in `lst`. It iterates through each item in `lst` and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to `element`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This means that the function effectively checks if all elements in the list are identical to the given element.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `lst` is empty. In such a scenario, the function would return `True` because the condition `item != element` would never be met, but logically, an empty list should not satisfy the requirement unless all (non-existent) elements are considered to match `element`.
- The function does not account for non-hashable types in `lst`, such as lists or dictionaries, which could cause issues if they are compared using `!=`.

Final state of the program after conclusion:
- If `lst` contains all elements equal to `element`, the function returns `True`.
- If `lst` contains any element not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`.
