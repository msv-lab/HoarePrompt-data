#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value to compare against each item in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is an empty list or all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and checks whether `element` is present in `lst`. It iterates through each item in `lst` and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to `element`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This means that the function effectively checks if all elements in the list are identical to the given element.
