Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
