Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False`: The list contains elements other than 'blue', so it returns `False`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`: The list contains elements other than 7, so it returns `False`.
- `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`: All elements in the list are 'green', so it returns `True`.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
