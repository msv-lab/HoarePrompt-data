Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to check if all items in a list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. This logic aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given scenarios.
