Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the iteration without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and validate the function's behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
