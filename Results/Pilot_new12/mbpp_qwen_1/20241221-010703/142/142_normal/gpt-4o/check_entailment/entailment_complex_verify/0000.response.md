Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list `lst` and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to `element`.
2. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the list are equal to `element`.

The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False`: The list contains elements other than 'blue', so it returns `False`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`: The list contains elements other than 7, so it returns `False`.
- `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`: All elements in the list are 'green', so it returns `True`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
