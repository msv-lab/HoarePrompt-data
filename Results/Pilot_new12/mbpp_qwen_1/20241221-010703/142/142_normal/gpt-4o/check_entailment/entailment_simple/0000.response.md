Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) as inputs and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It iterates over each item in the list using a for loop.
2. For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to the given element.
3. If any item is found that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any non-matching items, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- An assert statement checking that a list with different elements does not match the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue'`).
- Another assert statement checking that a list with different elements does not match the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4], 7`).
- A third assert statement checking that a list with all elements matching the given element does match (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green'`).

Since the function behaves as expected for all these cases and the logic correctly identifies whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, the program is correct according to the problem description.
