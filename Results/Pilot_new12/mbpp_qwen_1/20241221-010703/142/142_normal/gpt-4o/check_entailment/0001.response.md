Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the iteration without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`. 

The test cases provided cover different scenarios:
1. An example where the list contains elements that are not equal to the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue'`).
2. An example where the list contains elements that are not all equal to the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4], 7`).
3. An example where all elements in the list are equal to the given element (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green'`).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic appears to handle all potential cases appropriately, the program is correct.
