Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The logic of the function is sound: it iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. The provided test cases confirm its correctness, and the output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
