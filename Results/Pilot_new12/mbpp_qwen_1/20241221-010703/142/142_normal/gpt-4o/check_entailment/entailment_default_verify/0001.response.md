Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The output hints further confirm this by stating that the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element, and only returns `True` if the loop completes without finding any mismatch. The test cases provided cover various scenarios, including lists with elements not matching the given element, lists with elements that are not all equal to the given element, and lists where all elements match the given element. Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases, the program is correct.
