Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotated version supports this by showing that the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the iteration without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and the function handles them correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
