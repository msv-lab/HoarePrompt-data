Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs. It iterates through each item in the list and checks if any item is not equal to the given element. If such an item is found, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`.

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:
- The function correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
- The function handles the case where the list contains all the same elements (returns `True`) and also the case where at least one element is different from the given element (returns `False`).

The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function:
- `assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False`: The list does not contain 'blue', so it should return `False`.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`: The list does not contain `7`, so it should return `False`.
- `assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`: All elements in the list are 'green', so it should return `True`.

Thus, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.
