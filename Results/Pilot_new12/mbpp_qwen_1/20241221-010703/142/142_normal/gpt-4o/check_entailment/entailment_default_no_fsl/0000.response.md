Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement. The given assertions also validate different scenarios, confirming that the function behaves as expected.
