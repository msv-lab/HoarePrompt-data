The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`, and checks whether `element` is present in `lst`. It iterates through each item in `lst` and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to `element`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. This means that the function effectively checks if all elements in the list are identical to the given element.
