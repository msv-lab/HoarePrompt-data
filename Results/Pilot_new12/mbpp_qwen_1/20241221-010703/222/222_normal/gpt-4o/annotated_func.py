#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string containing all uppercase characters from the original string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The function achieves this by using a list comprehension to filter out non-uppercase characters and then joining the remaining characters into a single string. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but we can infer that the function will handle an empty string by returning an empty string. If the input string contains no uppercase characters, the function will also return an empty string.
