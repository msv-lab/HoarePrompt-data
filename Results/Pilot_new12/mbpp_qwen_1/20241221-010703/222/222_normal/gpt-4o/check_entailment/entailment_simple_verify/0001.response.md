Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The test cases provided (`'PYTHon'` returns `'PYTH'`, `'FInD'` returns `'FID'`, and `'STRinG'` returns `'STRG'`) confirm that the function behaves as intended. The annotated version of the code further clarifies that the function processes the string `s` and returns a new string containing only uppercase characters. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
