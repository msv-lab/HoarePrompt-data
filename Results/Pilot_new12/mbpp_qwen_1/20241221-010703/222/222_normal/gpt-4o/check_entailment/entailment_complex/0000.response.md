Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. The annotations clearly state that the function filters out lowercase characters and keeps only the uppercase ones, which aligns with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings (characters) from a given string. 

Given the examples provided in the assertions:
- `func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'` 
- `func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`
- `func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`

These examples demonstrate that the function correctly removes lowercase characters ('o', 'n', 'i', 'n') and returns strings composed of only the uppercase characters. The function handles various cases including strings with mixed case, all uppercase, all lowercase, and even an empty string, which would result in an empty string output, as inferred from the problem description and annotations. Thus, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
