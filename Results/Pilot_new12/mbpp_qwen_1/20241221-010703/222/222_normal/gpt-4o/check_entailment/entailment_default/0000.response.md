Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it filters out lowercase characters and returns a string containing only uppercase characters. This means that if the input string contains any lowercase characters, they will not be removed, and the function will still return a string with those characters included. For example, if the input is `'PYThon'`, the expected output would be `'PYThon'` but the function returns `'PYTH'`. This behavior does not match the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings, not just lowercase characters.

To correctly implement the function, you would need to split the string into substrings and then filter out those that contain any lowercase characters. Hereâ€™s an example of how you could modify the function:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    def is_all_uppercase(sub):
        return all(char.isupper() or not char.isalpha() for char in sub)
    
    return ''.join(sub for sub in s.split() if is_all_uppercase(sub))
```

This modified function splits the string into words, checks each word to ensure it contains only uppercase characters (or non-alphabetic characters), and then joins them back together. This approach ensures that lowercase substrings are completely removed from the input string.
