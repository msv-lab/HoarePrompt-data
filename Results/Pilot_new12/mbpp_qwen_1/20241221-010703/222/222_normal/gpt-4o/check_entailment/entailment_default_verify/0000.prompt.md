You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. According to the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase letters. However, the current implementation only keeps uppercase letters and ignores any other characters such as digits or symbols. For example, if the input is `'PYTH0n!?'`, the expected output would be `'PYTH!'` but the program will return `'PYTH'` because it removes all lowercase letters and also the digit and symbol, which is not what the problem description requires.

The correct implementation should filter out all lowercase letters while preserving other characters. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This version correctly removes all lowercase letters while keeping other characters intact.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The function achieves this by using a list comprehension to filter out non-uppercase characters and then joining the remaining characters into a single string. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but we can infer that the function will handle an empty string by returning an empty string. If the input string contains no uppercase characters, the function will also return an empty string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
