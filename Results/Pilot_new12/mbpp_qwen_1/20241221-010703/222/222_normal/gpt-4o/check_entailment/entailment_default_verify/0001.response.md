Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string, keeping only the uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, filtering out lowercase characters and returning an empty string if there are no uppercase characters. The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including strings with mixed case letters, all uppercase letters, and all lowercase letters. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
