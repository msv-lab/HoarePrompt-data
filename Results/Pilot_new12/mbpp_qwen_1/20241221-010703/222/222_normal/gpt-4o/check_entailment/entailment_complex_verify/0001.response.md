Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and retains only the uppercase characters. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The provided assertions (`assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, `assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`) demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given test cases. Since the function handles an empty string by returning an empty string and does not contain any logical errors based on the problem description, the original assessment is correct.
