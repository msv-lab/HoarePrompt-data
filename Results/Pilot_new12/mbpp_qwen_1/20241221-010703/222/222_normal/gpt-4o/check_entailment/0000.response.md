Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. According to the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase letters. However, the current implementation only keeps uppercase letters and ignores any other characters such as digits or symbols. For example, if the input is `'PYTH0n!?'`, the expected output would be `'PYTH!'` but the program will return `'PYTH'` because it removes all lowercase letters and also the digit and symbol, which is not what the problem description requires.

The correct implementation should filter out all lowercase letters while preserving other characters. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This version correctly removes all lowercase letters while keeping other characters intact.
