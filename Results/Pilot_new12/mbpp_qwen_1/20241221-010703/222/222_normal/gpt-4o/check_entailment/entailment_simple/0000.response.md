Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which requires removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program removes all lowercase characters and keeps only the uppercase characters. 

For instance, if the input is `'PYTHon'`, the expected output would be `'PYTHon'` (with the lowercase 'n' removed), but the program returns `'PYTH'`. Similarly, for the inputs `'FInD'` and `'STRinG'`, the expected outputs are `'FID'` and `'STRG'` respectively, but the program returns `'FID'` and `'STRG'`.

To correctly implement the function as per the problem description, the program should iterate through each character in the string and include it in the result if it is either uppercase or not a letter (e.g., spaces or punctuation). Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper() or not char.isalpha()])

# Test cases
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'
```

With this corrected implementation, the program will properly remove all lowercase substrings from the given string.
