Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes lowercase substrings from a given string by filtering out lowercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings, which implies removing sequences of consecutive lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. 

For example:
- For the input `'PYTHonFINDSomethingLowercaseHERE'`, the expected output would be `'PYTHFINDSomethingHERE'`.
- But the current implementation will return `'PYTHFINDSomethingHERE'`, which is incorrect because it does not handle the removal of lowercase substrings as described.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
