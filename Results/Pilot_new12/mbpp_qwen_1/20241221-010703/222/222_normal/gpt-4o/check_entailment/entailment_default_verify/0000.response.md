Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` only removes lowercase letters and does not preserve any other characters such as uppercase letters, digits, or symbols. This is contrary to the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings (implying lowercase letters) from the given string. The output hints also confirm that the function currently filters out non-uppercase characters, which is not in line with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is not correct.
