Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase substrings from the given string. However, the provided code only retains uppercase characters and discards all other characters (including lowercase characters, digits, and symbols). This does not align with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. 

For example:
- Input: `'PYTH0n!?'` should produce `'0!? '` but the program will return `'PYTH'`.
- Input: `'STRinG'` should produce `'S!'` but the program will return `'STRG'`.

The annotations support this understanding, as they indicate that the function filters out non-uppercase characters. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the problem description requirements.
