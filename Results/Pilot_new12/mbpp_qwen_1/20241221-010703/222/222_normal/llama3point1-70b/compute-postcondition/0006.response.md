`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. The previous value of `result` is either the first character of `s` (uppercase) or an empty string, and `char` is the second character of `s`. Therefore, the new value of `result` will be the concatenation of its previous value with `char`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `result` is the first character of `s` (uppercase) or an empty string followed by the second character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
