Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `result` is either the first character of `s` (uppercase) or an empty string followed by the second character of `s`, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is uppercase, `result` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `result` is the second character of `s` followed by `char`.***
