The code snippet `result += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string stored in `result`. Since `char` is the first character in the string `s` and is uppercase, `result` will become the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `result` is the first character of `s` (uppercase), `char` is the first character in `s` and is uppercase.**
