State: **`s` is a string, `result` is '', `char` must be the first character in `s`**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Their Initial States**:
   - The loop variable is `char`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - Initially, `result` is an empty string (`''`).

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain at least one character.

3. **Initial State of `char`**:
   - Since the loop starts iterating from the first character, `char` must be set to the first character in `s`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the state such that `s` is a non-empty string (must contain at least one character).
   - `char` must be the first character in `s`.

Thus, the required state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`s` is a string, `result` is '', `char` must be the first character in `s`**
