Functionality: **This function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s` in the order they appear. It iterates through each character in `s`, checks if the character is uppercase, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. The function does not modify the original string `s`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string.
- The function does not handle non-string inputs; passing a non-string value will result in a TypeError.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not perform any validation to ensure that the input `s` is indeed a string. This could lead to unexpected behavior if a non-string value is passed.
