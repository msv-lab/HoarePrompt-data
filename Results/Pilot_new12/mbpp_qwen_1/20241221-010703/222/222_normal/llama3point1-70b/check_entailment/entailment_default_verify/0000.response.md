Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and retains only the uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function processes a string and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string in their original order. This aligns perfectly with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid and consistent with the program's behavior as described and hinted.
