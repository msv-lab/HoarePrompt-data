Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code removes lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just keep uppercase characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HeW", but the current implementation would return "HW". Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
