Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not meet the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided implementation instead collects only the uppercase characters from the string and removes all other characters, including lowercase ones. 

To correctly implement the function, the program should remove all lowercase characters and keep all other characters (including uppercase characters and non-alphabetic characters). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if not char.islower():
            result += char
    return result
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if each character is not a lowercase character (`not char.islower()`), and if true, it adds the character to the result. This ensures that all lowercase characters are removed, meeting the problem description.
