Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not remove lowercase substrings as required by the problem description. Instead, it only keeps uppercase characters and discards all other characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW" instead of removing all lowercase substrings like "ello". Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
