Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes lowercase substrings from a given string `s` and keeps only the uppercase characters. The function iterates through each character in the string, checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. The function does not modify the original string `s` and only includes uppercase characters, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that suggest the function behaves incorrectly. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
