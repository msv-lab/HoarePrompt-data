Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly iterates through each character of the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and if so, adds it to the `result` string. After the loop, the function returns the `result` string, which contains only the uppercase characters from the original string in their original order. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings and retain only uppercase characters. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
