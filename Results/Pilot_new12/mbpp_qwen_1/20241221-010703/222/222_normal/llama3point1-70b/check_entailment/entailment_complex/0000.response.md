Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the program instead creates a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`. This means it retains all uppercase characters and removes all lowercase characters, rather than removing lowercase substrings (which implies sequences of lowercase letters).

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output would be to remove any lowercase substring, resulting in an empty string or possibly "HW" depending on the exact interpretation of "lowercase substring". However, the current implementation results in "HW", which is not equivalent to removing a lowercase substring.

To correctly implement the problem, the function should iterate through the string and build a new string by excluding any sequences of lowercase letters. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    start_index = 0
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].islower():
            if i > 0 and s[i-1].isupper() and (i+1 == len(s) or s[i+1].islower()):
                continue
            else:
                result += s[start_index:i]
                start_index = i + 1
        elif i == len(s) - 1:
            result += s[start_index:]
    
    return result
```

This corrected version properly removes lowercase substrings by tracking the start index of segments to include in the result and skipping over lowercase sequences.
