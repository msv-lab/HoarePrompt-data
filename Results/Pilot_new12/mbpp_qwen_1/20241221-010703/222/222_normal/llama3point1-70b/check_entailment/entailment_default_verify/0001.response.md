Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program does not remove lowercase substrings; instead, it retains only the uppercase characters. This means the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is correct.
