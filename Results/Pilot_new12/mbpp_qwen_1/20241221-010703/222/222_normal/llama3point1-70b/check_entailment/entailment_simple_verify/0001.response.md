Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string. However, the provided code only retains uppercase characters and discards all other characters, including lowercase letters that are not part of any substring. The annotated version correctly describes the behavior of the program, which is to retain only uppercase characters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.
