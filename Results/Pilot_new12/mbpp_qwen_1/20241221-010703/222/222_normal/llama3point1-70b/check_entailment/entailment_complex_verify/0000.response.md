Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string `s` and retains only the uppercase characters. The function iterates through each character in the input string, checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. The final `result` string contains only the uppercase characters from the input string in their original order, which aligns perfectly with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.
