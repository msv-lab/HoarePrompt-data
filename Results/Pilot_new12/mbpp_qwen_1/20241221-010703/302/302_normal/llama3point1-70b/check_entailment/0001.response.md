Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If it finds an element equal to `num`, it returns the index. If it completes the loop without finding `num`, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function will correctly find the index of the first occurrence of `num` in the array, or return `-1` if `num` is not present. Since the function handles all cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
