Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations clearly show that the function iterates through the array and returns the index of the first match or `-1` if the number is not found. Since the function handles all potential cases as described and the annotations support this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
