Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function returns the index of `num` if found, and `-1` if not found, which matches the expected behavior. There is no evidence from the output hints or the provided code that suggests the function does not meet the problem description or has incorrect behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
