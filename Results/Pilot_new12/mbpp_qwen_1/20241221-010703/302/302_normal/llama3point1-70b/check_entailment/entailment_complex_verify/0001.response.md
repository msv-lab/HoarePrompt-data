Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations accurately describe the states of the program during execution and confirm that the function behaves as intended. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if found, or `-1` if `num` is not present in the array. There is no indication from the annotations or the original assessment that the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
