Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if found, or `-1` if not found. There are no contradictions between the code, the problem description, and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
