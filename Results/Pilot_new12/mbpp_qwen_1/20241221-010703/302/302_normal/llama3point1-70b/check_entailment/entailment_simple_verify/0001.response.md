Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` and returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number `num`. If `num` is not found, it returns `-1`. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly handles the iteration and returns the appropriate value based on whether `num` is found in `arr`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
