Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the sorted array `arr` using a for loop and checks if each element `x` equals the given number `num`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`. If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns -1. This implementation correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints. Since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the function will correctly return the index of the first occurrence of the number if it exists, or -1 if the number is not found. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
