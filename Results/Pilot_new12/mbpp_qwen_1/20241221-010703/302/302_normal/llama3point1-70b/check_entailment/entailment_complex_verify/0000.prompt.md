You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number, it immediately returns the index. If the target number is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including when the target number is not present in the array. Since no specific edge cases or examples violate the function's intended behavior, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last checked element in `arr` (or -1 if `num` is not found), and `x` is the element at index `i` in `arr`. If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns -1. Specifically:

- If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`.
- If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

This means the function can only return three distinct values: 0, 1, or -1. The provided return postconditions (Case_1: 0, Case_2: 1, Case_3: 2, Case_4: -1) do not align with the actual functionality of the function. The function will never return 2, as the only possible return values are the index of `num` if found or -1 if not found.

Additionally, the annotated code does not cover the scenario where `num` is found multiple times in `arr`. In such a case, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `num`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
