Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number, it immediately returns the index. If the target number is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including when the target number is not present in the array. Since no specific edge cases or examples violate the function's intended behavior, the program is correct.
