Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the behavior of the function. The function iterates through the array, returning the index of the first occurrence of the target number or `-1` if the number is not found. There are no edge cases or scenarios that violate the function's intended behavior as described in the problem statement. The annotations and the code itself confirm that the function meets the requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
