You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of the target number, it immediately returns the index. If the target number is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including when the target number is not present in the array. Since no specific edge cases or examples violate the function's intended behavior, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns -1. Specifically:

- If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`.
- If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

This means the function can only return three distinct values: 0, 1, or -1. The provided return postconditions (Case_1: 0, Case_2: 1, Case_3: 2, Case_4: -1) do not align with the actual functionality of the function. The function will never return 2, as the only possible return values are the index of `num` if found or -1 if not found.

Additionally, the annotated code does not cover the scenario where `num` is found multiple times in `arr`. In such a case, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `num`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
