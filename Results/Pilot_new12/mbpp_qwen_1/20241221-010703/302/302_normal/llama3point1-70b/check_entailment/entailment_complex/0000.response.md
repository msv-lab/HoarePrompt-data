Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`). If the number is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If the number is not found, the function returns `-1`.

The function iterates through the array using a `for` loop and checks each element against the target number. When a match is found, the function immediately returns the current index, ensuring that the first occurrence is returned. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns `-1`.

The problem description states that the function should return one of three distinct values: the index of the first occurrence of `num` if found, or `-1` if `num` is not found. The function adheres to this requirement and does not return any other values, such as `2`, which is mentioned in the annotations but not applicable here.

Thus, the function correctly fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description.
