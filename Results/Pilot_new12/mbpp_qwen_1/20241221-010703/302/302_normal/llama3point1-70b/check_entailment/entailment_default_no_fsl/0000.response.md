Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element, and returns the index if the value matches the given number. If the number is not found, it returns -1. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints. The function handles all potential cases correctly, ensuring that it returns the appropriate index or -1.
