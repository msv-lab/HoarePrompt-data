Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid inputs, which means the input is a sorted list (`arr`) and an integer (`num`). The program does not explicitly validate these inputs, but as per the assumption, it will handle valid inputs correctly.

2. **Algorithm Logic**: The program uses a simple iteration over the elements of the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. It checks if the current element matches the target number (`num`). If a match is found, it immediately returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `num` is found in the array, the program returns the index of its first occurrence, as required.
   - If `num` is not found in the array, the program iterates through the entire array without finding a match and finally returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Termination**: The loop terminates either when the target number is found or when all elements have been checked, ensuring that the program covers all possible cases as specified in the problem description.

Since the program correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of the given number in a sorted array and handles cases where the number is not found, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
