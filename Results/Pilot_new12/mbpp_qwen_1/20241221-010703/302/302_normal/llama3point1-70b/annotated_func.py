#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last checked element in `arr` (or -1 if `num` is not found), and `x` is the element at index `i` in `arr`. If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns -1. Specifically:

- If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`.
- If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

This means the function can only return three distinct values: 0, 1, or -1. The provided return postconditions (Case_1: 0, Case_2: 1, Case_3: 2, Case_4: -1) do not align with the actual functionality of the function. The function will never return 2, as the only possible return values are the index of `num` if found or -1 if not found.

Additionally, the annotated code does not cover the scenario where `num` is found multiple times in `arr`. In such a case, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `num`.
