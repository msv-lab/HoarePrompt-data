The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num`, which is an integer. The function returns one of the following values based on the conditions specified:

- Case_1: The program returns 0
- Case_2: The program returns 1
- Case_3: The program returns 2
- Case_4: The program returns -1

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`, and return one of four specific integer values based on certain conditions.
