Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in the list `arr`. If `x` is equal to `num`, the function returns 1. If `x` is not equal to `num`, the function continues without returning anything (implied by the absence of an else block).***
