Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer.

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which means it will access each element of the list along with its index.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no elements to iterate over.

4. **Initialization of Variables**: The loop starts with `i` as the index and `x` as the value of the element in the list at that index. Since we are starting the loop, `i` will be 0 (the first index), and `x` will be the first element in the list `arr`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: Given that the loop requires at least one element in the list, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element. Additionally, we need to specify the initial values of `i` and `x` to reflect the first iteration of the loop.

**Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in the list `arr`.**
