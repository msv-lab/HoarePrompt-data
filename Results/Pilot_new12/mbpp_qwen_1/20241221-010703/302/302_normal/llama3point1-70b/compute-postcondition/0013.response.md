Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns -1. Specifically:

- If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`.
- If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

This means the function can only return three distinct values: 0, 1, or -1. The provided return postconditions (Case_1: 0, Case_2: 1, Case_3: 2, Case_4: -1) do not align with the actual functionality of the function. The function will never return 2, as the only possible return values are the index of `num` if found or -1 if not found.

Additionally, the annotated code does not cover the scenario where `num` is found multiple times in `arr`. In such a case, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `num`.**

Edge cases:
- If `arr` is empty, the function will return -1 since `num` cannot be found.
- If `num` is the first element in `arr`, the function will return 0.
- If `num` is the last element in `arr`, the function will return the index of the last occurrence of `num`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` remains unchanged, and the function returns either the index of `num` or -1.**
