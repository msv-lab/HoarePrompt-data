According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop continues as long as there are more elements in the list `arr` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 1 element.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first element in the list `arr`.
- `x` is not equal to `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, the list `arr` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue, meaning `arr` must have at least two elements. Since `x` is the first element and is not equal to `num`, the second element `x` (when `i` is 1) should not be equal to `num` either.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
