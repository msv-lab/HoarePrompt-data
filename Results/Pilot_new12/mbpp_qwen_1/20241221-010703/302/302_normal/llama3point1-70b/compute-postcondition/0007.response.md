According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, meaning `i` is the index and `x` is the corresponding element in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the second element in the list `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. Additionally, the list `arr` must still have at least 3 elements to continue the iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in the list `arr`.**
