Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last checked element in `arr` (or -1 if `num` is not found), and `x` is the element at index `i` in `arr`. If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr` using `enumerate`.
- If `x` (the current element) equals `num`, the function returns the current index `i`.
- If `x` does not equal `num`, the loop continues to the next element.
- After all iterations, if `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`.

Given the nature of the loop and its conditions, the final state of the loop will either find `num` in `arr` and return its index, or it will complete all iterations without finding `num`, in which case it returns `-1`.
