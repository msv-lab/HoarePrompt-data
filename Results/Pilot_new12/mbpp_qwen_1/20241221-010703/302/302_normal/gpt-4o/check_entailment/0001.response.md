Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the logic inside the `while` loop has a potential issue. When `arr[mid] == target`, instead of immediately returning `mid`, it updates `result` and then sets `high = mid - 1`. This means that if there are multiple occurrences of the target number, the program will only record the last occurrence of the target number as the first occurrence. 

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
func_1([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 5)
```

The expected output should be `0` because the first occurrence of `5` is at index `0`. However, due to the current implementation, the program will return the last occurrence of `5`, which is at index `6`.

To fix this, the program should return `mid` directly when `arr[mid] == target` and avoid updating `high` to `mid - 1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            break  # Ensure we stop after finding the first occurrence
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

With this modification, the program will correctly return the index of the first occurrence of the target number.
