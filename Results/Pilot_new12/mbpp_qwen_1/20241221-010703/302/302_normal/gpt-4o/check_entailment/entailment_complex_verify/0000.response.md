Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Specifically, the line `high = mid - 1` is used when `arr[mid] == target`, which can cause the program to miss the first occurrence of the target value if there are multiple consecutive occurrences. The annotated version confirms that the program continues searching in the right half even when the target is found, which is not the intended behavior for finding the first occurrence. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the problem description.
