Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a binary search approach to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the program has a logical issue in how it updates the `high` variable. Specifically, when `arr[mid] < target`, the line `high = mid - 1` is used. This can lead to skipping over the correct index when the target value is found multiple times consecutively. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and the target `5`. The program will return the index `4` instead of `3` because it prematurely updates `high` to `mid - 1` when it encounters the first `5`, causing it to miss the subsequent occurrences of `5`.

To fix this, the update for `high` should only occur when `arr[mid] > target`, and `low` should only be updated when `arr[mid] < target`. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1  # Continue searching in the left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

With this correction, the program should correctly find the first occurrence of the target in the array.
