Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function `func_1` correctly handles the cases where the target number is present multiple times and returns the index of the first occurrence. The code also properly handles the case where the target is not found in the array, returning -1. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Given the nature of the binary search algorithm and the problem description, the code should work for every potential case within the constraints of the problem.
