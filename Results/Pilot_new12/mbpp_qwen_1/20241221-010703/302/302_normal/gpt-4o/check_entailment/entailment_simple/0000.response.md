Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. This is consistent with the problem description which states to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the target number in the array. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current search range within the array.

2. **Handling Equal Values**: When the middle element (`arr[mid]`) is equal to the target, the program sets `result` to `mid` and moves the `high` pointer down to `mid - 1`. This ensures that if there are multiple occurrences of the target, the first one is recorded and further searches continue to the left to ensure the first occurrence is found.

3. **Adjusting Search Range**: 
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, the `low` pointer is moved to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] > target`, the `high` pointer is moved to `mid - 1`.

4. **Result Assignment**: After the loop ends, `result` contains the index of the first occurrence of the target if it exists, otherwise it remains `-1`.

The program correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description. It finds the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted array and returns its index, or `-1` if the target is not found. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
