Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function `func_1` correctly handles all the examples provided and the output hints confirm its functionality. The binary search algorithm ensures that the function finds the first occurrence of the target number by continuing to search in the lower half of the array once a match is found. This approach guarantees that the function returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if the target is not found. The termination condition `low <= high` ensures that the loop runs until the target is found or the search space is exhausted. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
