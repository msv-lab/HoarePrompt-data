You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the logic inside the `while` loop has a potential issue. When `arr[mid] == target`, instead of immediately returning `mid`, it updates `result` and then sets `high = mid - 1`. This means that if there are multiple occurrences of the target number, the program will only record the last occurrence of the target number as the first occurrence. 

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
func_1([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 5)
```

The expected output should be `0` because the first occurrence of `5` is at index `0`. However, due to the current implementation, the program will return the last occurrence of `5`, which is at index `6`.

To fix this, the program should return `mid` directly when `arr[mid] == target` and avoid updating `high` to `mid - 1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            break  # Ensure we stop after finding the first occurrence
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

With this modification, the program will correctly return the index of the first occurrence of the target number.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `target` in `arr`. If the `target` is found, it sets `result` to the index of `target` and continues searching to ensure no higher index of `target` exists. If the `target` is not found, `result` remains -1. After the loop, the function returns `result`, which will be the index of the `target` if found, or -1 if not found. This covers the case where the `target` might appear multiple times in `arr` and the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If `arr` is empty, the function will return -1 as no elements can match the `target`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
