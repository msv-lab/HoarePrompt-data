Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided annotated version of the code confirms that the program does not correctly handle cases where the target value appears multiple times consecutively in the array. Specifically, the annotation indicates that after finding the first occurrence of the target, the `high` variable is updated to `mid - 1`, which can lead to skipping over other occurrences of the target. This is evident from the examples provided in the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
