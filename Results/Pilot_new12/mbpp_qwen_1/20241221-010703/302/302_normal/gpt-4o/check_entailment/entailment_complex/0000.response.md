Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to perform binary search until `low` is greater than `high`.
   - When the middle element (`arr[mid]`) matches the target, it updates `result` to the current `mid` and continues searching in the left half (`high = mid - 1`) to ensure it finds the first occurrence.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the target is not present in the array by returning `-1`.
   - It ensures that if the target appears multiple times, it returns the index of the first occurrence.

Given the provided test cases:
- `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` should return `1`, which it does.
- `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` should return `2`, which it does.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)` should return `4`, which it does.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and behaves correctly for all provided test cases, the program is correct.
