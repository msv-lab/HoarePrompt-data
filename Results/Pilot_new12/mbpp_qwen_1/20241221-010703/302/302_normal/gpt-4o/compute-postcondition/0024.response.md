`result` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `result` is equal to `mid`**
