`high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. From the initial state, we know `mid` is (`low + high`) // 2, so `high` becomes (`low + high`) // 2 - 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is the initial value, `high` is (`low + high`) // 2 - 1, `mid` is (`low + high`) // 2, `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, and `result` is equal to `mid`.**
