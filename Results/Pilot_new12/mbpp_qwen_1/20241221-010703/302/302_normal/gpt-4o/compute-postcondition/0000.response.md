The code assigns the value `0` to `low` and `len(arr) - 1` to `high`. The length of `arr` remains the same, and it is still sorted in non-decreasing order. The initial state of `arr` and `target` is unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1**
