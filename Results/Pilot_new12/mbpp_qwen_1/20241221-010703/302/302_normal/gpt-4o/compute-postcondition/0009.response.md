The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given the precondition that `arr[mid] < target`, the condition `arr[low] < target` is still valid because `low` was previously set to `mid` and now it is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `high` and `target` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `low` is now `mid + 1`
- `high` remains the same
- `mid` remains the same (it is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` in the next iteration)
- The condition `arr[mid] < target` still holds true

Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is the initial value, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`, and the current value of `mid` is such that `arr[mid] < target`**
