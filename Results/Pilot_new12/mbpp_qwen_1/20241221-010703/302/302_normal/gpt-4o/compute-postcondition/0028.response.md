Postcondition: ***`low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is set to `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and `low` remains unchanged. `mid` is always defined as `(low + high) // 2`.***
