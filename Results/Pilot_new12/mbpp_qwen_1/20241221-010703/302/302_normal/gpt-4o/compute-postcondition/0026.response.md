`low` is reassigned to the value of `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, we can express the new value of `low` as `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and the value of `mid` also remains unchanged because it is no longer referenced in the code.

Output State: **`low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is the same as before, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
