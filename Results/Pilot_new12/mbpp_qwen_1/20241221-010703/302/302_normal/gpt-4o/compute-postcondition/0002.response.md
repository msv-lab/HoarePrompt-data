Let's break down the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `result` is -1.

### Loop Condition
```
while low <= high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Since `low` starts at 0 and `high` starts at `len(arr) - 1`, the initial state already satisfies `low <= high`.

3. **No Adjustment Needed**:
   - There is no need to adjust any of the given states (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, `result`) because the initial values already satisfy the loop condition.

### Conclusion
Since the loop condition `low <= high` is already satisfied with the given initial values, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

**State:**
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
