Postcondition: **`low` is less than or equal to `high` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is set to `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and `low` remains unchanged.**
