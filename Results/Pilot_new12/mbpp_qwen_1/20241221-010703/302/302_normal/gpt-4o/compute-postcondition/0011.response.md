The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is initially `(low + high) // 2`, and no other changes are made to `low` or `high` except for setting `high` to `mid - 1`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`low` is the initial value, `high` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
