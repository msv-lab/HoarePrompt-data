Postcondition: ***`low` is either `mid + 1` or `mid` (if `arr[mid] < target`), and `high` is either `mid - 1` or remains the initial value. The element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`. After executing the if-else block, the search range for the target is narrowed down accordingly.***
