The code assigns the value `(low + high) // 2` to the variable `mid`. This operation calculates the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged, but `mid` is now assigned the result of this calculation.

Output State: **`low` is the initial value, `high` is the initial value, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
