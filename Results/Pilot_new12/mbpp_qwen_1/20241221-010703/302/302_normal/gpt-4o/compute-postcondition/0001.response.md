The code initializes the variable `result` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
