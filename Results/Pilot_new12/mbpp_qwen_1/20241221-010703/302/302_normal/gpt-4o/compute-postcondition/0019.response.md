`high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2. After the assignment, the value of `high` becomes `mid - 1`, which means `high` is now `((low + high) // 2) - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2; `high` is equal to `((low + high) // 2) - 1`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2; `high` is equal to `((low + high) // 2) - 1`**
