Postcondition: **`low` and `high` are the initial values, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, the search range for the target is narrowed down such that `low` is either `mid + 1` or `mid`, and `high` is either `mid - 1` or remains the initial value, and `arr[mid]` does not equal `target`.**
