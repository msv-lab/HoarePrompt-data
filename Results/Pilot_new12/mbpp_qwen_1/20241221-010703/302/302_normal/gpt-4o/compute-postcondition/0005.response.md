The code `result = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `result`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `arr[mid]` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`low` is the initial value, `high` is the initial value, `mid` is (`low + high`) // 2, `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, and `result` is equal to `mid`.**
