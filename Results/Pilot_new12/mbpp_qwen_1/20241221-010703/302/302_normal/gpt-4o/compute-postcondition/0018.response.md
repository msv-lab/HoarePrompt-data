`low` is reassigned the value `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2, the new value of `low` will be the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2 plus 1. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and the value of `mid` also remains unchanged because it was only used to calculate the new value of `low`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2; `low` is equal to `mid + 1`**
