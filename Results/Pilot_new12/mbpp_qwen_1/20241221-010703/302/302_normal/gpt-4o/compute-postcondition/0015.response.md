`mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`. This means `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the integer division of `(low + high)` by 2**
