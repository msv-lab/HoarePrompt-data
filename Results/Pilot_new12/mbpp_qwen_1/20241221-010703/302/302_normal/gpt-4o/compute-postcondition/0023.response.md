`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
