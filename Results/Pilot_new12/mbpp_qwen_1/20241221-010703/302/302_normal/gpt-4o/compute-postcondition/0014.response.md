Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- The initial values of `low` and `high` are the initial values.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`.
- Otherwise, the search range is narrowed down such that:
  - `low` is either `mid + 1` or `mid`.
  - `high` is either `mid - 1` or remains the initial value.
  - `arr[mid]` does not equal `target`.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must hold true. This means:

1. **`low` must be less than or equal to `high`**:
   - Since `low` and `high` are initially set to their respective initial values, we need to ensure that after the current iteration, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

2. **If `arr[mid]` does not equal `target`**:
   - Depending on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `target`, the values of `low` and `high` are updated accordingly.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is set to `mid + 1`.

Given that `arr[mid]` does not equal `target`, let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: `arr[mid] > target`
- `high` becomes `mid - 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high - 1` (since `high` is now `mid - 1`).

#### Case 2: `arr[mid] < target`
- `low` becomes `mid + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `low + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high` after the current iteration.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

### Final Answer
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`**
