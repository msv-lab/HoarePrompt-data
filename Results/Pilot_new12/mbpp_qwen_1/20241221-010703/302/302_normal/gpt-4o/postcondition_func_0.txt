The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `target` in `arr`. If the `target` is found, it sets `result` to the index of `target` and continues searching to ensure no higher index of `target` exists. If the `target` is not found, `result` remains -1. After the loop, the function returns `result`, which will be the index of the `target` if found, or -1 if not found. This covers the case where the `target` might appear multiple times in `arr` and the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If `arr` is empty, the function will return -1 as no elements can match the `target`.
