Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning. However, this approach may not work correctly if the array contains duplicate elements and the target element is not present in the array. For example, consider the following input:

```
func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
```

In this case, the function will return `-1` because the loop iterates through the entire array without finding the element `5`. Since the problem description requires the function to handle cases where the element is not present, this is a potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
