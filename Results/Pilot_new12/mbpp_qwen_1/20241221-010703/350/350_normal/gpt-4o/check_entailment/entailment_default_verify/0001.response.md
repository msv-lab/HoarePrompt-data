Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various cases including empty lists, duplicate values, and values greater than all elements in the array. The original assessment correctly notes that the function iterates through the array in reverse order, ensuring the first match found is the last occurrence of the element. The provided assertions also validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
