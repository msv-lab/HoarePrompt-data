Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first match found is the last occurrence of the element. The assertions provided in the code snippet also validate this behavior. Since the function handles the given examples correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the last position, we can conclude that the program works as expected for the described problem.
