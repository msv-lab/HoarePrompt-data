Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list, but the problem description asks for the last position of the element `x` in the sorted array. This means if there are duplicates, the function should return the index of the last occurrence, not the first.

For example, consider the following case:
- Input: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`
- Expected output: `5` (since the last occurrence of `1` is at index 5)
- Actual output: `2` (since the code returns the first occurrence from the end, which is at index 2)

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the list is empty, which would return `None`. While this is mentioned in the edge cases, the code does not explicitly check for this condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
