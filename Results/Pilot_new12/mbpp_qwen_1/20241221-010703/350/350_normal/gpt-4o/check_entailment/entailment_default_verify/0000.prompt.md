You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning. However, this approach may not work correctly if the array contains duplicate elements and the target element is not present in the array. For example, consider the following input:

```
func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
```

In this case, the function will return `-1` because the loop iterates through the entire array without finding the element `5`. Since the problem description requires the function to handle cases where the element is not present, this is a potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: This function accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It searches for the value `x` in the list `arr` starting from the end of the list. If `x` is found, it returns the index `i` of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list. If `x` is not found, it returns `None`. Specifically, the function handles the following cases:
- If `x` is found at index `i`, it returns `i`.
- If no exact match for `x` is found, it checks for the closest match before the last occurrence where `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, returning `i` in this case.
- If no such close match exists, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list `arr` in which case the function should return `None`.
- The list `arr` contains duplicate values of `x`, in which case the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` from the end.
- The value `x` is greater than all elements in `arr`, in which case the function should return `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
