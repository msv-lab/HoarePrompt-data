Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version and the problem description, the original assessment needs to be revised. The function `func_1` does indeed find the last position of an element in a sorted array, but the original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function returns the correct index. However, the function does not return the index of the last occurrence of `x` as expected; instead, it returns `-1` if `x` is not found. According to the annotations, if `x` is not found, the function should return `None`, but currently, it returns `-1`. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description, and the correct final assessment is **False**.
