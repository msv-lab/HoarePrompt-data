Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array, but it does not explicitly handle cases where the element is not present in the array. According to the output hints, if the element `x` is not found, the function should return `None`. However, the current implementation of the function returns `-1` when the element is not found, which does not align with the expected behavior as per the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being `False` is correct.
