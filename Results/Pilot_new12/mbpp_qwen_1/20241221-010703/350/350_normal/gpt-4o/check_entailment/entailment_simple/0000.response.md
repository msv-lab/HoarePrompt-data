Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates over the array `arr` in reverse order starting from the last element (index `len(arr) - 1`). This ensures that the last occurrence of `x` is found first if it exists multiple times.
2. **Return Value**:
   - If `x` is found, the function returns its index from the end of the list. For instance, in the second test case, `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` finds `1` at index 2 (from the end), so it returns `2`.
   - If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

The provided test cases also align with this behavior:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns `0` because `1` is found at index `0` (last occurrence).
- `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns `2` because the last `1` is at index `2` (counting from the end).
- `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns `3` because the last `3` is at index `3` (counting from the end).

Since the function correctly identifies the last occurrence of the specified element and handles cases where the element is not present by returning `-1`, the program is correct according to the problem description.
