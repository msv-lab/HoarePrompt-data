Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should return the index of the last occurrence of the element `x` in the array. However, the current implementation simply returns the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the array, which may not be the last occurrence if there are duplicates.

For example, consider the case where the input is `func_1([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], 2)`. The expected output would be `3` (the index of the last `2`), but the current implementation would return `1` (the index of the first `2` from the end).

To fix this, the function should continue searching after finding the first occurrence of `x` from the end until it either finds another occurrence or reaches the beginning of the array. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

This version correctly returns the last occurrence of `x` in the array.
