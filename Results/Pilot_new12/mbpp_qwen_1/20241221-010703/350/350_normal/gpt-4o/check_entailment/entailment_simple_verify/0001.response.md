Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` iterates through the array in reverse order to find the last occurrence of the element `x`. The function correctly returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` if found, and `-1` if `x` is not present in the array. The provided assertions also validate the function's behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
