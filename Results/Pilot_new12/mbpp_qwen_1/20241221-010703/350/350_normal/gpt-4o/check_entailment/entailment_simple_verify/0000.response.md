Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Although the annotated version provides additional details about the state of the program, it does not change the fundamental issue that the function `func_1` returns `-1` (or `None`) when the target element `x` is not found in the array. According to the problem description, the function should find the last position of the element in a sorted array. When `x` is not present in the array, returning `-1` indicates that the function did not find the element at all, which is consistent with the problem requirements. However, the original assessment pointed out that the function might not handle cases correctly if the array contains duplicate elements and the target element is not present, which is a valid concern. 

Given the provided test cases and the function implementation, the function does indeed return `-1` when the element is not found, which aligns with the requirement to handle such cases. Thus, the original assessment is correct, and no change is needed.
