Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `x` is an integer.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] == x:
        return i
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop starts from the last index of the list `arr` and moves backwards until it finds the first occurrence of the element `x` or finishes iterating through the list.
2. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to `x`. If so, it returns the index `i`.

### Output State after the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
- After 1 iteration: The loop either does not find `x` and continues, or finds `x` and returns immediately.
- After 2 iterations: The same logic applies, but now we know more about the state of `arr` and `x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Case 1: The Loop Finds `x`
- If the loop finds `x`, it will return the index `i` corresponding to the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list.
- At this point, `arr` remains unchanged, and `x` is still the same integer.

#### Case 2: The Loop Does Not Find `x`
- If the loop does not find `x`, it will finish its iterations without returning any value.
- In this case, `arr` remains unchanged, and `x` is still the same integer.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop finds `x`, it will return the index `i` of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list.
- If the loop does not find `x`, it will return `None`.

Given these points, the final output state is:

**Output State:**
- If the loop finds `x`, the function returns the index `i` of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list `arr`.
- If the loop does not find `x`, the function returns `None`.

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer. If the loop finds `x`, the function returns the index `i` of the first occurrence of `x` from the end of the list `arr`. If the loop does not find `x`, the function returns `None`.**
