According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `len(arr) - 1` to `0`. The loop checks each element of the list `arr` from the end to the beginning.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `x` is an integer.
- If `arr[i]` equals `x`, the function returns the index `i`.
- Otherwise, the function continues the search, ensuring that `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x`.

Let's analyze the conditions for the next iteration:

1. The loop runs in reverse order, so if `i` was the current index at the end of the last iteration, the next iteration would check `i + 1` (which would be the previous index in the forward direction).

2. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[i]` does not equal `x` and `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x`.

If we denote the current index at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then for the loop to continue, `i_prev + 1` must still be within bounds (i.e., `i_prev + 1 < len(arr)`), and `arr[i_prev + 1]` must not equal `x` and `arr[i_prev]` must not equal `x`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, if `arr[i_prev + 1]` equals `x`, the function returns the index `i_prev + 1`. Otherwise, the function continues the search ensuring that `arr[i_prev]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i_prev + 1]` is not equal to `x`.**
