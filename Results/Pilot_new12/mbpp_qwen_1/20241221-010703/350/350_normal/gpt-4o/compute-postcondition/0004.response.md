According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from the last index of the list down to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least one element.
- `x` is an integer.
- `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be decremented by 1 and must still be within the bounds of the list (i.e., `i` should be greater than or equal to 0).

Since the loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` would be `i - 1`.

So, if `i` was previously some value `k`, the next value of `i` would be `k - 1`. For the loop to continue, `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, meaning `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least one element, `x` is an integer, and `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x`**
