State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `arr`: A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `i`: The loop variable, initially set to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `x`: An integer (though its value is not relevant for the loop execution).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` because the loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = len(arr) - 1`, we need to ensure that `len(arr) - 1` is at least `0`. This means the list `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` will decrement in each iteration until it reaches `0`, so the initial value of `i` is already correct as long as `arr` is non-empty.
   - The variable `x` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so no adjustments are needed for `x`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `arr` must contain at least one element, `x` is an integer**.
