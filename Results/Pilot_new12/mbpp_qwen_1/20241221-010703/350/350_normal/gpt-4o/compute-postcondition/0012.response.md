The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x`, which is an integer. Based on the given cases, the function returns different values depending on the conditions met.

- Case_1: If `x` is found at index `i` in the list `arr`, the function returns `i`.
- Case_2: If `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the function returns `i`.
- Case_3: If `arr[i_prev + 1]` equals `x` or `arr[i_prev]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i_prev + 1]` is not equal to `x`, the function returns `i_prev + 1`.
- Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, and return the appropriate index based on the specified conditions, or return `None` if no suitable index is found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, and returns the index `i` where `x` is found in `arr`, or the index `i` such that `arr[i-1]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, or the index `i_prev + 1` where `arr[i_prev + 1]` equals `x`, or `i` where `arr[i_prev]` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i_prev + 1]` is not equal to `x`, or returns `None` if no suitable index is found.**
