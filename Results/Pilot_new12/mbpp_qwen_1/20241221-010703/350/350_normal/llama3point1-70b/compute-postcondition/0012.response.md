The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. 

- In Case_1, if there exists an index `i` in `arr` where `arr[i]` equals `target`, the function returns `i`.
- In Case_2, if no such `i` exists but the function needs to return 1, it does so.
- In Case_3, if no such `i` exists and there is an index `i` that is one less than its current value and satisfies the condition `i >= 0`, the function returns `i`.
- In Case_4, if none of the above conditions are met, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `target` if it exists; otherwise, it returns 1, then checks for an index one less than its current value that satisfies the condition `i >= 0` and returns it; if neither of these conditions are met, it returns -1.
