Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- **arr**: A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **target**: An integer.
- **For Loop**: `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Range**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `len(arr) - 1` (the last index of the list) down to `0`.
   - The step size is `-1`, meaning the loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Determining the Initial State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = len(arr) - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is valid within the bounds of the list.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(arr)` must be greater than 0. This ensures that `len(arr) - 1` is a valid index for the list `arr`.

3. **Other Considerations**:
   - The variables `arr` and `target` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might be used inside the loop body. Therefore, they don't need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to start.

### Conclusion:
The critical state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that the list `arr` is not empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least one element**.
