Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is one less than its current value and satisfies the condition `i >= 0`. If `arr[i]` equals `target`, the function returns `i`. Since there is no else part, no further changes occur in the case where `arr[i]` does not equal `target`.***
