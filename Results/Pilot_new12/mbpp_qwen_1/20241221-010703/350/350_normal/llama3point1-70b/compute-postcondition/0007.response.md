According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order starting from the last index down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the state of the variables `i` and `arr` such that the loop can potentially execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
- If `arr[i]` equals the target, the function returns 1 and exits the loop.
- If no match is found, the function will return None.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop:
- The variable `i` must be decremented by 1, meaning it must point to the previous index in the list.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be within the bounds of the list (i.e., `i >= 0`).

Given that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its current value, and `arr` remains the same.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is one less than its current value, and the condition `i >= 0` must hold.**
