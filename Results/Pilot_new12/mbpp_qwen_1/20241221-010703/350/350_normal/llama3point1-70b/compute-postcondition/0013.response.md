Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It searches the list `arr` from the end to find the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` is found, it returns the index. If `target` is not found, it returns -1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `target` is not found in the list, the function correctly returns -1 after checking the entire list from the end to the beginning.

**Summary of Final State:**
- After the function concludes, the program state is that it either returns the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `target` (if `target` is found), or it returns -1 if `target` is not present in the list.
