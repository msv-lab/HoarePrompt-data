Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - The target is not equal to `arr[i]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from the last index of the list (`len(arr) - 1`) and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is -1 (exclusive).

4. **Determining the State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop iterates backward, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be decreased by 1 from the previous value.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `1`.
   - The list `arr` remains the same since the loop body is not provided and does not modify `arr`.
   - The target remains unchanged as the condition `target != arr[i]` is not violated by the decrement of `i`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `arr` is still a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - `i` is now 1 (one less than the previous value).
   - The target remains not equal to `arr[i]`.

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is 1, and the target is not equal to `arr[i]`**.
