Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` returns the index of the first occurrence of the `target` element when searching from the end of the array. However, the provided output hints indicate that the function actually searches from the end to find the last occurrence of the `target` element. The code logic correctly implements the described functionality in the problem description, which is to find the last position of the element in a sorted array. Therefore, the original assessment should be maintained as True, but the output hints do not match the actual behavior of the function. The function correctly implements the problem description, so the final assessment is True.
