Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program correctly identifies the last position of the target element in the sorted array. However, based on the provided output hints, the function `func_1` actually finds the first occurrence of the target element from the end of the array, which is not consistent with the problem description asking for the last position of the element. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program should be marked as incorrect.
