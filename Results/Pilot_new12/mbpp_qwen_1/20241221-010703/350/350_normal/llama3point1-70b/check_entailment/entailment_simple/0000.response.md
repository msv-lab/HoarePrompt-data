Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning using a `for` loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This ensures that the last occurrence of the target element (if present) is checked first.
2. When it finds the target element (`arr[i] == target`), it immediately returns the index `i`, which is the last position of the target in the array.
3. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies the last position of the target element as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
