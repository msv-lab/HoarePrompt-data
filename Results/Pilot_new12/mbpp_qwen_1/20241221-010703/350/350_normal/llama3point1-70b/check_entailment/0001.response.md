Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the given sorted array `arr` from the end to the beginning. If it finds the `target` element, it returns its index. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the last occurrence of the target element is found, which aligns with the problem description of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Since the function correctly handles the requirement for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
