Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring that the last occurrence of the target element is found. If the target is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns `-1`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description and the provided annotations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
