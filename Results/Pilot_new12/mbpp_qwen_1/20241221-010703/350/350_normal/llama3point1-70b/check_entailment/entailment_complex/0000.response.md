Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of a given element (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning using a `for` loop. If it finds the target, it immediately returns the index. If it completes the loop without finding the target, it returns `-1`. 

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the last occurrence of the target element in the array. The problem description specifically asks for the "last position" of the element, and the code achieves this by starting the search from the end of the array. Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description for all potential cases.
