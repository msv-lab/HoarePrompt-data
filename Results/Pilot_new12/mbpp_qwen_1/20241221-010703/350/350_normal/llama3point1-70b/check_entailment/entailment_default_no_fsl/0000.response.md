Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code searches for the last position of the target element in a sorted array but starts the search from the end of the array. However, the output hints describe that the function finds the first occurrence of the target from the end, which is incorrect. The code should search for the last occurrence of the target element, not the first. For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]` and the target is `4`, the correct output should be `6` (the index of the last `4`), but the code would return `5` because it finds the first occurrence of `4` from the end. This discrepancy between the code's behavior and the description leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
