Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly iterates over the array in reverse order, starting from the last index, and returns the first index where the target element is found. This approach ensures that the function finds the last position of the target element in the sorted array. The annotation also indicates that if the target is not found, the function returns -1, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
