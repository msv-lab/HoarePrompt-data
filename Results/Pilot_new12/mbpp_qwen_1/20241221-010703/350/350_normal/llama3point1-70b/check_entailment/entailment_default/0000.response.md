Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through the given sorted array `arr` from the end to the beginning, searching for the last occurrence of the `target` element. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1. The output hints confirm that the function searches from the end of the list and returns the index of the first occurrence of the `target` from the end, which matches the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
