Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates over the array in reverse order, starting from the last index, and returns the first index where the target element is found. This correctly identifies the last position of the target element in the sorted array. Since the program handles all elements correctly without any missing logic or edge cases, it satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
