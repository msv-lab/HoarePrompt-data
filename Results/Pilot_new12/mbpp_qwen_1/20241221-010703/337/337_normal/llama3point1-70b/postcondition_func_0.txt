The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in `lst`, filtering only those integers that appear exactly once (i.e., `lst.count(i) == 1`). This means that integers appearing more than once are excluded from the sum. The function correctly handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. However, it does not handle the case where `lst` contains non-integer values, which would raise a `TypeError` during the `lst.count(i)` operation.
