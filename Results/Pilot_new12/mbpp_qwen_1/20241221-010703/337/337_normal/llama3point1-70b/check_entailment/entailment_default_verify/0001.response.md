Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, it fails to address a critical aspect mentioned in the output hints. Specifically, the function does not handle non-integer values in the list, which would raise a `TypeError` during the `lst.count(i)` operation. Since the problem description does not specify that the input list will only contain integers, the function's behavior under these circumstances is undefined and incorrect. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
