Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. The program correctly identifies non-repeated elements in the list by using the condition `lst.count(i) == 1` within the generator expression. It then sums these unique elements using the `sum()` function. The annotations clarify that the program returns the sum of unique integers in the list `lst`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
