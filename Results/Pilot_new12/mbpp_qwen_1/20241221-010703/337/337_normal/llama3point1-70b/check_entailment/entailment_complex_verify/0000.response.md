Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` filters out repeated elements, and `sum()` computes the sum of the remaining unique elements. The annotated version also mentions that the function correctly handles an empty list by returning 0. Although the annotated version points out that the function does not handle non-integer values in the list, this is outside the scope of the original problem description, which specifies that the input will be a list of integers. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the behavior of the function as described by the annotations, the program is correct.
