Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of the non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in `lst`, filtering only those integers that appear exactly once (`lst.count(i) == 1`). This ensures that the sum returned is only of the non-repeated elements. The function also handles the edge case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. Since the problem description specifies that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the function does not need to handle invalid inputs, making it fully compliant with the given requirements.
