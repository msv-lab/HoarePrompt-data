Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any list where elements are repeated, the function will only include the unique elements in the sum, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (as far as can be determined without additional specific edge cases), the program is correct.
