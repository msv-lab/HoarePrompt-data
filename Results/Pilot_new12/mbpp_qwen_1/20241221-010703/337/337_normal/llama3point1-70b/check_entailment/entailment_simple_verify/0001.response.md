Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the list, counts the occurrences of each element, and includes only those elements that appear exactly once in the sum. The function behaves as expected according to the problem description, and the annotations support this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
