Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list of integers. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in `lst`, filtering only those integers that appear exactly once. This approach ensures that only unique elements contribute to the sum. The function also correctly handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle non-integer values in the list, which could raise a `TypeError`, the original problem description assumes valid input, and we are instructed to focus on the provided code and annotations. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the given assumptions.
