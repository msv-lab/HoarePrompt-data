Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment states that the program is correct, it fails to account for the case where the input list contains non-integer values. The function `func_1` uses `lst.count(i)` which will raise a `TypeError` if `lst` contains non-integer elements. According to the output hints, the program does not handle this case, making it incorrect as per the problem description which implies the input list should contain integers. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because it overlooks this important validation aspect.
