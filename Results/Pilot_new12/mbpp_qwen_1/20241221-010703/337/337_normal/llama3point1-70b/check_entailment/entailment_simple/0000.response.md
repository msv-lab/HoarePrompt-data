Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:
1. It uses a generator expression `i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1` to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst` and include it in the sum only if `lst.count(i)` equals 1. This condition ensures that only unique elements are considered.
2. The `sum` function then calculates the sum of these unique elements.

Since the function correctly identifies and sums up all non-repeated elements in the list, it adheres to the problem description.
