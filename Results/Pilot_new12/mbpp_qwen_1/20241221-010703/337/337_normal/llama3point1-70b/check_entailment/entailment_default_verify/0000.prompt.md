You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's a reasoning for why it works in all cases:

1. **Generating Non-Repeated Elements**: The generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` iterates through each element in the list and includes it only if it appears exactly once in the list. This ensures that only non-repeated elements are included in the summation.

2. **Summing the Elements**: The `sum()` function then adds up these non-repeated elements, which gives the desired result.

To further validate this, let's consider a few test cases:
- For `lst = [4, 5, 6, 7, 4]`, the non-repeated elements are `[5, 6, 7]` and their sum is `18`.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, the non-repeated elements are `[4, 5]` and their sum is `9`.

In both cases, the program works as expected. Since we cannot find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, we conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in `lst`, filtering only those integers that appear exactly once (i.e., `lst.count(i) == 1`). This means that integers appearing more than once are excluded from the sum. The function correctly handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. However, it does not handle the case where `lst` contains non-integer values, which would raise a `TypeError` during the `lst.count(i)` operation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
