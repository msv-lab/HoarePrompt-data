Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`, filtering only those integers that appear exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`. This ensures that the sum returned is only of the non-repeated elements in the list. The program handles the case where the list might be empty by returning 0, which is correct according to the problem description. There are no other potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would cause the program to fail, and the program does not need to handle non-integer values as per the problem description assumption that valid input will be provided. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case.
