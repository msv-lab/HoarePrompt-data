Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains non-integer values. According to the output hints, if the list contains non-integer values, the `lst.count(i)` operation will raise a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case as specified in the problem description.
