Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's a reasoning for why it works in all cases:

1. **Generating Non-Repeated Elements**: The generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` iterates through each element in the list and includes it only if it appears exactly once in the list. This ensures that only non-repeated elements are included in the summation.

2. **Summing the Elements**: The `sum()` function then adds up these non-repeated elements, which gives the desired result.

To further validate this, let's consider a few test cases:
- For `lst = [4, 5, 6, 7, 4]`, the non-repeated elements are `[5, 6, 7]` and their sum is `18`.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, the non-repeated elements are `[4, 5]` and their sum is `9`.

In both cases, the program works as expected. Since we cannot find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, we conclude that the program is correct.
