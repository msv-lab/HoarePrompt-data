Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. It achieves this by first converting the list into a set to remove duplicates, then calculates the sum of the elements in the set. This process ensures that each integer is only counted once in the final sum. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a sum of 0, and a list containing non-integer values, which would raise a `TypeError`.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the handling of edge cases such as an empty list and non-integer values, which could potentially cause issues if not addressed.
