Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The use of `set(lst)` ensures that only unique elements are considered, and the `sum()` function correctly computes their total. The provided test cases demonstrate that the program works as intended, and the annotations clarify that the program handles the input correctly by converting the list to a set and summing the unique elements. No issues or edge cases have been identified that would cause the program to fail under the given constraints.
