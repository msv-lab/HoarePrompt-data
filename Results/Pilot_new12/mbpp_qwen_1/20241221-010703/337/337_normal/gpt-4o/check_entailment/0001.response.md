Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `sum` function combined with `set` to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicates, and then summing the set gives the sum of unique elements. The assertions provided also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the function handles the logic correctly and the provided test cases do not reveal any issues, we can conclude that the program is correct for the described problem.
