Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of unique elements in the list using `sum(set(lst))`. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. The examples provided in the original assessment demonstrate that the function works as intended for various cases, including handling duplicates and empty lists (which would return a sum of 0). Since the program handles the expected functionality correctly and there are no assumptions or unsupported changes needed, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
