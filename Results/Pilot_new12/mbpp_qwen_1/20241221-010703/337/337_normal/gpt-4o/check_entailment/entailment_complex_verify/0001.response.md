Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list by converting the list to a set to remove duplicates and then summing the elements. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. The annotated version further clarifies the process, stating that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. There are no issues with the provided code or the problem description that would lead to a different conclusion.
