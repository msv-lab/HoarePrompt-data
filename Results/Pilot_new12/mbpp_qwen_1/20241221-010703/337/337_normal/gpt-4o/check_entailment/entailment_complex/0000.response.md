Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated (unique) elements in that list. This is achieved by converting the list to a set, which inherently removes any duplicate elements, and then calculating the sum of the elements in the set. 

Given the constraints and assumptions mentioned (i.e., valid input without causing errors), the program correctly sums up all unique elements. Therefore, it satisfies the problem description for all potential cases within these constraints.
