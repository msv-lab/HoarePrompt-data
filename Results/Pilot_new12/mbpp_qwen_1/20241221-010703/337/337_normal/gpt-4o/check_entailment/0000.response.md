Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses `sum(set(lst))` to calculate the sum of unique elements in the list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicate elements, and then summing the set gives the sum of non-repeated elements. Given the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns 21, which is the sum of unique elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
2. `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns 71, which is the sum of unique elements: 1 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 2 + 45 + 4.
3. `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns 78, which is the sum of unique elements: 12 + 10 + 9 + 45 + 2.

The program correctly handles the provided examples and does not miss any unique elements or include duplicates. Since no potential edge cases or inputs were identified that would cause the program to fail, we can conclude that the program is correct.
