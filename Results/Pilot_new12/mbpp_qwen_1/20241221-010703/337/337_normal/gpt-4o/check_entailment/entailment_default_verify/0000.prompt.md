You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses `sum(set(lst))` to calculate the sum of unique elements in the list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicate elements, and then summing the set gives the sum of non-repeated elements. Given the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns 21, which is the sum of unique elements: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
2. `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns 71, which is the sum of unique elements: 1 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 2 + 45 + 4.
3. `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns 78, which is the sum of unique elements: 12 + 10 + 9 + 45 + 2.

The program correctly handles the provided examples and does not miss any unique elements or include duplicates. Since no potential edge cases or inputs were identified that would cause the program to fail, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. It achieves this by first converting the list into a set to remove duplicates, then calculates the sum of the elements in the set. This process ensures that each integer is only counted once in the final sum. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a sum of 0, and a list containing non-integer values, which would raise a `TypeError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
