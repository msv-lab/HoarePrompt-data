Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list using the approach of converting the list to a set and then summing the set. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])`, the unique elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and their sum is 21.
2. For `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])`, the unique elements are 1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45, and their sum is 71.
3. For `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])`, the unique elements are 12, 10, 9, 45, 2, and their sum is 78.

The annotated version confirms that the function takes a list as input, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and then sums the elements of the set. There are no discrepancies between the problem description and the program's behavior, so the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
