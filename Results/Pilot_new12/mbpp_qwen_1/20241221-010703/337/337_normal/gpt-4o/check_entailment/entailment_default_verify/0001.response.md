Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `sum` function combined with `set` to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The output hints also support this, noting that the function converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then sums the unique elements. The hints also mention potential edge cases such as an empty list resulting in a sum of 0, which is handled correctly by the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
