Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, converts it to a set to remove any duplicate elements, and then calculates the sum of the unique elements using the `sum` function. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program and the operations performed, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
