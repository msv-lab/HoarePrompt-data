Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a set to remove duplicate elements from the input list and then calculates the sum of the remaining unique elements. The assertions provided cover various scenarios, including lists with repeated elements and lists with multiple unique elements. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code handles the conversion to a set and sum calculation accurately. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code fails to address under the given assumptions. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case as per the problem description.
