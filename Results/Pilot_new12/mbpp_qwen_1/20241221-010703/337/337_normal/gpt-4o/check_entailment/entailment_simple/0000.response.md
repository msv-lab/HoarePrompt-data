Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. This is achieved by converting the list to a set using `set(lst)`, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then taking the sum of the resulting set using `sum(set(lst))`.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and their sum is `21`.
- For the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the non-repeated elements are `[1, 9, 4, 2, 45]` and their sum is `71`.
- For the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the non-repeated elements are `[12, 9, 45, 2]` and their sum is `78`.

Since the program correctly sums the non-repeated elements of the input list and the test cases validate this behavior, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
