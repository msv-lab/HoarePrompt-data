Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It converts the list into a set to remove duplicates and then sums the elements in the set. Given the assertions provided, the function works correctly for the examples given. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function returns the sum of unique integers from the list, which aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle, such as an empty list or non-integer values, as these are not required according to the problem description. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case within the given constraints.
