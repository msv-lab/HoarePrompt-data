#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of unique integers from the list. It achieves this by first converting the list into a set to remove duplicates, then calculates the sum of the elements in the set. This process ensures that each integer is only counted once in the final sum. Potential edge cases include an empty list, which would result in a sum of 0, and a list containing non-integer values, which would raise a `TypeError`.
