The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length containing numerical values, and return a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, both tuples of the same length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.**
