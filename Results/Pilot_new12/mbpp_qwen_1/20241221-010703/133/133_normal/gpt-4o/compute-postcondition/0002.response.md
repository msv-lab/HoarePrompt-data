Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, both tuples of the same length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function ensures that both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle cases where the tuples contain non-numerical values; in such cases, it will raise a TypeError.**

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length. If they are not, the function will raise a ValueError due to the use of `zip`.
- The function does not validate the types of elements within the tuples. If any element is not a numerical value (e.g., string), a TypeError will be raised.
- The function does not handle other exceptions that might occur during the execution, such as unexpected errors in the tuple operations.
