The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, both tuples of the same length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function ensures that both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle cases where the tuples contain non-numerical values; in such cases, it will raise a TypeError.
