Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of two tuples. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of the same length containing numerical values and returns a tuple with the differences. Although the function does not explicitly handle cases where the tuples contain non-numerical values, this is noted in the output hints and does not invalidate the correctness of the function for the given problem description and test cases. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
