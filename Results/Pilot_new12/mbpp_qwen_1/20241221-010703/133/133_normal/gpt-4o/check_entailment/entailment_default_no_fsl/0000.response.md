Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the function `func_1` which takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. The code uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction operation. The assertions in the code verify that the function works correctly for the given examples, and there are no indications in the problem description or output hints that suggest the function does not handle other valid cases. Since the function correctly handles the examples provided and follows the problem description for the given inputs, the correctness is **True**.
