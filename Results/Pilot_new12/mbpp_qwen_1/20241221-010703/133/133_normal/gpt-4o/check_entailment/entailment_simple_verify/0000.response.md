Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of two tuples. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The assertions provided in the example test cases correctly validate the function for the given inputs. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the implementation logically handles the subtraction operation for tuples of equal length, we can maintain the original assessment that the function is correct for the described problem.
