Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly performs the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The provided test cases in the form of assertions also demonstrate that the function works as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
