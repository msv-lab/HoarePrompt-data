Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly performs the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples of the same length. The annotations confirm that the function handles tuples of numerical values and returns a tuple of differences. The provided test cases in the form of assertions validate the function's correctness. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle cases where the tuples contain non-numerical values, which could lead to a `TypeError`, this is not addressed in the problem description. Given the assumption that the inputs will be valid, the original assessment remains valid. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
