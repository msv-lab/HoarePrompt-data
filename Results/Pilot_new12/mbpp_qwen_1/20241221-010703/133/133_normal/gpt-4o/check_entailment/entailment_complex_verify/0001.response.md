Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor, ensuring that the result is a tuple containing the differences. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle cases where the tuples contain non-numerical values, the original assessment is still correct because the problem description does not specify handling such cases, and the function will indeed raise a `TypeError` if non-numerical values are provided. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
