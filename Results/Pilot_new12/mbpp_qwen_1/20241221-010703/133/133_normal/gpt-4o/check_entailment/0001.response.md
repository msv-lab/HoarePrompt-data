Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction, which ensures that the result is a tuple containing the differences. All the provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since there are no obvious edge cases or errors in the logic, and the function passes the given assertions, the program is correct for the described problem.
