Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function takes two tuples as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from the second tuple from the corresponding element in the first tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
- The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple.
- The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function pairs up the elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their indices.
- For each pair `(a, b)`, the expression `a - b` calculates the difference.
- These differences are collected into a new tuple, which is returned by the function.

The provided assertions check different cases:
1. `(10, 4, 5) - (2, 5, 18) = (8, -1, -13)`
2. `(11, 2, 3) - (24, 45, 16) = (-13, -43, -13)`
3. `(7, 18, 9) - (10, 11, 12) = (-3, 7, -3)`

In all cases, the function performs the subtraction correctly, and the results match the expected output. Since the function behaves as specified for the given test cases and there are no additional constraints or special cases mentioned in the problem description, the program is correct.
