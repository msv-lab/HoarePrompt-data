Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. The provided function subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple and returns the result as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling tuples of the same length and numerical values. While the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-numerical values (which would raise a `TypeError`), this is not an issue given the problem description specifies numerical values and the input is assumed to be valid. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
