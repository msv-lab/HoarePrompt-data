Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction operation efficiently. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description does not specify any validation for the input tuples other than ensuring they are of the same length. The function `zip(tup1, tup2)` inherently requires that both tuples are of the same length, so no additional validation is needed.

2. **Operation Performed**: The function correctly performs the subtraction of corresponding elements as described in the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**: The function returns a tuple, which is consistent with the expected output format.

Since the function meets all the criteria specified in the problem description without any additional constraints or assumptions beyond those provided, the program is correct.
