Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of two tuples. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements from the input tuples. The assertions provided in the example test cases correctly validate the function for the given inputs. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the implementation logically handles the subtraction operation for tuples of equal length, we can conclude that the function is correct for the described problem.
