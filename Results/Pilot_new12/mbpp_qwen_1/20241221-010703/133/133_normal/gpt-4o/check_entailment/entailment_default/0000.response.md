Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor to achieve this, ensuring that each element in the resulting tuple is the difference between the corresponding elements of the input tuples. The function also handles tuples of the same length and numerical values correctly, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The function does not explicitly handle non-numerical values or empty tuples, but these are outside the scope of the problem description, which only specifies valid inputs. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
