Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly performs element-wise subtraction of the second tuple from the first tuple, provided both tuples are of the same length and contain numeric values. The annotation explicitly states that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric values before the function call, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
