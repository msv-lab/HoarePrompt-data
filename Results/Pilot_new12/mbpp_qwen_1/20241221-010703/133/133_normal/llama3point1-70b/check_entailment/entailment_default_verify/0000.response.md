Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously and applies the subtraction operation. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction element-wise. While the function does not explicitly handle the case of unequal tuple lengths, the problem description does not specify how the function should behave in such cases. Therefore, based on the provided information, the function meets the problem description and is correct.
