Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `tuple()` function, which iterates over pairs of elements from both tuples (obtained via `zip(tup1, tup2)`) and performs the subtraction. Since the program handles the input as required (both tuples must be of the same length and contain numeric values), and it produces the correct output for all valid cases, it satisfies the problem description.
