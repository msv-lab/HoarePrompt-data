Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of the second tuple from the first tuple. The code uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to perform this operation. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of equal length and raises a `ValueError` if the lengths differ, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the problem description does not specify handling cases where the input tuples have different lengths beyond raising a `ValueError`, and the code adheres to this requirement, the program is correct.
