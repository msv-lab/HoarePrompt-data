Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously and applies the subtraction operation. This approach works for tuples of any length as long as they have the same length. Since the function handles the operation as described and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this function fails to handle, the program is correct.
