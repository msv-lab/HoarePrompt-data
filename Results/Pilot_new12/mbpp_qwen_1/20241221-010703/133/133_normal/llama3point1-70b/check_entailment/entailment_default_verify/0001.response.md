Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The function uses `zip` to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction element-wise. Although the function does not explicitly handle the case where tuples have different lengths (raising a `ValueError` instead), this aligns with the assumption that the input will always be valid as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
