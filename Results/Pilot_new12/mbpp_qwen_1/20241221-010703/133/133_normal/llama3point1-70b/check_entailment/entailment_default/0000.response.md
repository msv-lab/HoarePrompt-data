Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input, which are expected to be of the same length. It then subtracts the elements of `tup2` from `tup1` element-wise and returns a new tuple with the results. The use of the `zip` function ensures that the subtraction is performed for corresponding elements of both tuples, and the generator expression within the tuple comprehension achieves the desired result. The program handles tuples of equal length correctly, and while it does not explicitly handle the case where the tuples are of unequal length, the problem description does not specify what should happen in such cases. Therefore, assuming the inputs are valid and of the same length, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
