Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The annotated version confirms that the function handles tuples of the same length and performs the subtraction operation as required. Although the annotated version mentions that no edge cases are explicitly handled for unequal lengths, the original problem description did not specify handling such cases. Therefore, the function's behavior as demonstrated in the annotated version aligns with the problem description, making the original assessment correct.
