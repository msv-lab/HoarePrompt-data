Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. Specifically:

- It accepts two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as inputs.
- Both tuples are expected to contain numeric values and be of the same length.
- The function uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to perform element-wise subtraction of `tup2` from `tup1`.
- The resulting tuple contains the differences between corresponding elements of the two input tuples.

The program adheres to the problem description in all aspects. It performs the subtraction operation as required and handles tuples of the same length appropriately. Since the problem description assumes valid inputs (same length tuples), the program meets the criteria specified without needing to handle edge cases like different lengths explicitly, which is consistent with the provided assumptions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
