Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. Given the problem description, the function uses `zip` to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases where both tuples are of the same length and contain numerical values, it meets the requirements described in the problem statement.
