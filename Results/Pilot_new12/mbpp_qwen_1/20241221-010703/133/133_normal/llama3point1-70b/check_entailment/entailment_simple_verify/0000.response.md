Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly performs the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple (`tup2`) from the corresponding elements of the first tuple (`tup1`). The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously and applies the subtraction operation. The annotated code clearly shows that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the subtraction. Since the function handles the operation as described and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this function fails to handle, the program is correct.
