Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numeric values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction element-wise. If the tuples have different lengths, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function stopping when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function for unequal lengths, so it is assumed that the input tuples are of the same length.**
