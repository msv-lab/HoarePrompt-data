Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_31_days` which contains the integers representing the months that have 31 days (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). It then checks if the input `month` is in this set. If the `month` is in the set, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected:
- For month 5, it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 2, it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 6, it returns `False` (correct).
- For month 1, it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 12, it returns `True` (correct).
- For month 11, it returns `False` (correct).

Since the function accurately determines whether a given month has 31 days based on the provided problem description, the program is correct.
