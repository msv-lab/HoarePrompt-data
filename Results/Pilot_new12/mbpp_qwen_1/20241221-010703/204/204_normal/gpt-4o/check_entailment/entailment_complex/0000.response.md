Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`, and checks whether the given month corresponds to a month with 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` contains the integers representing the months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function returns `True` if the input `month` is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases in the form of assertions cover all the months with 31 days and all the other months, confirming that the function behaves as expected for all possible valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
