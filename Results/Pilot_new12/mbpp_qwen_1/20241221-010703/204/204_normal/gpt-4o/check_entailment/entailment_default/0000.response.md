Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` uses a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), and it returns `True` if the input month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The assertions provided in the problem description cover all the potential cases for month numbers (1 through 12), and the function returns the correct output for each case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
