Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the numbers of months that have 31 days (1 for January, 3 for March, 5 for May, etc.). It then returns whether the given month is in this set.

The provided test cases cover several months with and without 31 days, and the function passes all these tests. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that the current implementation misses. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided test cases, the function is correct.
