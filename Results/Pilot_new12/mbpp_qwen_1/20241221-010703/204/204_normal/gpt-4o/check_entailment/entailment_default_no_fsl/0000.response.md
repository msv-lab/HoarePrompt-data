Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check whether a given month number contains 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` contains the numbers of the months that have 31 days (1 for January, 3 for March, 5 for May, 7 for July, 8 for August, 10 for October, and 12 for December). The function `func_1` returns `True` if the input month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases cover all the months with 31 days and those without, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the specified range (1 to 12).
