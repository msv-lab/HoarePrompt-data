Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The annotated version supports this by explaining that the function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided in the assertions cover all the relevant month numbers from 1 to 12, and the function handles these cases correctly without any issues. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
