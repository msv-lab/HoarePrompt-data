Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the numbers of months that have 31 days. It returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases cover several months with and without 31 days, and the function passes all these tests. The annotations align with the original assessment, indicating that the function behaves as expected and there are no edge cases or logical errors present. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
