Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` for months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for those without (2, 4, 6, 9, 11). Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
