Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. Based on the problem description, this function works correctly for the provided test cases and handles all the potential cases for month numbers (1 through 12). Therefore, the program is correct.
