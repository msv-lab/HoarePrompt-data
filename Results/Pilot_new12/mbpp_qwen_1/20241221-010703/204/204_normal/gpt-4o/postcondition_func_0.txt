The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (i.e., January, March, May, July, August, October, December). If the month meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need to be handled separately, as the code correctly implements the intended logic.
