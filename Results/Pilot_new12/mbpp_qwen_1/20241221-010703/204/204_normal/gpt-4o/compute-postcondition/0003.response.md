Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (i.e., January, March, May, July, August, October, December). If the month meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need to be handled separately, as the code correctly implements the intended logic.**

This summary captures the essence of the function's behavior as described by both the annotated code and the return postconditions, ensuring all potential cases are covered based on the provided information.
