#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if month is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (i.e., January, March, May, July, August, October, December). If the month meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need to be handled separately, as the code correctly implements the intended logic.
