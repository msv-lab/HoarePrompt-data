Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by verifying if the month number is in the list of months with 31 days. The annotated version confirms that the function handles all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, inclusive, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the input month has 31 days. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
