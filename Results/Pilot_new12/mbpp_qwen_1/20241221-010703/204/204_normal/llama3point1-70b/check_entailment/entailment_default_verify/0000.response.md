Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by comparing the input month number against a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs within the range of 1 to 12. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
