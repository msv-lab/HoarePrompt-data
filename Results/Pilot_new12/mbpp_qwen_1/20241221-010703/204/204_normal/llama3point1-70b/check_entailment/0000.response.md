Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number is in this list, and `False` otherwise. This implementation covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Since the function works correctly for all valid month numbers (1 through 12), and it handles the requirement accurately, the program is correct.
