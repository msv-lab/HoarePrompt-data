Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12) and checks whether `n` is in the list of months that contain 31 days. The list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]` accurately represents the months with 31 days. If `n` is found in this list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the month does not have 31 days. The program correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 12, inclusive) and does not include any unnecessary or incorrect logic. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
