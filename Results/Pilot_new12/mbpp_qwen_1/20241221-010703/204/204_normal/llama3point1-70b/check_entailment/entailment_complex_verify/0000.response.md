Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by using a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if the input month number is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, and `False` otherwise. Since the function handles all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, inclusive, and no additional functionality or edge cases are present in the provided code, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
