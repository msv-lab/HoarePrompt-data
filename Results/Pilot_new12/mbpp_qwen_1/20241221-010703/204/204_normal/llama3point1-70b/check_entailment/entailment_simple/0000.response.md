Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given month number `n` (where `1 <= n <= 12`) contains 31 days. The program uses a list `months_31_days` which contains the integers corresponding to the months that have 31 days. By checking if `n` is in this list, the function accurately determines whether the month has 31 days. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs within the specified range.
