Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by verifying if the month number is in the list of months with 31 days. The output hints confirm that the function handles all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, inclusive, and behaves as expected. Since the problem description asks to check whether the given month number contains 31 days, and the function `func_1` performs this task correctly, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
