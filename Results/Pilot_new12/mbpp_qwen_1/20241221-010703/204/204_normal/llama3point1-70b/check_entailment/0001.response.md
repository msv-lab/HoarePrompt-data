Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 31 days by seeing if the number is in the list `months_31_days`, which correctly includes the month numbers (1 for January, 3 for March, etc.) that have 31 days. Since the function behaves as expected for all month numbers, and the problem description only requires checking if a given month has 31 days, this implementation is correct.
