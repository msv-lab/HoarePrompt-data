Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a list `months_31_days` containing the indices of months that have 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). It returns `True` if the given month number `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise. Given that the problem description asks to check if a month number contains 31 days, and the function correctly implements this logic for all valid month numbers (1 through 12), the function works as expected for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
