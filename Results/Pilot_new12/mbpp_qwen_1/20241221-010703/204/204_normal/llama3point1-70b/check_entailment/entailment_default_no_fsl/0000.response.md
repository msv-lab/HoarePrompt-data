Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a list `months_31_days` that includes all the months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and returns `True` if the input `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. The function handles all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, inclusive, as specified in the problem description. There are no additional cases or functionalities needed as per the output hints. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
