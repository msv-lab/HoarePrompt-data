Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks if a given month number `n` is in the list `months_31_days`, which correctly identifies the months with 31 days. The function returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. The annotations provide further clarity on the state of the program and the expected behavior, reinforcing the correctness of the original assessment.
