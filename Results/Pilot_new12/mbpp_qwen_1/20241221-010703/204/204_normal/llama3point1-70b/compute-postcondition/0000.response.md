The code creates a list `months_31_days` containing integers. This list does not affect the value of `n`, which remains an integer representing a month number between 1 and 12. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `months_31_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12; `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
