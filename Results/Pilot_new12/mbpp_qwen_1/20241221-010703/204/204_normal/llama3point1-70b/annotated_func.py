#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if n is in the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12). It checks whether `n` is in the list of months with 31 days, which includes January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). If `n` is one of these months, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12, inclusive. No additional functionality or edge cases are present in the provided code.
