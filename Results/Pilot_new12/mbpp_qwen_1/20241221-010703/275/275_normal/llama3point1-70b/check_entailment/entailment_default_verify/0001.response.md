Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning 0, and it uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the largest subset size. The output hints also support this, indicating that the function correctly processes the input list, sorts it, and uses a DP approach to determine the largest subset size. There is no indication in the provided information that suggests the function has any logical errors or misses edge cases. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
