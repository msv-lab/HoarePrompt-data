Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description. The function `func_1` aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair of numbers is divisible by each other. The code correctly implements this by sorting the list and using dynamic programming to keep track of the longest chain of divisible numbers ending at each index. The inner loop checks all previous elements to find the longest chain, updating the `dp` list accordingly. The final result is the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset meeting the criteria. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code handles all potential cases as required.
