Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(nums)` aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by each other. Here's why the provided solution is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Base Case Handling**: 
   - The function correctly handles the base case where the input list `nums` is empty. It returns `0`, which is appropriate as there would be no valid subset.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in efficiently determining the divisibility relationships between elements.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A dynamic programming (DP) approach is used where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that can be formed from the first `i+1` elements of `nums` such that every pair in the subset is divisible by each other.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, the function checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which corresponds to the size of the largest subset satisfying the divisibility condition.

Given these points, the provided implementation correctly solves the problem as described. It ensures that every number in the resulting subset divides the next one, and it finds the maximum such subset size. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
