Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the largest subset of a list of integers where every pair of elements is divisible.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - **Base Case**: If the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns `0`, which correctly handles the edge case.
   - **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in efficiently checking divisibility between pairs of elements.
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: A DP array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. For each element `nums[i]`, the program checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, the value `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - **Result**: The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which gives the size of the largest subset satisfying the divisibility condition.

The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that for every element `nums[i]`, it considers all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to determine if they can form part of the largest subset. By using sorting and dynamic programming, the program ensures that the solution is optimal and efficient.

Therefore, the program is correct as it accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem as described.
