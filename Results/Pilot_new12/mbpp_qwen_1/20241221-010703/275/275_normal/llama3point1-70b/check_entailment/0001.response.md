Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The function sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. For each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they can form a valid subset. Given the problem description and the provided code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases.
