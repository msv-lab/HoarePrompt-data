Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. The code uses dynamic programming to keep track of the longest chain of divisors ending at each element. The logic seems correct based on the problem description and the output hints. For each element in the sorted list, it checks all previous elements to find the longest chain of divisors ending at the current element. The final result is obtained by finding the maximum value in the `dp` list. Given the nature of the problem and the provided implementation, the code appears to cover all necessary cases and produce the correct output for the described problem.
