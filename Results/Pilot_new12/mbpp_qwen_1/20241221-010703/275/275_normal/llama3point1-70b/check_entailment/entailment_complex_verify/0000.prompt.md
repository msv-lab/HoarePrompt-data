You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list and using dynamic programming to find the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. However, this approach has a flaw. Consider the following input:

Input: `[2, 4, 8, 16]`

Expected output: `4` (the entire list is the largest subset where every pair is divisible).

The program's output for this input is also `4`, which seems correct. However, consider another input:

Input: `[2, 4, 9, 16]`

Expected output: `2` (the largest subset where every pair is divisible is `[2, 16]` or `[4, 16]`).

The program's output for this input is also `2`, which is incorrect because the largest subset where every pair is divisible should include both `2` and `4`.

This example shows that the program does not handle cases where there are multiple elements that are not directly divisible but can form valid pairs with other elements in the subset. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and nums is not an empty list
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Then, it initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1. The function iterates over the list `nums` and for each element, it checks all previous elements to find the longest chain of divisors ending at the current element. It updates the `dp` list accordingly. Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` list. This value represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the original list `nums`. If the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
