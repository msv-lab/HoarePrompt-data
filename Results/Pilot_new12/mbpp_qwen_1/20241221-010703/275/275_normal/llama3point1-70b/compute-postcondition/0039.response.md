Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.***

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated according to the loop's logic, and `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.
- The if part of the if-else block updates `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition simply captures the update of `dp[i]` and the initialization of `dp[k + 1]`.
