Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. This means that if `i` is 1, the loop will run from `j=0` to `j=0` (only once).
   - For the loop to execute even once, `i` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will indeed execute once. No changes are needed to `i` itself for the loop to execute.
   - However, we should ensure that `dp` and `nums` are consistent with the initial conditions and the expected behavior of the loop. Since no specific conditions on `dp` or `nums` are required for the loop to execute based on the given information, they remain as provided.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Given that the loop will execute with `i` being 1, there are no additional adjustments needed beyond ensuring `i` is 1.

Therefore, the state after adjustment remains the same as the initial state provided.

**State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is 1**.
