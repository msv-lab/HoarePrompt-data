Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` where `0 â‰¤ j < i`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
