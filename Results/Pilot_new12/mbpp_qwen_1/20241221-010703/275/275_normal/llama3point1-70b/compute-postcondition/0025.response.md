To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State**: The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i+1]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1` (inclusive), meaning for each `i`, `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`.
3. **Loop Body**: For each `j` in the range, the loop updates `dp[i]` based on whether `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Specifically, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Given this, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop. Let's consider what happens at the end of the previous iteration:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated based on the values of `dp[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new state should reflect the following:
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `dp[i]` is set to be the initial value before it was updated in the previous iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `dp[i]` is reset to its initial value (which would be 1, as it is typically initialized to 1 since the longest chain ending at any element itself is 1).

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i+1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`, and for each `j` from `0` to `i-1`, `dp[i]` is initially set to 1. `i` is incremented by 1.**
