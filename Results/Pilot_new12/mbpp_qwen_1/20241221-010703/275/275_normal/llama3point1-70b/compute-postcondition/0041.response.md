Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is `len(nums)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each index `i` starting from 1 to the length of `nums`.
- For each `i`, it checks all previous indices `j` (from 0 to `i-1`) and updates `dp[i]` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
- After all iterations, `dp[i]` will contain the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]` for every index `i` in the list.
- The value of `i` after the loop finishes will be `len(nums)`, indicating that all elements in `nums` have been processed.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `nums` is empty), `dp` will remain an empty list.
