The code initializes a list `dp` with 1s, where the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, this does not change. The `dp` list is initialized with 1s for each element in `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1**
