Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. After executing the if-else block, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, where `j` is an index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
