Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - After executing the if-else block, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, where `j` is an index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Key Variables:**
   - `i`: The current index being processed in the `dp` list.
   - `j`: The index of the element being checked against `nums[i]`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `i`, the loop checks all `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

5. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, which means considering the next value of `i`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - The next iteration of the loop will start with `i = i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop condition for the next iteration is `j` ranging from `0` to `i`.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - `nums` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `dp[i]` is the updated value from the previous iteration (since `i` is incremented to `i+1`).

8. **Final State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will check all `j` from `0` to `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i+1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`, and the loop will check all `j` from `0` to `i`**.

However, since we are asked to provide the state in a specific format:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i+1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`, `i` is `i+1`, and the loop will check all `j` from `0` to `i`**.
