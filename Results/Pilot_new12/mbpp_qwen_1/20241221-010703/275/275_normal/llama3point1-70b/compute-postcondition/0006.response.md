Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `i-1`.

2. **Identify Relevant States**: From the given information:
   - `total` is not relevant.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each element is `1`.
   - `i` is `1`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is `1`, the loop will run only if `j` ranges from `0` to `0` (inclusive). This means the loop will run exactly once if `i` is `1`.

4. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` is `1`, `j` will start from `0` and go up to `0`. Therefore, `j` must be `0` at the start of the loop for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `nums` and `dp` do not affect the loop execution directly in this context.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0**
