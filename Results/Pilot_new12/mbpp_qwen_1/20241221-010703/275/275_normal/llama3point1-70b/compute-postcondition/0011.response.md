The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` and `j` are both initially 1, this means we are updating `dp[1]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`.

Since the initial state does not provide the value of `dp[1]`, let's denote it as `dp[1] = k`, where `k` is some integer. After executing the code, `dp[1]` will be updated to `max(k, k + 1)`, which simplifies to `k + 1` because `k + 1` is always greater than `k`.

The states of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[1]` is `k + 1` where `k` is the initial value of `dp[1]`**
