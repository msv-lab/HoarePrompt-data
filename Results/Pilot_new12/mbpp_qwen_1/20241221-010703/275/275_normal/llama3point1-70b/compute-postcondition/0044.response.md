Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Then, it initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1. The function iterates over the list `nums` and for each element, it checks all previous elements to find the longest chain of divisors ending at the current element. It updates the `dp` list accordingly. Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` list. This value represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the original list `nums`. If the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0.**

Edge Cases:
- If the input list `nums` is empty, the function correctly returns 0.
- The function handles the case where no divisor chains longer than 1 exist by setting each `dp[i]` to 1 initially and updating it based on valid divisor relationships.
