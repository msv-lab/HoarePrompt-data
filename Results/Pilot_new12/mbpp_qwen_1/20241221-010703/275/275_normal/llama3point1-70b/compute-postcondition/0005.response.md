State before the loop starts: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `nums`: It is already stated that it is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp`: It is a list where each element is initially set to `1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to start with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `1` (which is the starting point of the loop).
   - Since `nums` is already sorted in ascending order and `dp` is initialized with all elements as `1`, no additional adjustments are needed for these lists.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is initialized to `1`.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1, `i` is 1**
