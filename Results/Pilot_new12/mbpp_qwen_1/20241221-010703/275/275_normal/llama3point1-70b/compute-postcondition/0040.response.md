Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. After all iterations of the loop, for every index `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. The value of `i` is `len(nums)`.**
