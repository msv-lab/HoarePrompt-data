The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Here, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[j]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[j]`. Given that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, it means that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is 1, `j` is such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`**
