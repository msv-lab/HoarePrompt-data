Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Additionally, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[1]` is `k + 1` where `k` is the initial value of `dp[1]`.

2. **Loop Statement**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
   ```
   This means `j` will iterate from 0 to `i-1`. Given `i` is 1, `j` will take the values 0 and 1.

3. **Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration (when `j` was 0), the loop body was executed, and since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, it is possible that `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) could be divisible by `nums[j]` (which is `nums[0]`). If this condition is met, `dp[1]` would be updated to `k + 1`, where `k` is the initial value of `dp[1]`.

4. **Current State**: Now, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 1).

5. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration (`j` becomes 1), we need to ensure that `j` is within the range specified by the loop, i.e., `j` should be less than `i`. Since `i` is 1, `j` can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, `j` is now 1.

6. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop is iterating over `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` remains 1, `j` will increment to 1. No other variables are modified by the loop body based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2** (since `j` starts from 0 and increments to 1 in this iteration, it will now be 2 for the next iteration)
