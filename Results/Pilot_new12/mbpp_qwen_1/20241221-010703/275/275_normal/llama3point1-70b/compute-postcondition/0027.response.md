Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i+1]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`. After executing the if statement, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Variable `i` is incremented by 1.***
