`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, but we know that `i` is `m + 1`. Since the exact values of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `j` are not given, we can only say that `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, and `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.**
