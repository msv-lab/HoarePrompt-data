According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must increment to 1. Since `i` is 1, the loop will not execute if `j` is 1 because the range for `j` is from `0` to `i-1` (which is `0` in this case).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1, and since `i` is fixed at 1, no changes are needed for `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1**
