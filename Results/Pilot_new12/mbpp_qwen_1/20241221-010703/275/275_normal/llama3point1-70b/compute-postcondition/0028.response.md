Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. After executing the loop, for every `i` from `1` to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous elements in the list. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `nums` is empty), `dp` remains an empty list.**
