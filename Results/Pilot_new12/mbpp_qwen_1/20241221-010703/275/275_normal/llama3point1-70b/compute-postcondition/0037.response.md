To analyze the given problem, let's break down the initial state and the for loop:

### Initial State:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
- `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that for each `i` (from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`), the loop runs through all values of `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` and updates `dp[i]` accordingly.

2. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, say `i = m` (where `m` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m + 1`.
   - The loop will now run from `j = 0` to `j = m` (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust the state for `i` to `m + 1`.
   - The condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` needs to be checked for all `j` from 0 to `m`.
   - The value of `dp[m + 1]` will be updated based on the loop's execution.

### Final State:
- `nums` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `m + 1`.
- `dp[i]` will be updated according to the loop's logic, but the exact value depends on the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state should be:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for each `j` from 0 to `m`**, and `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.

Since the exact value of `dp[i]` cannot be determined without the loop body, we only need to adjust the `i` and ensure the conditions for the loop's continuation.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `m + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated according to the loop's logic, and `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.**
