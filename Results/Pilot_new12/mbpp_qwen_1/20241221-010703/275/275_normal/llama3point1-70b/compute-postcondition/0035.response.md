The code snippet updates the `dp` list by setting `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is some index before `i`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is being updated to reflect the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

Given the initial state where `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and `dp[k + 1]` is initialized (assuming `k` is the last index of `nums`), the code snippet will iterate over each element in `nums` and update `dp[i]` accordingly.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `dp` are not specified, we can only describe the general effect of the code:

- For each `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for each `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`; `dp[k + 1]` is initialized.**
