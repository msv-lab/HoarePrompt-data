Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i+1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i+1]`, and for each `j` from `0` to `i`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
