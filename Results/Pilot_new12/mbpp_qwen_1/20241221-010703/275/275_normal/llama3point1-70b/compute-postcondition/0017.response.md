According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to 1 (the start of the loop), and the condition `i < len(nums)` must still hold true.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` in each iteration.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `len(nums)`.
4. However, since the loop condition is `i < len(nums)`, `i` cannot be incremented further because it would no longer satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the only way to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time is to reset `i` to 1 and ensure that the condition `i < len(nums)` still holds true.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is 1.**
