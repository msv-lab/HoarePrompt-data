Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where each element is initially 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `i = 1`.
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`, which is `j = 0`.

2. **First Iteration (i = 1, j = 0):**
   - Check if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`.
   - If true, update `dp[1]` to `max(dp[1], dp[0] + 1)`.
   - Since `dp[0]` is initially 1, `dp[1]` becomes `max(1, 1 + 1) = 2`.

3. **Second Iteration (i = 2, j = 0):**
   - Check if `nums[2] % nums[0] == 0`.
   - Update `dp[2]` to `max(dp[2], dp[0] + 1)`.
   - Since `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[2]` becomes `max(1, 1 + 1) = 2`.

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2, j = 1):**
   - Check if `nums[2] % nums[1] == 0`.
   - Update `dp[2]` to `max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)`.
   - Since `dp[1]` is now 2, `dp[2]` becomes `max(2, 2 + 1) = 3`.

5. **General Iteration (i-th iteration, j from 0 to i-1):**
   - For each `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`, check if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
   - If true, update `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

### Final State After All Iterations:

- The loop iterates over each index `i` starting from 1 up to the length of `nums` minus 1.
- For each `i`, `dp[i]` is updated based on the divisibility condition and the maximum value found among `dp[j] + 1` for all valid `j`.

### Output State:
- `nums` remains unchanged as it is only used in the condition.
- `dp` will be updated such that `dp[i]` contains the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` will be the last index processed, which is `len(nums) - 1`.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is:

**Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is the last index processed, which is `len(nums) - 1`.**
