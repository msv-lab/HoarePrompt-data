The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the condition for updating `dp[i]` is satisfied.

Since the initial value of `dp[i]` (which is `dp[1]`) is not specified, let's denote it as `dp_initial`. The value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is also not specified, so let's denote it as `dp_j`.

The code will set `dp[1]` to be the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] + 1`. So, `dp[1]` will be updated to `max(dp_initial, dp_j + 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[1]` is max(`dp_initial`, `dp_j` + 1), and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
