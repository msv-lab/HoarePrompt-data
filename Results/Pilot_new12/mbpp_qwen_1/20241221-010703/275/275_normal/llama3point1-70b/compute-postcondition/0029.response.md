To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and follow the steps:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - After executing the loop, for every `i` from `1` to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous elements in the list.

2. **Current Iteration State**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - For each `i` from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`, the loop calculates the value of `dp[i]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To move to the next iteration of the loop, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, after the current iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(nums)`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The loop will continue to execute if `i + 1 < len(nums)`, which means `i` must still be within the bounds of the list.

Given the above points, we can conclude the following state for the next iteration:

- `nums` remains the same as it was before the loop.
- `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` is calculated based on the values of `nums` up to the current `i`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot provide specific details about the updated `dp` values, but we know they will be updated based on the new `i` value.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and the condition for the loop to continue is `i + 1 < len(nums)`**.

However, since we are focusing on the state adjustment, we can simplify this to:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
