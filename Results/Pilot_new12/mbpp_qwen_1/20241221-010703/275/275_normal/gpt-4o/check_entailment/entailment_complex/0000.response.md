Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Empty List Handling**: The program checks if the list is empty using `if (not nums) : return 0`. This ensures that if the input list is empty, the function correctly returns `0`.

3. **Sorting**: The list is sorted in ascending order using `nums.sort()`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the largest subset where each element divides the next.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element. The program iterates through the list, updating the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition (`nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`).

5. **Result Calculation**: The function finally returns `max(dp)`, which gives the size of the largest subset satisfying the divisibility condition.

Given these steps, the program correctly identifies the size of the largest subset of numbers from the input list where every pair is divisible. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
