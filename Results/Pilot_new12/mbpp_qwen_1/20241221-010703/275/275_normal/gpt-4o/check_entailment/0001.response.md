Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The function sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to keep track of the largest subset size ending at each element. Given the test cases:

1. For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` with a size of 4.
2. For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]` with a size of 3.
3. For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` with a size of 4.

These test cases cover various scenarios including cases with smaller numbers dividing larger ones, and the function handles these cases correctly. Since the provided code logic appears sound and the test cases do not reveal any issues, the program is correct.
