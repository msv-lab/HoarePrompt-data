Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if it is. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order to facilitate the divisibility check. The dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` list ensures that for each element, it checks all previous elements to see if the current element is divisible by them and updates the `dp` list accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset meeting the criteria.

Given the assertions provided:
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4`: The largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3`: The largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`.
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4`: The largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

The code handles these cases correctly, and the provided output hints also confirm that the code works as intended. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
