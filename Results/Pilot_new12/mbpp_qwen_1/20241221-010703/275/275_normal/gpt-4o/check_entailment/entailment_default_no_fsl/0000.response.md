Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible. The code handles all given test cases correctly and follows the problem description. The logic of sorting the list and using a `dp` array to keep track of the longest subsequence that satisfies the condition is sound. Given the examples and the problem description, the code appears to work for all potential cases.
