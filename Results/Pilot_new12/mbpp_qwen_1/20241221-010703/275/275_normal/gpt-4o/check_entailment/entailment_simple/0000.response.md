Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which matches the expected input according to the problem description.

2. **Base Case Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the correct result since there are no elements to form a subset.

3. **Sorting the List**: The list is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is a common step in dynamic programming solutions for subset problems, as it helps in efficiently determining divisibility relationships between elements.

4. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: A list `dp` is initialized with 1s, representing the minimum possible size of a subset ending at each index. This initialization ensures that each element is initially considered as its own subset.

5. **Nested Loops for Subset Calculation**: The nested loops iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `j < i`. For each pair, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the `dp[i]` value is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This ensures that the `dp` table keeps track of the largest subset ending at each index.

6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset meeting the criteria.

Since the program correctly handles the sorting, dynamic programming approach, and the subset divisibility condition, it satisfies the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
