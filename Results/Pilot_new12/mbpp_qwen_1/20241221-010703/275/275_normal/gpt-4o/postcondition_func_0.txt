The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list in ascending order. Then, it initializes a list `dp` where each element is set to 1, representing the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with all previous elements to update the `dp` list accordingly. Finally, the function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` list. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.
