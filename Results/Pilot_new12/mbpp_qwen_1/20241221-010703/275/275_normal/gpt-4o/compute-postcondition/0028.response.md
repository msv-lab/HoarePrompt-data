Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element, `nums[i]` is the last element of `nums`, `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` for all valid `j`.** 

Explanation:
- After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- For each `i` in the range of the length of `nums`, the loop checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for all `j < i`. If so, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[j] + 1`, ensuring that `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` such that each element is a multiple of the previous one.
- Initially, `dp` is correctly initialized to 1 for each index, representing the trivial subsequence consisting of a single element.
- The loop updates `dp[i]` based on the divisibility condition, and since the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order, the condition ensures that if `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, then `nums[j]` is the largest possible value less than `nums[i]` that can form part of the subsequence ending at `i`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `nums` is empty), both `i` and `dp` would remain their initial values. However, since the problem guarantees that the loop executes at least once, we do not need to consider this edge case explicitly in the final output state.
