Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is either 1 or 0.
   - `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to `i-1`.
   - `nums[i]` is an integer.
   - `nums[j]` is an integer.
   - If the remainder when `nums[i]` is divided by `nums[j]` is 0, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
   - For each value of `j`, the condition inside the loop body is checked.
   - The update to `dp[i]` depends on the values of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 0, we need to consider both cases separately.
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `j` will iterate from 0 to 0 (only once).
     - After this single iteration, `j` will be 0.
     - We need to check the condition in the loop body and adjust the state accordingly.
   - For `i = 0`:
     - `j` will iterate from 0 to -1 (no iterations since `range(0)` is empty).
     - No changes are made to `dp` or other variables.
     - The state remains as it was before the loop.

5. **Detailed Adjustments:**
   - For `i = 1`:
     - After the first iteration, `j` will be 0.
     - Check the condition: If `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, then `dp[1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] + 1`.
     - The new state will depend on the result of this condition.
   - For `i = 0`:
     - No changes occur, so the state remains as it was.

Given these considerations, let's summarize the states:

- **For `i = 1`:**
  - `j` will be 0 after the loop.
  - The state will be adjusted based on the condition `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`.

- **For `i = 0`:**
  - No changes occur, so the state remains as it was.

### Example Answers:
- **If `i = 1`:**
  - State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to 0, `nums[1]` is an integer, `nums[0]` is an integer, `dp[1]` is updated if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0` to the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] + 1` otherwise.**
- **If `i = 0`:**
  - State: **`i` is 0, `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to -1 (empty), `nums[0]` is an integer, no changes to `dp[0]` since no iterations occurred.**

In summary, the state adjustments depend on the specific value of `i` and the outcome of the loop condition.
