The code initializes a new list `dp` with a length equal to the length of `nums`, where each element is set to 1. The initial state of `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

After executing the code:

- `dp` is created with a length equal to the length of `nums`.
- Each element in `dp` is initialized to 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1.**
