According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop will execute if `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1. 

Before the loop starts, the following conditions must be true:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the initial state to include the necessary starting value for `i`. Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`, we need to specify that `i` is 0 initially.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, `i` is 0**
