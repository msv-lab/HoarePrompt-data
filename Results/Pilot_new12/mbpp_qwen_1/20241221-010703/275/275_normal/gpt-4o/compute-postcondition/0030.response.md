State before the loop starts: The loop cannot execute because the condition `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. Since the state before the loop starts says "No adjustment needed; the loop cannot execute one more time," it implies that `i` is currently 0 or less.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0**
