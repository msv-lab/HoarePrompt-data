The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is not defined in the provided code, it implies that `j` could be any index up to `-1`, which is invalid in a typical context (as list indices start from 0). However, assuming the intention is to consider valid indices up to `i-1`, let's proceed with the assumption that `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to -1 (which is not possible since indices start from 0, but let's assume the array is of size at least 1).

Since `i` is 1, the valid range for `j` is from 0 to 0. Therefore, `j` can only be 0.

The code snippet `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` will be evaluated as:
- `dp[1] = max(dp[1], dp[0] + 1)`

Since `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is being updated based on `dp[0]`. Let's assume `dp[0]` is initialized to some value, say `k`.

So, `dp[1]` will be updated to `max(k, k + 1)`, which simplifies to `k + 1` because `k + 1` is always greater than `k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1; `dp[0]` is initialized, `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + 1`**
