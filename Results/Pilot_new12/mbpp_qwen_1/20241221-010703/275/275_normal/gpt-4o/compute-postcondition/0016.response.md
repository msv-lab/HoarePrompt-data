Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, where for each `i`, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element, `i` is the length of `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The `dp` array is updated during the loop to reflect the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index `i` where each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list because the loop iterates over all indices from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- Each element `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for all `j < i`. If this condition is met, `dp[i]` is set to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `dp[i]` will hold the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` satisfying the given condition, and `i` will be equal to the length of `nums`.
