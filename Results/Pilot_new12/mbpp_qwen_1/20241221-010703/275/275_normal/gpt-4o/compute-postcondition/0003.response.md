The `sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. After sorting, the original list is modified. All elements in the list will be rearranged in ascending order, but their specific values depend on the initial content of the list. Since the initial values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements after sorting, but we know that they will be in ascending order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
