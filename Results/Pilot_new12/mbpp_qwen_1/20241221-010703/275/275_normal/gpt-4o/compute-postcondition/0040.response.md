Output State: **`i` is the length of `nums`, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of increasing subsequence starting from each index `j` (where `j < i`) such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, `nums` is the original list of numbers, and `dp` is the dynamic programming array initialized to 0s.** 

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** The loop iterates over each element `i` in the range defined by `range(i)`, which means the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`.
- **Condition:** Inside the loop, the condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:` checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
- **Update:** If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This indicates that `dp[i]` keeps track of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i` where each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.

After the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1), `dp[i]` will contain the maximum length of increasing subsequences starting from each index `j` (where `j < i`) such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

If the loop does not execute at all (e.g., if `nums` is an empty list), then `dp` will remain as it was initialized, which is a list of zeros of the same length as `nums`.
