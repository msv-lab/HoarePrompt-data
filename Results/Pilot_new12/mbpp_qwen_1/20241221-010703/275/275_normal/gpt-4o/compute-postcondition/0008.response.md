The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, we know that `dp[i]` was initially set to 1. Since `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, we know that `i` is not the first index (as `i` is greater than 0) and that there exists some `j` such that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Let's denote the initial value of `dp[i]` as 1. After executing the line of code, `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum of 1 and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp[j]` was also initialized to 1, the value of `dp[j] + 1` is 2. Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to 2 if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the initial value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, `dp[i]` is 2, and `dp[j]` is 1.**
