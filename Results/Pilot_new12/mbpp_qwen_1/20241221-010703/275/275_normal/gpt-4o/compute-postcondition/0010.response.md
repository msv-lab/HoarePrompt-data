According to the code, the loop is iterating over the range from `0` to `i-1`. The loop variable `j` takes on values from `0` up to `i-1`. The conditions for updating `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` depend on whether `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following state is given:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1.
- `i` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. Therefore, `j` will now iterate from `0` to `i`.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration with `i` incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. The condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` will be checked for each `j` in the range `0` to `i - 1` (inclusive).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
