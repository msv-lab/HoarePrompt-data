Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, `i` is greater than 0. If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[i]` is 2 and `dp[j]` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` remain unchanged.***
