To understand which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, where for each `i`, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element.
   - `i` is the current index being considered in the `dp` array.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`.
   - This means that for each value of `i`, the loop will iterate over all indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **What the Loop Does**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the context of dynamic programming and subsequences, the loop likely updates the `dp` array by considering elements from the `nums` list up to index `i-1`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`nums`**: Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, no adjustments are needed for this list itself.
   - **`dp`**: For the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that `dp` is correctly initialized or updated for the indices relevant to the loop.
   - **`i`**: The loop starts with `i` being the current index in the `dp` array, so we need to ensure `i` is set to an appropriate starting value (typically 1 or 0, depending on the problem definition).

Given the context, the critical adjustment involves ensuring that `i` is correctly set to the starting index of the loop, and the `dp` array is properly initialized or has the correct values for the indices up to `i-1`.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- Ensure `i` is set to an appropriate starting value, typically 1 or 0.
- Ensure that `dp` is correctly initialized for the indices up to `i-1` (though the exact initialization depends on the specific problem details).

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 1 (or 0, depending on the problem definition), `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to `i-1`**
