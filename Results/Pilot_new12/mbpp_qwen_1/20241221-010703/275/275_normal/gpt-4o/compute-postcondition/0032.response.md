The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `i` and `j` being greater than 0 and `nums[i]` being divisible by `nums[j]` are preconditions that are still valid. However, without knowing the exact initial values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`, we can only say that `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`**
