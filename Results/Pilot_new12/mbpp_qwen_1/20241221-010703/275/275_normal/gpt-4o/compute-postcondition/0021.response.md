Postcondition: ***`i` is either 1 or 0; `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to `i-1`; `nums[i]` is an integer; `nums[j]` is an integer; if the remainder when `nums[i]` is divided by `nums[j]` is 0, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.***
