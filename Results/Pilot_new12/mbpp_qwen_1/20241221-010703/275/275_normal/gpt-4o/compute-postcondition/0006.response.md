Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop `for j in range(i):` will execute as long as `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`.

2. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for j in range(i):` to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. If `i` is 0, the range `range(i)` would be an empty range, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, `i` is greater than 0**
