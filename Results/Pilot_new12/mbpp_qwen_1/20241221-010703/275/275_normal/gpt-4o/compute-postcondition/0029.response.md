To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of `nums`. This means the previous iteration was the last iteration over `nums`.
   - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is a multiple of the previous element.
   - `nums[i]` is the last element of `nums`. Since `i` is the length of `nums`, there is no valid `nums[i]` because the index is out of bounds (Python lists are zero-indexed).
   - `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` for all valid `j`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(nums) - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums)`.

Given that `i` is already equal to the length of `nums`, the condition `i < len(nums)` will not be satisfied anymore. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time.

However, if we were to consider the states needed for the next iteration hypothetically, it would be:

- `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` would be `len(nums) + 1`.
- The loop would then check the condition `len(nums) + 1 < len(nums)`, which is false.

Since the loop cannot execute one more time based on the current states, we need to express this explicitly.

**Answer:**
The loop cannot execute one more time because `i` is already equal to the length of `nums`, making the condition `i < len(nums)` false. Therefore, no adjustment is needed since the loop will not proceed.

State: **No adjustment needed; the loop cannot execute one more time.**
