According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified by `range(i)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1.
- `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
1. `i` must remain the same because the loop is iterating over `j` up to `i-1`.
2. The condition `j < i` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

Since the loop is about to start its first iteration for the current value of `i`, `i` will be used as the upper limit for `j` (which starts at 0). Therefore, the loop can execute again if `i` is still greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `nums` remains the same.
- `dp` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same, as it defines the range of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1.**
