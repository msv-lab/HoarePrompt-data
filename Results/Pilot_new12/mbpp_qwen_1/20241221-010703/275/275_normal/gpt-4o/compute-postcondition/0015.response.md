Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. No updates occur if `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`.***
