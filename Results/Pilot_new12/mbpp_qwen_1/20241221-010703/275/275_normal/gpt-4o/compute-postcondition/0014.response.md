The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Here, `i` and `j` are indices into the lists `nums` and `dp`, respectively. However, since no specific value for `j` is given, we can't determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. We only know that `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers of the same length as `nums`, with each element initialized to 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some index `j`.**
