To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will execute again. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - \(i\) is an integer greater than 1.
   - \(dp[i]\) is updated to be the maximum of its current value and \(dp[j] + 1\) for some integer \(j\) where \(j < i\), provided that \(nums[i] \% nums[j] == 0\). If the condition \(nums[i] \% nums[j] == 0\) does not hold, \(dp[i]\) remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(i-1\), i.e., for \(j\) in range \(i\).

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the loop variable \(j\) must take values from 0 to \(i-1\).
   - The value of \(i\) itself does not change within the loop; it only changes after the loop completes.
   - The critical point here is the condition \(nums[i] \% nums[j] == 0\). This condition determines if the update to \(dp[i]\) happens or not.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since \(i\) is an integer greater than 1, the next iteration will increment \(i\) to \(i+1\).
   - The loop will then check for \(j\) in the range from 0 to \(i\).

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - The value of \(i\) will be incremented by 1, so the new value of \(i\) will be \(i+1\).
   - The condition \(nums[i] \% nums[j] == 0\) will be checked for each \(j\) in the range 0 to \(i\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is an integer greater than 2, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some integer `j` where `j < i`, provided that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. If the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` does not hold, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
