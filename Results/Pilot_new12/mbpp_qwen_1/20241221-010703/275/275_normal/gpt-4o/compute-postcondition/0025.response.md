To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is 0.
  - `dp` remains correctly initialized for indices up to -1 (empty).
  - The condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some index `j` updates `dp[0]` to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `dp[0]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i)` means that the loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will not execute at all because `range(0)` results in an empty sequence.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dp` is correctly initialized for indices up to -1, meaning `dp[-1]` exists but other indices might not.
   - No changes to `dp[0]` occurred since the loop did not run.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - When `i` becomes 1, the loop will run for `j` from 0 to 0 (since `range(1)` includes 0).

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The loop body will check `dp[0]` and update it if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`. However, since `i` is 1 now, `j` will only be 0, and the condition `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0` will be checked.
   - `dp` remains correctly initialized for indices up to -1.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `dp` remains correctly initialized for indices up to -1**.

This ensures that the loop can execute for `j` in `range(1)`, allowing the condition to be evaluated and potentially updating `dp[0]`.
