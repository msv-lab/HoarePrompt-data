Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The assertions in the code verify that the function returns the correct volume for the given radius and height values. Since the problem description asks to write a function to find the volume of a cone and the provided code performs this task correctly for the given test cases, and there are no conditional checks or error handling needed for this straightforward calculation, the code is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
