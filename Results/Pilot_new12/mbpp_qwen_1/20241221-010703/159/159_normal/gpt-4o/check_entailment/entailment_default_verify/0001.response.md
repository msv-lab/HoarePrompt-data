Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The test cases provided using `math.isclose` confirm that the function returns values that are sufficiently close to the expected results. The output hints indicate that the function assumes non-negative floating-point inputs for `radius` and `height`, which aligns with the typical usage of such a function. Given that the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, and the provided implementation meets this requirement without any apparent issues or edge cases needing to be handled, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
