Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function is tested with three different sets of inputs, and the results are verified using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001, which indicates that the function is returning values that are sufficiently close to the expected results. Given the general form of the formula and the provided test cases, the function appears to be correctly implemented and should work for any valid positive inputs for radius and height. Therefore, based on the information provided, the program is correct.
