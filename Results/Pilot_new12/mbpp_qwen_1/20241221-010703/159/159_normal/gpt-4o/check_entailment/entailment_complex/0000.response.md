Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating-point numbers, as specified in the problem description. The function directly computes and returns the volume using the formula, without any additional checks or modifications on the input parameters. The provided test cases using `math.isclose` confirm that the function returns the expected values within a relative tolerance of 0.001, which further verifies its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
