Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the program is intended to calculate the volume of a cone. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating-point numbers, and correctly implements the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The provided assertions check the function with three different sets of inputs, and the results are verified using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001, indicating that the function returns values sufficiently close to the expected results. Since the annotations match the function's behavior and the original assessment is based on these factors, the original assessment is accurate.
