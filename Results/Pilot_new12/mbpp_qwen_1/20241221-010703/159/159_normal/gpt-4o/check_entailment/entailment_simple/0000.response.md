Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Formula Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly uses the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\) to calculate the volume of a cone, where `radius` is \(r\) and `height` is \(h\).

2. **Assertions**: The assertions check the function against known correct values for the volume of cones with different radii and heights. The calculated volumes match the expected results within a relative tolerance of 0.001, confirming the function's accuracy.

3. **Input Validity Assumption**: As stated in the problem description, the inputs (radius and height) are assumed to be valid non-negative floating-point numbers. The program does not explicitly handle invalid inputs, but this is consistent with the given assumptions.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description.
