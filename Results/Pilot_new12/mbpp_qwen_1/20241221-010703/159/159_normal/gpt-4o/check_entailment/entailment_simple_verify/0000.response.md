Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The annotated version confirms that the inputs (radius and height) are non-negative floating-point numbers, and the function returns the expected result. The test cases provided using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 validate that the function outputs the correct volumes for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and there is no evidence from the annotations that contradicts the original assessment.
