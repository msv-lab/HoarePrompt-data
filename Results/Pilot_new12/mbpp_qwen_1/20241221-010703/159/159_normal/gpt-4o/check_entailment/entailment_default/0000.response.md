Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The test cases using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 confirm that the function produces accurate results for the given examples. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, and the code directly applies the mathematical formula without any logical errors or edge cases, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the given assumptions.
