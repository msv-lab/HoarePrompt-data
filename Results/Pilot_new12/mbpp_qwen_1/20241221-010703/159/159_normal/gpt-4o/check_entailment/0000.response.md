Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The given test cases assert that the function returns values that are mathematically close to the expected results within a relative tolerance of 0.001. Since the program follows the problem description and the provided test cases do not reveal any issues, we can conclude that the program works correctly for the given requirements.
