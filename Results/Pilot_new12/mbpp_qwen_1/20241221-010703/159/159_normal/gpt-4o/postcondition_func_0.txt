The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the value of \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. This calculation corresponds to the volume of a cone with the given radius and height. Since the code only includes the calculation and does not perform any checks or modifications on the input parameters, the function assumes that the inputs are valid (non-negative). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be considered, as the calculation is straightforward and does not involve any conditional logic or error handling.
