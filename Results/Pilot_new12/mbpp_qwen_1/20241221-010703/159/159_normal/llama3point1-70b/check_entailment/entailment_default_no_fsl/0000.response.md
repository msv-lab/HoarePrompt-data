Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, but the provided code calculates the volume of a cylinder instead. The formula used in the function is for a cylinder, not a cone. The correct formula for the volume of a cone is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), which is the same as the formula used in the code. However, the problem description specifically states that the task is to find the volume of a cone, and the function name and description in the code do not reflect this. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
