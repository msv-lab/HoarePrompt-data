Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the problem description because it calculates the volume of a cylinder instead of a cone. The formula used in the function, \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), is the formula for the volume of a cone. However, the problem description asks for the volume of a cone, which uses a slightly different formula: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \) (this part is correct), but the function name and the context suggest a cylinder. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.
