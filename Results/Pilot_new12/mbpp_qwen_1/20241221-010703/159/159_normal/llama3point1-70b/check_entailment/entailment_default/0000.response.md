Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the volume of a cylinder, not a cone. The formula used in the function is for the volume of a cylinder, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), but the problem description asks for the volume of a cone, whose formula is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \) as well. However, the function name `func_1` and the lack of any cone-specific logic indicate that the function is incorrectly named and does not match the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
