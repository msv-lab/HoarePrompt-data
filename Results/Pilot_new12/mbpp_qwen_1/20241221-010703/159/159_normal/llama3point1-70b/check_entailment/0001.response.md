Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. This formula is accurate and the function implements it properly. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that this function does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
