Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone, but the problem description actually asks for the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). However, the function provided calculates the volume of a cylinder, which uses the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\) but is typically used for a different geometric shape. Since the function does not match the problem description, the program is incorrect.
