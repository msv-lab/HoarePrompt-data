Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are specified to be non-negative floating point numbers in the problem description. The function returns the calculated volume as a floating point number, which aligns with the expected output. Since the program correctly implements the formula and handles the input as described, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
