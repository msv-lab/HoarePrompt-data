Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The annotated version confirms that the inputs `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers, which are valid for calculating the volume of a cone. Since the function handles these inputs correctly and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases not handled, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
