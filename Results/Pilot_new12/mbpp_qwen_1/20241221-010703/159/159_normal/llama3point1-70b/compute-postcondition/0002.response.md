Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both non-negative floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code provided matches the intended behavior. The function does not handle negative values or non-floating-point inputs for `radius` and `height`, nor does it validate these inputs. Therefore, the final state of the program after executing the function is that it returns a single floating-point number representing the volume of the cylinder, given valid non-negative floating-point inputs for `radius` and `height`.**
