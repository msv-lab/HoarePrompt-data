#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of integers or floats, `product` is the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last element in the `numbers` list.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #`The program returns the product of all elements in the 'numbers' list divided by the length of the 'numbers' list`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the `numbers` list and then divides this product by the length of the `numbers` list. The function returns the resulting value. Potential edge cases include the possibility of an empty list, in which case the function would return 0 (since the product of an empty list is 1 and dividing by the length 0 gives 0). The function does not handle non-numeric elements in the list; if such elements are present, it will raise a `TypeError`.
