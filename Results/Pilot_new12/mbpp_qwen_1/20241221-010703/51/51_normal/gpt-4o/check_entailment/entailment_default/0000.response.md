Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function handles all potential cases appropriately:

1. It works for lists containing integers or floats.
2. It returns 0 for an empty list, as the product of an empty list is 1, and dividing 1 by the length (which is 0) is considered 0.
3. It does not handle non-numeric elements in the list, but this is not required according to the problem description.

Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases within the given constraints, the correctness is **True**.
