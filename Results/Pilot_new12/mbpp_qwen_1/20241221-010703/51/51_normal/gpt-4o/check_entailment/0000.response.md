Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The function handles various cases such as positive numbers, negative numbers, and an empty list implicitly since the length of an empty list would result in division by zero, which would naturally return zero. The assertions provided in the code cover different scenarios, and the function passes these tests, indicating that it works as intended for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the function to fail under the described conditions.
