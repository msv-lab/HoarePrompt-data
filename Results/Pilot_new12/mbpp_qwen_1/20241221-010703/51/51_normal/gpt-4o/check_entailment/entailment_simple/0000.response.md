Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it aligns with the description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers or floats. This matches the problem description that requires a function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

2. **Multiplication Logic**: Inside the function, a variable `product` is initialized to 1. A `for` loop iterates over each number in the list `numbers`, multiplying the `product` by each number. After the loop, `product` holds the multiplication of all elements in the list.

3. **Division Logic**: After the loop, the function divides the `product` by the length of the list `numbers` to get the final result. This operation satisfies the requirement to "divide with the length of the list."

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions check the function against different inputs to ensure it works as expected. The `math.isclose` function with a relative tolerance is used to account for floating-point precision issues, which is appropriate for this type of calculation.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
