Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to multiply all the numbers in the list and then divide the product by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input types (integers or floats) and provides the correct output for the given assertions. The potential edge case of an empty list is handled correctly, returning 0 as the result. There are no contradictions between the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints that would indicate the function is incorrect.
