Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions in the code cover several test cases, including both positive and negative numbers, as well as a case with an empty list, which is handled appropriately (returning 0).

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of numbers), the code correctly handles the multiplication and division as required. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints.
