Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers or floats.
   - A variable `product` is initialized to 1, and a `for` loop iterates over each number in the list, multiplying the `product` by each number.
   - After the loop, the product is divided by the length of the list, and the result is returned.

3. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - The program handles the multiplication and division as required by the problem description.
   - For an empty list, the initial value of `product` (which is 1) ensures that the final result is 0, as the product of an empty list is considered to be 1, and dividing by the length (0) results in 0.
   - No error handling is needed for non-numeric elements since the problem description assumes valid inputs.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions validate the function against different sets of input values, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios.

Given these points, the function `func_1` accurately implements the specified behavior, and thus the program is correct.
