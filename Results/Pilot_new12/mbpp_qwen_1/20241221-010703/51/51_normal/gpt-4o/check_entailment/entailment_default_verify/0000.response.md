Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, as required. The output hints confirm that the function handles the multiplication and division operations as expected, including the edge case of an empty list returning 0. While the output hints also mention potential issues with non-numeric elements in the list, the original assessment does not require the function to handle such cases, as long as the input is valid (as stated in the problem description and output hints). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program remains correct.
