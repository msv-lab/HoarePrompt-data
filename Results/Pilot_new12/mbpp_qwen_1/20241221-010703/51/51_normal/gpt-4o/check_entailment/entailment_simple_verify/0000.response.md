Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotated version of the code provides clear states at different parts of the program, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The provided assertions cover different scenarios (positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both) and the function passes these tests, indicating its correctness. There are no issues with handling invalid inputs as per the assumption that valid input is always provided. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
