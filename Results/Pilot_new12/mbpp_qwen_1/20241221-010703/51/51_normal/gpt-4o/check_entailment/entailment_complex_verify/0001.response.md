Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the function behaves as intended. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of both, and the function passes these tests. Although the annotated version mentions potential edge cases like non-numeric elements in the list, the problem description assumes valid input, so these cases do not affect the correctness of the program under the given conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
