The code multiplies the `product` by the `num`, which is the third element in the `numbers` list. The initial state is that `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements, `product` is the product of the first, second, and third elements of the `numbers` list, and `num` is the third element in the list.

After executing `product *= num`, the new value of `product` is the original `product` multiplied by `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements, `product` is the product of the first, second, and third elements of the `numbers` list, multiplied by the third element, `num` is the third element in the list**
