According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will execute if the `numbers` list contains at least one element.

At the start of the loop, the `product` variable is set to 1. This value does not affect whether the loop will execute; it only initializes the product for use within the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `numbers` list must contain at least one element.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least one element, `product` is 1**
