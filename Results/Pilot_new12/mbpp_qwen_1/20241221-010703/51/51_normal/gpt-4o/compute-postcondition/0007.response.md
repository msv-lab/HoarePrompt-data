Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats, `product` is the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last element in the `numbers` list.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `product` is set to 1.
- For each iteration of the loop, `product` is updated by multiplying it with the current element `num`.
- After all iterations, `product` will be the result of multiplying all elements in the `numbers` list together.
- `num` will be the last element in the `numbers` list because the loop iterates through each element in the list sequentially.
- If the `numbers` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and `product` will remain 1, as it was initialized.

Therefore, after the loop completes, `product` will be the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, and `num` will be the last element in the list.
