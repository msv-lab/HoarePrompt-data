Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the `numbers` list and then divides this product by the length of the `numbers` list. The function returns the resulting value. Potential edge cases include the possibility of an empty list, in which case the function would return 0 (since the product of an empty list is 1 and dividing by the length 0 gives 0). The function does not handle non-numeric elements in the list; if such elements are present, it will raise a `TypeError`.**
