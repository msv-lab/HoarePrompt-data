`product` is multiplied by `num`, which is the first element of the `numbers` list. Since `product` was initially the second element of the `numbers` list, after executing `product *= num`, `product` will now be the product of `num` and the second element of the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is the product of the first and second elements of the `numbers` list**
