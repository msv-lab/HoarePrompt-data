#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a non-empty list, `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of all elements in the list 'numbers' divided by the length of 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The function returns the resulting value. The function handles the case where `numbers` is a non-empty list. If the list is empty, the division by zero error would occur, but the code does not handle this edge case. Therefore, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if `numbers` is an empty list.
