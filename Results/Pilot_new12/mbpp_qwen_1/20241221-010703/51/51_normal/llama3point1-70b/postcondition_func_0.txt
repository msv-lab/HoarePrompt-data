The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The function returns the resulting value. The function handles the case where `numbers` is a non-empty list. If the list is empty, the division by zero error would occur, but the code does not handle this edge case. Therefore, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if `numbers` is an empty list.
