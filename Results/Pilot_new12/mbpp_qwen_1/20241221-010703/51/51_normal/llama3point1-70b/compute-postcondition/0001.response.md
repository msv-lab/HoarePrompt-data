According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. The loop will execute if the list `numbers` is non-empty. Additionally, we need to consider the initial state of the variable `product`, which is given as 1.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Check the List `numbers`:** The loop requires `numbers` to be a non-empty list to ensure there are elements to iterate over.
2. **Initial Value of `product`:** The variable `product` is initially set to 1. This value does not directly affect whether the loop can execute but is important for understanding the context within the loop body.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments are:

- `numbers` must be a non-empty list.
- `product` remains 1 (though this is not required for the loop to execute).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`numbers` must be a non-empty list, `product` is 1**
