The `product` variable is multiplied by the `num` variable. The initial state is that `numbers` is a non-empty list, `product` is the next element from `numbers`, and `num` is the next element from the `numbers` list. After executing the line `product *= num`, the value of `product` will be updated to its current value multiplied by `num`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list, `product` is the next element from `numbers` multiplied by `num`, `num` is the next element from the `numbers` list**
