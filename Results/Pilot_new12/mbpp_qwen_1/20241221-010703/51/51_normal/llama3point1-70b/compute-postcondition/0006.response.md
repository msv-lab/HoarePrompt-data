The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by the next element in the `numbers` list, which is assigned to `num`. The value of `product` is updated accordingly. The other variables are not affected.

Let's denote the initial value of `numbers` as `[a, b, c, ...]`, where `a` is the first element (which is already used in `product`), `b` is the second element, and so on. After the code runs, `product` will be updated to `product * b`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list with at least one element left; `product` is the next element from `numbers` multiplied by the current `num`; `num` is the next element from the `numbers` list; `product` is updated to `product * num`.**
