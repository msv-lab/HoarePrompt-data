According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. The loop will continue as long as `numbers` is a non-empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list, `product` is equal to `num`, and `num` is an element from the `numbers` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must still be non-empty, and `num` will be the next element in the list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`numbers` must be a non-empty list, `product` is the next element from `numbers`, `num` is the next element from the `numbers` list**
