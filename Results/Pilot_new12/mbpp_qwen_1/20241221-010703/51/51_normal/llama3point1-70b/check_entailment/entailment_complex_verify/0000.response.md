Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is based on the assumption that the input list is non-empty. However, the annotated version highlights an important edge case: if the input list `numbers` is empty, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because it attempts to divide the product (which is 1) by the length of the list (which is 0). Since the problem description does not explicitly state how the function should handle an empty list, it is reasonable to conclude that the function should either handle this case (e.g., return 0) or clearly document that it raises an error for empty lists. As the current implementation does not address this case, the program does not fully meet the problem description.
