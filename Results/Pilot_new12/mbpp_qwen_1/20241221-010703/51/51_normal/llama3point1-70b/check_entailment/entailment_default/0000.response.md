Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers and calculates the product of all elements in the list, then divides the product by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where the list is non-empty, returning the correct result. Although the hints also mention that the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the list is empty, the problem description does not explicitly handle this case. Given the instruction to assume valid input, the function is considered correct under these assumptions.
