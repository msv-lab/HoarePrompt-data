Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers or floats as input, calculates the product of all elements in the list, and then divides the product by the length of the list. The program handles the case where the list is non-empty, which is sufficient given the assumption that the input will be valid.

The function does not explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty, but according to the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid, this edge case is not required to be handled. Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the problem description for every potential valid case.
