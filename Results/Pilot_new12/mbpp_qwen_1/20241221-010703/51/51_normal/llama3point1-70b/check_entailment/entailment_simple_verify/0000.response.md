Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the result by the length of the list. The annotation specifies that `numbers` is a non-empty list and `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, which aligns with the problem description. The function performs the required operation for any valid input list of integers or floats, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the program to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements, and the original assessment is correct.
