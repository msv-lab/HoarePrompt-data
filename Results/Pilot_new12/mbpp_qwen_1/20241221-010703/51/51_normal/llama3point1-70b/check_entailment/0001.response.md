Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description. The code handles an empty list gracefully by returning 0 (since `len([])` is 0, and `product / 0` would be undefined, but the initial `product` is set to 1, making the result 0). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
