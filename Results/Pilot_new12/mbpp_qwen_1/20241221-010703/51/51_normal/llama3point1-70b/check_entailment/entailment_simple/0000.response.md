Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(numbers)` takes a list of integers or floats as input.
2. **Product Calculation**: It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and iterates through each number in the list, multiplying them together. This ensures that `product` is the product of all elements in the list.
3. **Division by Length**: After the loop, the function divides the computed product by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`). This fulfills the requirement of dividing the product by the length of the list.

Given the assumptions that the input will always be a valid list (non-empty) of integers or floats, the program will always perform the required operation correctly, thus meeting the problem description.
