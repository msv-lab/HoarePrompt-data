Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the program's behavior. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations confirm that for each iteration of the loop, `k` is incremented until a triangular number with the required number of digits is found. The test cases provided (`func_1(2) == 4`, `func_1(3) == 14`, `func_1(4) == 45`) are consistent with the expected results, and the logic in the function is sound. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would make the function incorrect for other inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
