Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The output hints further confirm that the function handles valid positive integer inputs appropriately and returns the expected result. The original assessment is accurate because the function uses the correct formula for triangular numbers and iterates until it finds the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The test cases provided also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
