Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each given \( n \), the function finds the smallest integer \( k \) such that the triangular number \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) has exactly \( n \) digits. The while loop continues to increment \( k \) until the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches \( n \), at which point it returns the current value of \( k \). The provided test cases assert the correctness of the function for \( n = 2 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( n = 4 \), and the logic aligns with these examples. Since the function handles the generation of triangular numbers and the length check appropriately, and given that the hints and examples provided do not indicate any issues, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
