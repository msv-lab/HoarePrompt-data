Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits using the formula \( k \cdot (k + 1) // 2 \). The while loop ensures that the function continues to iterate until it finds a triangular number with the desired number of digits, and the provided assertions confirm its correctness for the given test cases. The output hints indicate that the function handles valid positive integer inputs as expected and does not explicitly address invalid inputs like non-positive integers or non-integers, which aligns with the assumption that valid inputs will be provided. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
