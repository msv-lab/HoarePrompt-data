Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies that the function correctly computes the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by incrementally increasing `k` until the condition `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` is met. The function returns the value of `k` at this point, which is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is exactly `n`. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since no edge cases or other inputs have been identified where the program fails to meet the requirements, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation, the program is correct.
