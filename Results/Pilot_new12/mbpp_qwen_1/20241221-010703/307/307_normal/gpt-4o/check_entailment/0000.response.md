Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The formula used for generating triangular numbers is accurate, and the loop continues until the condition of having `n` digits is met. Given the assertions provided in the examples, the function returns the correct values for the specified inputs. Since no edge cases or other inputs have been identified where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
