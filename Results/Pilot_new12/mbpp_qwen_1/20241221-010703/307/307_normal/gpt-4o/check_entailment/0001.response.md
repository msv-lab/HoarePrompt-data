Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The formula used for generating triangular numbers is correct, and the loop continues until a triangular number with the specified number of digits is found. Given the test cases:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which is the 14th triangular number.
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which is the 45th triangular number.

The function passes these test cases and the logic appears sound for finding the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues identified that would make the function incorrect for other inputs.
