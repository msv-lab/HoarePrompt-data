Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is given by the formula \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), where `k` is a positive integer.

2. **Loop Execution**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through increasing values of `k` until it finds the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. The loop increments `k` by 1 each time, ensuring that all possible values of `k` are checked.

3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It then checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number equals `n`.

4. **Return Value**: Once the condition is met, the function returns the current value of `k`, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program assumes valid inputs (positive integers). Even though the problem description does not explicitly mention handling invalid inputs, the program is correctly focused on finding the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, which satisfies the requirement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, making it correct.
