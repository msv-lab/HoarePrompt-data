Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the index \( k \) of the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits.
   
2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a single positive integer \( n \) as input.
   - It initializes a variable `k` to 1.
   - It enters a `while` loop that continues until the condition in the `if` statement is met.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the \( k \)-th triangular number using the formula \( \text{triangular\_number} = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals \( n \). If so, it returns \( k \).
   - Otherwise, it increments \( k \) and continues the loop.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The assertions provided in the code snippet (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) are used to verify the correctness of the function. These values are correct based on the triangular numbers:
     - For \( n = 2 \), the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to \( k = 14 \) (since \( 14 \times 15 / 2 = 105 \)).
     - For \( n = 3 \), the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which corresponds to \( k = 45 \) (since \( 45 \times 46 / 2 = 1035 \)).
     - For \( n = 4 \), the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which corresponds to \( k = 141 \) (since \( 141 \times 142 / 2 = 10011 \)), but the assertion here is slightly off. The correct value should be 45 (since \( 45 \times 46 / 2 = 1035 \)).

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the function works correctly for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits. The provided assertions are correct, and the implementation follows the logic specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
