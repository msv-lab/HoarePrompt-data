The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is exactly `n`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range, the function will eventually exit the infinite loop (due to the increment of `k`), and the return value will be the last computed `k` before the loop condition fails. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-positive integers or non-integers.
