The code assigns the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2` to `triangular_number`. Given that `k` is 3, we can calculate this value as follows:  
`triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 * 4 // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.  
Therefore, `triangular_number` is updated to 6. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 6**
