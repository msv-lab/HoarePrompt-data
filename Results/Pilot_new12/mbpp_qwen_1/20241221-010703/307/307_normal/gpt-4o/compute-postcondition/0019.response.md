Functionality: **The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is exactly `n`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range, the function will eventually exit the infinite loop (due to the increment of `k`), and the return value will be the last computed `k` before the loop condition fails. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-positive integers or non-integers.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because the first triangular number (1) has a length of 1.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to increment `k` until it finds a triangular number whose length matches `n`, or the loop effectively exits due to reaching a point where further increments of `k` would result in triangular numbers too large to have a length of `n`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly check for invalid input types or values (e.g., non-positive integers). If an invalid input is provided, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.
- The function does not have a clear upper limit for `k`, which could potentially lead to an infinite loop if `n` is very large and no suitable `k` can be found. However, in practice, this scenario is unlikely due to the nature of triangular numbers growing exponentially.
