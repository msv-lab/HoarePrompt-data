`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. The precondition stating that if the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` equals `n`, the function returns 2, is still valid but does not affect the current state since no return statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.**
