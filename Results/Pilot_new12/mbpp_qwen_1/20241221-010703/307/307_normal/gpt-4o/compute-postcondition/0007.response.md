According to the code, the `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions given to exit the loop, we only need to adjust the states that need to be true for the loop to proceed.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 2.
- `triangular_number` is 1.
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must eventually become equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` will eventually match `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must eventually be equal to `n`**
