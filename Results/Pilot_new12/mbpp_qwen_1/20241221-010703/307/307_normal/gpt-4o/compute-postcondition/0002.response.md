The code calculates the triangular number for `k` and assigns it to the variable `triangular_number`. Given that `k` is initially 1, the triangular number for `k = 1` is `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which equals `1`.

So, `triangular_number` is set to `1`, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
