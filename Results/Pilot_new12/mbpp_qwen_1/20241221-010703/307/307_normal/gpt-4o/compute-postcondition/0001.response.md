Step-by-step analysis:

1. The `while True` loop will always execute as long as the condition is `True`.
2. Since the condition is always true, the loop will definitely execute at least once regardless of the current state of the variables.

Given that no conditions depend on the variables `n` or `k` within the loop, and since the loop is `while True`, we do not need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1**
