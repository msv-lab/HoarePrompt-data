`k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` is 3, so after the code execution, `k` becomes 4. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` and its relation to `n` do not affect the value of `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 4**
