Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `triangular_number` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` equals `n`, the function returns 2. Otherwise, no specific changes occur to the variables, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` remains equal to `n`.***
