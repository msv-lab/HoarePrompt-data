According to the code, the loop `while True:` runs indefinitely and will always execute again unless explicitly stopped. Given that no conditions depend on `n` or `k` (other than `k` being 3) to determine whether the loop should continue, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that the loop can continue executing, which it can do without any changes to the given states.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**
