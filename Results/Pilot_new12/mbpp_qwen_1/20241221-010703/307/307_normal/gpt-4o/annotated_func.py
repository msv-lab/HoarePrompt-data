#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`, and `triangular_number` is the triangular number corresponding to this `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is exactly `n`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range, the function will eventually exit the infinite loop (due to the increment of `k`), and the return value will be the last computed `k` before the loop condition fails. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-positive integers or non-integers.
