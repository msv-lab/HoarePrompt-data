Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The output hints further confirm this by stating that the function iterates starting from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, where `triangular_num` is calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer and returns the correct result for each such case, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
