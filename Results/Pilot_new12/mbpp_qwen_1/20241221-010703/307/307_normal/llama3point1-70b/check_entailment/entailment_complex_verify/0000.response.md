Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations support this by explicitly stating the state of the program at different points and confirming that the function behaves as intended. The program starts with `idx = 1` and iteratively checks each triangular number until it finds one with at least `n` digits, then returns the index `idx`. The annotations also confirm that the function correctly handles various cases, including the smallest possible triangular numbers for different digit counts. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
