Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined by the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The function iteratively increases the index `idx` until the triangular number has `n` digits, which it then returns. This approach ensures that the function will find the correct index for any positive integer `n`. Since the function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer and returns the correct result for each such case, the program is correct.
