Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` is defined to accept a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer (as per the problem description).
   
2. **Initialization and Loop Logic**:
   - The variable `idx` is initialized to 1, representing the index of the triangular numbers.
   - A `while` loop runs indefinitely (`while True`) until the desired condition is met.
   - Inside the loop, the `idx`-th triangular number is computed using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
   - The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is checked against `n`.
   - If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop exits, and the current value of `idx` is returned.
   - Otherwise, `idx` is incremented, and the loop continues.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop ensures that the first time `len(str(triangular_num))` meets or exceeds `n`, the loop terminates and the corresponding `idx` is returned. This guarantees that the function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is at least `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the function correctly returns `1` because the first triangular number (1) has a string length of 1.
   - For larger values of `n`, the function continues incrementing `idx` until the condition is satisfied, ensuring the smallest possible `idx` is returned.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the required functionality without any logical errors or omissions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
