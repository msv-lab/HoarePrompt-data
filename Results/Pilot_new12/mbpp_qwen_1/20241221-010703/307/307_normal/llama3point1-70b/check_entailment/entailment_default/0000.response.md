Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. The function iterates starting from `idx = 1` and checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number (`idx * (idx + 1) // 2`) is at least `n`. If the condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`. The logic ensures that the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is found, and the function works for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The code handles all potential cases as specified, and the output hints align with the implementation.
