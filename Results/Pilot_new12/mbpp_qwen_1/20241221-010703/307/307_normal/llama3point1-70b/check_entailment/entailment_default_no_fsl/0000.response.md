Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It starts with `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is at least `n`. The function uses the formula for the `n`-th triangular number, `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and checks the length of this number to determine if it meets the requirement. Since the problem description and the output hints clearly state that the function should work for every potential case of `n`, and the provided code satisfies this requirement without any logical errors or edge cases missed, the function is correct.
