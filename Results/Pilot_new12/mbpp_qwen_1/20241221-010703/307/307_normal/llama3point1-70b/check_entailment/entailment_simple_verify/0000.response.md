Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations confirm that for a given positive integer `n`, the program will iteratively calculate triangular numbers until it finds one with at least `n` digits, and then return the corresponding index. The provided examples and the general logic of the code align with the problem description. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
