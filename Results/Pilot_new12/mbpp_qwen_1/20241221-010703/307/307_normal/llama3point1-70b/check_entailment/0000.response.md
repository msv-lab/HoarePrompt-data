Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, given by the formula \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). The program iteratively checks each triangular number until it finds one with at least `n` digits, then returns the index `k`.

To validate this, consider the following:
- For `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number is 1 (index 1).
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number is 10 (index 4).
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number is 105 (index 14).

The program handles these cases correctly and will continue to do so for any positive integer `n`. There are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws in the given implementation.
