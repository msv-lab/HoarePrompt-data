Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The provided output hints further clarify that the function starts from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, which accurately describes the intended behavior. The program handles various cases as indicated, such as `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 3`, and there are no logical flaws or edge cases that would render the program incorrect based on the problem description and the given output hints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
