Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates, incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. At that point, it returns the current value of `idx`, which is indeed the smallest such index. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the necessary conditions throughout its execution, ensuring that the returned value is correct for any valid positive integer `n`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
