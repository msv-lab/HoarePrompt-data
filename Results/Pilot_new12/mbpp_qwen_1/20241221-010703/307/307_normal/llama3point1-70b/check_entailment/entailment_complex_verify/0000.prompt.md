You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, given by the formula \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). The program iteratively checks each triangular number until it finds one with at least `n` digits, then returns the index `k`.

To validate this, consider the following:
- For `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number is 1 (index 1).
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number is 10 (index 4).
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number is 105 (index 14).

The program handles these cases correctly and will continue to do so for any positive integer `n`. There are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws in the given implementation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `idx` is at least `n`, and `triangular_num` is the triangular number corresponding to `idx`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is at least `n`. The function iterates starting from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, where `triangular_num` is calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. If `n` is 1, the function returns `idx` as 1 because the first triangular number (1) has a string length of 1. For larger values of `n`, the function continues incrementing `idx` until the condition is satisfied, returning the resulting `idx`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
