Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates starting from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. This matches the problem description, which asks for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and its corresponding index. The function handles all cases where `n` is a positive integer and correctly returns the smallest index `idx` satisfying the condition. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
