Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `idx` is initialized to 1, representing the first triangular number.
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `while True` loop continues indefinitely until a condition is met to break out of the loop.
   - Inside the loop, `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx} \times (\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \).
   - The condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:` checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is at least `n` digits.
   - If this condition is true, the function returns `idx`, which is the smallest index such that the corresponding triangular number has `n` digits.
   - If the condition is false, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to check the next triangular number.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop ensures that the smallest `idx` is found such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `idx` is at least `n` digits.

Given the problem description, the function correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by incrementally checking each triangular number until the condition is met. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and hence the correctness is **True**.
