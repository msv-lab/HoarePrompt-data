Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is at least `n`. The function iterates starting from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, where `triangular_num` is calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. If `n` is 1, the function returns `idx` as 1 because the first triangular number (1) has a string length of 1. For larger values of `n`, the function continues incrementing `idx` until the condition is satisfied, returning the resulting `idx`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function correctly returns `idx` as 1 since the first triangular number (1) meets the length requirement.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to increment `idx` until the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is at least `n`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations and return postconditions indicate that the function can return `idx` as 1, 2, or 3 specifically. However, the actual implementation only ensures that the function will return `idx` when the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number meets or exceeds `n`. It does not explicitly limit the return to only these specific values. Therefore, the function could potentially return a larger value of `idx` based on the input `n`.
