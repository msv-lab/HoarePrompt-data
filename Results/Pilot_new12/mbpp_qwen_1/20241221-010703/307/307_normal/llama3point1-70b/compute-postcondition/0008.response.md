`triangular_num` is assigned the value `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state where `idx` is 2, the calculation becomes `2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 * 3 // 2`, resulting in `3`. Therefore, `triangular_num` is updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
