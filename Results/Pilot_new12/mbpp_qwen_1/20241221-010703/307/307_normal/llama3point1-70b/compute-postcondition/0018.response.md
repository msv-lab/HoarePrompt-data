The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. Based on the value of `n`, the function returns:

- `idx` which is 1,
- `idx` which is 2,
- or `idx` which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `idx` with one of the values 1, 2, or 3 depending on the input.
