`idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is "6") is 1, and since `n` is greater than 1, the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is not met, so the function does not return anything. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6**
