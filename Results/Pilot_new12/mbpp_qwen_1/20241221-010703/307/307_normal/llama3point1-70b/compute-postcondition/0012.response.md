According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will execute indefinitely as long as there are no break statements or other exit conditions within the loop. Since the loop will always execute again, no state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
