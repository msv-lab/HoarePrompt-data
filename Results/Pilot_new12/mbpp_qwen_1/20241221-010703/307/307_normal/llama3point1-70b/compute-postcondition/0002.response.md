The code calculates the triangular number for `idx`, which is assigned to the variable `triangular_num`. Given that `idx` is 1, the triangular number is calculated as `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which equals 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `idx` is 1; `triangular_num` is 1**
