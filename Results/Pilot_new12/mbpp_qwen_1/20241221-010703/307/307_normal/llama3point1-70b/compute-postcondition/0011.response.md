The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 2, so after executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` becomes 3. The precondition that the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n` is not met because the code did not return anything. Therefore, the value of `idx` is updated, and the precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3.**
