The code assigns the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` to `triangular_num`. Given the initial state where `idx` is 3, the value of `triangular_num` is calculated as `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which is `3 * 4 // 2 = 6`. The values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
