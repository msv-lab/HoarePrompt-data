According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial values of the variables.

Right before the loop, we know that:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `idx` is 1

Since it's a `while True` loop, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute at least one time. The loop will continue to execute indefinitely.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `idx` is 1**
