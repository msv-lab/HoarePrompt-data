Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx` which is 3. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or the postcondition remains the same as the precondition).***
