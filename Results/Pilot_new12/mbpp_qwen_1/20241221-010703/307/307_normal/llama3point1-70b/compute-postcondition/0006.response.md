`idx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 1, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
