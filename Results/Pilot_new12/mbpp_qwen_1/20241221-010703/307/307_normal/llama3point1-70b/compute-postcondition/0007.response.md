According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

However, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem statement to ensure that the loop continues to meet its criteria. The current state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `idx` is 2
- `triangular_num` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) < n` must remain true. Since `triangular_num` is currently 1, its string representation is "1", which has a length of 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
