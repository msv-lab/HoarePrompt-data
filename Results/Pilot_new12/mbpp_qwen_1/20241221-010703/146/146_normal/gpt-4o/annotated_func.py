#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list. `max_len` is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` references the list that has the maximum length.
    return max_len, max_list
    #`The program returns max_len which is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, and max_list which references the list that has the maximum length`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the maximum length and stores its length in `max_len` and itself in `max_list`. After the iteration, the function returns `max_len` (the maximum length found) and `max_list` (a reference to the longest list). This function handles edge cases such as when `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty lists by returning 0 for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list` in these scenarios.
