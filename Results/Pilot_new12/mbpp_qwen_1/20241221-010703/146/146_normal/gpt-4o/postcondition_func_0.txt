The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the maximum length and stores its length in `max_len` and itself in `max_list`. After the iteration, the function returns `max_len` (the maximum length found) and `max_list` (a reference to the longest list). This function handles edge cases such as when `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty lists by returning 0 for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list` in these scenarios.
