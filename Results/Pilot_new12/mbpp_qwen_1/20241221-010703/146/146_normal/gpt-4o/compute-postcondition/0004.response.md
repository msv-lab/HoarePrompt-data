The code sets `max_len` to the length of `lst`. Given the initial state where `max_len` is the length of the current list `lst`, which is greater than `max_len`, this assignment will update `max_len` to the current length of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is `lst`, and the list_of_lists must have at least one list. The current length of `lst` is equal to `max_len`.**
