Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, and the list must have at least one list. If the length of any list `lst` in `list_of_lists` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` references the same list as `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
