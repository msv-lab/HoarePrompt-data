The code assigns the length of the first list in `list_of_lists` to the variable `max_len`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `list_of_lists`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `max_len` will be equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, and the list must have at least one list remaining; `max_len` is the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`.**
