The code `max_list = lst` assigns the list `lst` to the variable `max_list`. This means that `max_list` now references the same list that `lst` references. The current length of `lst` is equal to `max_len`, which means `max_list` also has the same length.

Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`, and the list_of_lists must have at least one list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`, and the list_of_lists must have at least one list.**
