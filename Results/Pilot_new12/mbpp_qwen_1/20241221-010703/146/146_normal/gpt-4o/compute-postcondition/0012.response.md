The code snippet `max_len = len(lst)` assigns the length of the list `lst` to the variable `max_len`. Since `lst` is part of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` was previously defined as the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, this code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`. However, `max_list` remains unchanged unless `lst` happens to be the list with the maximum length, which is not necessarily the case after just one assignment.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least two lists remaining, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` references the list with the maximum length if it exists, otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
