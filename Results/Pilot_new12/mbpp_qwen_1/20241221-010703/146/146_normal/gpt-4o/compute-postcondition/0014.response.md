Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least two lists remaining, `max_len` is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` references the list that has the maximum length. If the length of the current list `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` references `lst`. Otherwise, `max_list` remains unchanged.***
