The code initializes a new variable `max_list` without assigning any value to it. This does not affect the existing values of `list_of_lists` or `max_len`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list; `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list**
