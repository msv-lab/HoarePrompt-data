Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists.
- The list must have at least one list remaining.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` references the list with the maximum length if it exists, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for lst in list_of_lists:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements (lists) left in `list_of_lists`.
2. **Variables Involved**: `lst` is a reference to each list within `list_of_lists` during each iteration.

### Current State:
- We need to determine what changes occur in the state for the next iteration.
- Since we don't know the exact contents of `list_of_lists` or the loop body, the primary change will be in the structure of `list_of_lists`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Check Remaining Lists**: After the previous iteration, at least one list is still remaining in `list_of_lists`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, the next `lst` should be the next list from `list_of_lists`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- Since we are entering the next iteration, one list is being processed.
- Therefore, the number of lists in `list_of_lists` decreases by one.
- `max_len` and `max_list` may or may not change based on the current `lst` being processed, but for the sake of determining the state before processing `lst`, these values are unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least one list remaining, `max_len` is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list with the maximum length if it exists, otherwise, it remains unchanged.**

To clearly represent this in the required format:

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least two lists remaining, `max_len` is the maximum length of any list within `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list with the maximum length if it exists, otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
