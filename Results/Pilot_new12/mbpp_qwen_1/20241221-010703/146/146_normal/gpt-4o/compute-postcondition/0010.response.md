Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, and the list must have at least one list remaining. If the length of any list in `list_of_lists` is greater than `max_len`, `max_len` is updated to this new length and `max_list` references this list. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
