Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`, updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever it finds a longer list, and finally returns the maximum length and the corresponding list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various edge cases such as an empty `list_of_lists` or lists containing only empty lists by returning `(0, [])`. All provided test cases also indicate that the function works correctly for the given examples. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
