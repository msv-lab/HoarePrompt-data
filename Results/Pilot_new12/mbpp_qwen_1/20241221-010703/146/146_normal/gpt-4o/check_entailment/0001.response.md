Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates through each list in the input, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list whenever it finds a longer list. The assertions provided in the problem description cover different scenarios including lists of varying lengths. Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause it to fail for other potential inputs, the function is correct.
