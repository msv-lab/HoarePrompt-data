Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The goal is to find the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. The annotated program includes three assertions that test various scenarios:

1. A list of lists with different lengths, including one list that has the maximum length (`[13, 15, 17]`).
2. Another list of lists with different lengths, again including one list that has the maximum length (`[10, 12, 14, 15]`).
3. A final list of lists with two lists, where one list has the maximum length (`[15, 20, 25]`).

The function `func_1` initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. It then iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the current list's length is greater than `max_len`. If so, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list. After the loop, the function returns both `max_len` and `max_list`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest list in the input and returns its length and contents. Since the function handles all provided test cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
