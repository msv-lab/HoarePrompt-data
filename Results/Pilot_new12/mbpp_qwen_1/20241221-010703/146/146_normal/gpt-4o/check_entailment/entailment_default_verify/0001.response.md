Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list of maximum length within a list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each list to find the longest one and returns both its length and the list itself. The assertions given in the problem description validate the function across different scenarios, including when the input list of lists is empty. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
