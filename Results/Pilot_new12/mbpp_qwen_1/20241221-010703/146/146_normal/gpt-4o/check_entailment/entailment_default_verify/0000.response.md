Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length from a list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as when `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty lists by returning `(0, [])`. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness for typical cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
