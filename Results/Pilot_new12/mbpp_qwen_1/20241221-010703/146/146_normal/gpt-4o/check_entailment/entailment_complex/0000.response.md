Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. This matches the requirement of accepting a list of lists as input.

2. **Finding Maximum Length**: The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the maximum length. This is done using a variable `max_len` to keep track of the maximum length found so far and `max_list` to store the list with that maximum length. This logic correctly identifies the longest list in the input.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - When `list_of_lists` is empty, both `max_len` and `max_list` remain their initial values (0 and an empty list, respectively), which is the expected behavior.
   - The function correctly handles cases where the input contains only empty lists or lists of varying lengths, always returning the longest list along with its length.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`, which is consistent with the expected output described in the problem statement.

Since the function correctly implements the logic required to find the longest list in a list of lists and handles all relevant edge cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
