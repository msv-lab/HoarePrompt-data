Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and output hints. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`, updates the maximum length and the corresponding list whenever it finds a longer list, and returns the correct length and list. The function also handles edge cases such as an empty `list_of_lists` by returning `(0, [])`. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
