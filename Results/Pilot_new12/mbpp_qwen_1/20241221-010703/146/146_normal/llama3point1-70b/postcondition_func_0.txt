The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and identifies the first sublist among those with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters. The function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`.
