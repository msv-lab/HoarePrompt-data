The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each element is a list. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist among those with the maximum length.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the length of the longest sublist (max_len) and the first sublist among those with the maximum length (max_sublists[0]).**
