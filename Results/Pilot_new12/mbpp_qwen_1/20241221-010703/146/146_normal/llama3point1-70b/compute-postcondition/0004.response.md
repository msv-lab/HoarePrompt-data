Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and identifies the first sublist among those with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters. The function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`.**

- **Step-by-step analysis:**
  - The function starts by finding the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists` using `max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`.
  - It then creates a new list `max_sublists` containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` that have the same length as `max_len`.
  - Finally, it returns `max_len` and the first sublist in `max_sublists` (`max_sublists[0]`).

- **Edge cases:**
  - If `list_of_lists` is empty, both `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]` will be undefined because there are no sublists to evaluate.
  - If all sublists in `list_of_lists` have the same length, `max_sublists` will contain all these sublists, and `max_sublists[0]` will be the first one among them.
  - If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered is returned, not all of them.

- **Missing functionality:**
  - The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. In such a scenario, it would be more appropriate to raise an error or return a specific value indicating the absence of valid sublists.
