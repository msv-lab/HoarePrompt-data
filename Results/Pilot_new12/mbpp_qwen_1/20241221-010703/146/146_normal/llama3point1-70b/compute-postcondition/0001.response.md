The code creates a new list `max_sublists` containing only those sublists from `list_of_lists` that have the same length as `max_len`. This means that the length of each sublist in `max_sublists` is equal to `max_len`.

- `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.
- `max_len` remains unchanged.
- A new list `max_sublists` is created.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each element is a list; `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list containing sublists from `list_of_lists` that have length equal to `max_len`.**
