#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #`max_len` which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]` which is the first sublist among those with the maximum length
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and identifies the first sublist among those with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters. The function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`.
