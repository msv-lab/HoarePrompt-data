Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` indeed calculates the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) correctly. However, it returns only the first sublist among those with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`), which does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the function fails to return all sublists with the maximum length as required.
