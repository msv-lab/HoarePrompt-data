Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length. However, the problem description asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]`. The maximum length is 3, and there are three sublists with this length. The function will only return the first one `[6, 7, 8]`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct.
