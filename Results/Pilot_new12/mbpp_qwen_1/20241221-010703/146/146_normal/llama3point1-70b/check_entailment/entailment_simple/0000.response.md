Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description accurately. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, rather than just returning the first one. However, the current implementation returns only `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist among those with the maximum length, instead of the entire list of such sublists.

To fix this, the function should modify the return statement to return `max_sublists` instead of `max_sublists[0]`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return both the length of the longest sublist and a list of all sublists with that length, thus adhering to the problem description.
