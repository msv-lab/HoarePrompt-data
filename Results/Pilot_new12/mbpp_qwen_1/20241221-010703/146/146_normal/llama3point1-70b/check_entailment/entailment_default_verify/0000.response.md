Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment suggests that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the maximum length and one of the sublists of that maximum length. However, the function only returns `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist of maximum length encountered, rather than returning all sublists of maximum length as the problem description and the output hints imply. The function should return `max_sublists` instead of just `max_sublists[0]` to fully meet the problem description and the provided output hints. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is not correct based on the given problem description and output hints.
