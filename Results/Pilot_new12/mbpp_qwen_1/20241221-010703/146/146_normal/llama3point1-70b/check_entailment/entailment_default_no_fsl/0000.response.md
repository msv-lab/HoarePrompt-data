Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. Instead, it only returns the first sublist with the maximum length. This does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description, which asks for the list of maximum length, implying that if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, all of them should be returned. 

For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7], [3, 4, 5]]`. The maximum length is 3, and there are two sublists with this length: `[3, 4, 5]`. However, the function would return only `[3, 4, 5]` instead of `[3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5]`.
