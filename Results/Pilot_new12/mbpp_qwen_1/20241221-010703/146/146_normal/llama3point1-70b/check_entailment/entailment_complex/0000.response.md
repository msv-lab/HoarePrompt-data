Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the problem description because it returns both the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and the first sublist among those with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). According to the problem description, the function should only return the list of sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. 

To be correct, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, as specified in the problem description. The current implementation returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, which is not consistent with the requirement to return "the list of maximum length in a list of lists."
