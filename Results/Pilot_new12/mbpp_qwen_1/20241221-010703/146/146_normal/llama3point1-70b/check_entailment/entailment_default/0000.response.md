Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. Given a list of lists, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the maximum length of any sublist and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the first sublist with that length. The code handles all potential cases correctly:

1. It computes the maximum length of sublists using a generator expression within the `max()` function.
2. It collects all sublists that have the maximum length into the `max_sublists` list.
3. It returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist with that length.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases without issues, the program is correct.
