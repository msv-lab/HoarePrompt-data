Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` indeed calculates the maximum length of sublists correctly and identifies the first sublist among those with the maximum length. However, the function returns only one sublist from those with the maximum length, even if there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
