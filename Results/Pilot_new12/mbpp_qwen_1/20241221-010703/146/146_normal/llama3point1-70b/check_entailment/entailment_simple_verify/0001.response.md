Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, we can see that the function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length. The problem description requires returning a list of all sublists that have the maximum length. The annotation `max_sublists[0]` indicates that only the first sublist is returned, which does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is still not correct.
