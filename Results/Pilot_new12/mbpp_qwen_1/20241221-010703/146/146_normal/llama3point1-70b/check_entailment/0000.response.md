Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It first determines the maximum length among all sublists and then collects all sublists that match this maximum length. The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and one of the sublists of that maximum length. This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including edge cases such as an empty list of lists or sublists of varying lengths. Therefore, the program is correct.
