Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, as demonstrated by the test cases and the annotations. The function handles edge cases such as strings with only one character, strings where the first and last characters are the same, and strings where the character is not present at all. The annotated version supports this correctness by detailing the states of the program and the logic flow, which aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
