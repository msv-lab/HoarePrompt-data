Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, as long as they are different positions. The output hints confirm that the function handles various edge cases such as when the character is not found, appears only once, or appears multiple times in the string. All the provided test cases and the output hints align with the problem description, indicating that the function meets the requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
