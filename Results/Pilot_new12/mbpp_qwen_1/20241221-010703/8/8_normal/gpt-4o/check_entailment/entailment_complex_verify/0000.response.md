Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. 

- The function uses `s.find(ch)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(ch)` to find the index of the last occurrence.
- It checks if the character is not found (`-1`) or if it appears only once, in which case it returns the original string.
- If the character appears more than once, it constructs a new string by excluding the characters at the first and last occurrences of the character.
- The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various edge cases such as when the character is not found, when it appears only once, and when it appears multiple times.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
