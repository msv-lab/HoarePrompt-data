Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Let's analyze the function step-by-step:

1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(ch)`.
2. It finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. It checks if either the first or the last index is not found (`-1`) or if both indices are the same.
4. If any of these conditions are true, it returns the original string.
5. Otherwise, it constructs a new string by concatenating parts of the original string, effectively removing the first and last occurrences of the character.

The function handles edge cases such as when the character is not present in the string (returning the original string), when the first and last occurrences are the same (also returning the original string), and when the character is at the start or end of the string.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, the function is correct according to the problem description.
