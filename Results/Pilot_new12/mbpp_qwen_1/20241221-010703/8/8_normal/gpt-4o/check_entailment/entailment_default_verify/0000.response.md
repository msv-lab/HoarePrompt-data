Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. The output hints confirm that the function handles the following cases:
1. Returns the original string if the character is not found.
2. Returns the original string minus the single occurrence if the character appears only once.
3. Returns the original string minus the first and last occurrences if the character appears multiple times.

The function logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
