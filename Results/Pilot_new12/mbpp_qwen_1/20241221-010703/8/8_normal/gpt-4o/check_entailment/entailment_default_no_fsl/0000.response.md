Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles all the mentioned edge cases:
- When the character `ch` is not found in the string `s`, it returns the original string `s`.
- When `ch` appears only once in `s`, it returns `s` minus the single occurrence of `ch`.
- When `ch` appears multiple times in `s`, it returns `s` minus the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

The logic in the function checks if the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` are equal, which would mean `ch` appears only once, and in that case, it returns the string minus the single occurrence. Otherwise, it constructs the new string by excluding the characters at the first and last occurrences. This covers all the potential cases as hinted in the output hints.
