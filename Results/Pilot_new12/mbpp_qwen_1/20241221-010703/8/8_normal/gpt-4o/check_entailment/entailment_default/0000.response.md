Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function handles various edge cases as well:

1. When the character `ch` is not found in the string `s`, it returns the original string `s`.
2. When `ch` appears only once in `s`, it returns the string `s` with the single occurrence removed.
3. When `ch` appears multiple times in `s`, it returns the string `s` with the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for these cases. The assertions provided in the program also validate its correctness for the given examples. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
