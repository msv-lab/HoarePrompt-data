Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, as demonstrated by the test cases. The annotations support the correctness of the program by detailing the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as expected under various conditions. The function handles edge cases such as strings with only one character, strings where the first and last characters are the same, and strings where the character is not present at all. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
