Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: Remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of the given character using `s.find(ch)` and `s.rfind(ch)`.
   - If the character is not found (`-1` for both indices) or if the character appears only once in the string (indicating `first_index == last_index`), the function returns the original string `s`.
   - If the character appears more than once, the function constructs a new string by excluding the characters at the first and last indices of the character in the original string.

### Key Points:
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string, which aligns with the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence.
  - If the character appears only once, the function also returns the original string, which aligns with the requirement to exclude both first and last occurrences (which would be the same in this case).

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic of constructing the substring `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are excluded.

Since the function handles all specified scenarios and correctly implements the described behavior, the program is correct. Therefore, the output should be `True`.
