Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - Remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(s, ch)` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`.
   - It uses `s.find(ch)` to find the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(ch)` to find the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
   - The function checks if both indices are valid and not the same (`first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index`).
     - If the conditions are met, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.
     - If any of the conditions are not met (i.e., the character `ch` is not found in the string, or there is only one occurrence), the function simply returns the original string `s`.

3. **Examples**:
   - `func_1('hello', 'l')`: The first 'l' is at index 2 and the last 'l' is at index 4. The resulting string is `'heo'`.
   - `func_1('abcda', 'a')`: The first 'a' is at index 1 and the last 'a' is at index 4. The resulting string is `'bcd'`.
   - `func_1('PHP', 'P')`: The first 'P' is at index 0 and the last 'P' is at index 2. The resulting string is `'H'`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `ch` is not present in `s`, both `first_index` and `last_index` will be `-1`, and the function will return the original string `s`.
   - If `ch` appears exactly once in `s`, `first_index` and `last_index` will be the same, and the function will return the original string `s`.

Given that the program handles all specified cases as per the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is `Correctness: True`.
