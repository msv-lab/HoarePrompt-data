Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version clearly shows that the function correctly handles various scenarios, including edge cases where the character is not found in the string or appears only once. The function logic is consistent with the problem description, which requires removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The annotations support the correctness of the function by detailing the state of the program at different stages and confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
