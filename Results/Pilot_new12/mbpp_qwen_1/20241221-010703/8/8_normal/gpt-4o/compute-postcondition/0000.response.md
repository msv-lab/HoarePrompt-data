`first_index` is assigned the value returned by `s.find(ch)`. The `find` method returns the lowest index of the substring (if found in the given string). If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
