The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. 

- In Case_1, if no specific indices are mentioned to exclude from the string `s`, the function returns the string `s` itself.
- In Case_2, if there are specified `first_index` and `last_index` (which are not explicitly defined in the problem statement but implied by the context), the function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the characters at those indices.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the entire string `s` unless specific indices are provided to exclude certain characters, in which case it returns a substring of `s` excluding the characters at those indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the entire string `s` unless specific indices are provided to exclude certain characters, in which case it returns a substring of `s` excluding the characters at those indices.**
