Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s` or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. Otherwise, it returns a substring of `s` where the characters at the first and last occurrences of `ch` are excluded. Potential edge cases include when `ch` is not found in `s` (returns `s`), when `ch` appears only once in `s` (returns `s` minus the single occurrence), and when `ch` appears multiple times in `s` (returns `s` minus the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `ch`). The function ensures that if `ch` is found more than once, the returned substring excludes both instances.**
