`last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence index of `ch` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The value of `last_index` will be the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
