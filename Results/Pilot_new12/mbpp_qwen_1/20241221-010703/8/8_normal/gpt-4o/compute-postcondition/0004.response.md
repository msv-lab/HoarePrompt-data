Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`. The condition `first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index` is true**
