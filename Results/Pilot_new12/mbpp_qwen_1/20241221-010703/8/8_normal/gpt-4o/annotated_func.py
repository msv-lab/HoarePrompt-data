#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`. The condition `first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index` is true
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a substring of `s` that excludes the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s` or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. Otherwise, it returns a substring of `s` where the characters at the first and last occurrences of `ch` are excluded. Potential edge cases include when `ch` is not found in `s` (returns `s`), when `ch` appears only once in `s` (returns `s` minus the single occurrence), and when `ch` appears multiple times in `s` (returns `s` minus the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `ch`). The function ensures that if `ch` is found more than once, the returned substring excludes both instances.
