The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. 

- In Case_1, if `char` appears at least once in `s`, the function returns a new string with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
- In Case_2, if `char` appears both at the beginning and the end of `s`, the function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
- In Case_3, if `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `char`, and based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`, it either removes the first occurrence, both the first and last occurrences, or returns the original string `s`.
