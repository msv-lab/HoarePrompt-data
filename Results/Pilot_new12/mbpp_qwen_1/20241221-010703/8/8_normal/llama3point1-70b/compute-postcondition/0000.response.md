The `find` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. The result is stored in the variable `first_occurrence`. The initial values of `s` and `char` are known, but their specific values are not provided. After executing the code, the variable `first_occurrence` will contain the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `char` is a single character string; `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`.**
