The code `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` updates the variable `last_occurrence` to store the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be set to `-1`. The variables `s` and `char` remain unchanged, and `first_occurrence` retains its original value.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `char` is a single character string; `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`.**
