Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: 
   - The program uses `s.find(char)` to find the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling Cases**:
   - If both the first and last occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not `-1`), the program checks whether the first and last occurrences are at the same index (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`).
     - If they are at the same index, it removes the first occurrence of the character using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which effectively removes the first occurrence since the replacement count is set to 1.
     - If they are not at the same index, it constructs a new string by removing the first and last occurrences:
       ```python
       s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
       ```
       This substring operation correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character `char`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If either the first or last occurrence of `char` is not found (i.e., `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`), the program simply returns the original string `s`. This handles cases where the character does not exist in the string.

Given these points, the program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string, meeting the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
