Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. 

- The function first identifies the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character using `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`, respectively.
- If both occurrences are found, the function checks whether they are at the same index. If they are, it removes only the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. If they are at different indices, it constructs a new string by concatenating parts of the original string, effectively removing both the first and last occurrences of the character.
- If either the first or the last occurrence is not found, the function returns the original string unchanged.

The annotated version supports these points and aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
