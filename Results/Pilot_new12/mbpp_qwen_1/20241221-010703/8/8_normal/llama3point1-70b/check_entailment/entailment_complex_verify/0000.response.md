Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies the behavior of the function, which aligns perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The function `func_1` correctly implements the task of removing the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. It handles various cases:
- When the character appears only at the beginning, only at the end, or at both ends of the string.
- When the character appears multiple times in the middle of the string.
- When the character does not appear in the string at all.

The annotated version provides clear insights into how the function operates in each of these scenarios, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
