Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles various scenarios as outlined:

1. **Case_1:** When the character appears only at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of the string but not at the end.
   - Example: `s = "helloa"`, `char = "a"`
   - The function correctly removes the first occurrence of "a".

2. **Case_2:** When the character appears both at the beginning and the end of the string.
   - Example: `s = "aelloa"`, `char = "a"`
   - The function correctly removes both the first and last occurrences of "a".

3. **Case_3:** When the character does not appear in the string at all.
   - Example: `s = "hello"`, `char = "z"`
   - The function correctly returns the original string "hello".

The function uses `find()` and `rfind()` to locate the first and last occurrences of the specified character, respectively. Based on these indices, it constructs the resulting string by excluding the first and last occurrences if they exist and match.

Since the program correctly handles all mentioned cases without any logical flaws or omissions, it meets the problem description accurately.
