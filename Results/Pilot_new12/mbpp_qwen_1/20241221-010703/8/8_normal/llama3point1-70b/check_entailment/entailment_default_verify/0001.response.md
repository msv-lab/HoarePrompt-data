Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string in all potential cases. The original assessment correctly identified that the function handles the following scenarios:
1. Removing the first occurrence when the character appears only once or at the beginning.
2. Removing the first and last occurrences when the character appears both at the beginning and end.
3. Returning the original string when the character does not appear at all.

The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected in various edge cases, including when the character appears only at the beginning, only at the end, multiple times within the string, and not at all. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
