You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #`The program returns a string 's' with the first occurrence of 'char' removed`
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns the string `s` with the character `char` removed from its first and last occurrence
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. It returns a modified version of the string `s` based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`.

- If `char` appears at least once in `s`, the function returns a new string with the first occurrence of `char` removed (Case_1).
- If `char` appears both at the beginning and the end of `s`, the function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed (Case_2).
- If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s` (Case_3).

The function correctly handles the following edge cases:
- When `char` appears only at the beginning of `s` (e.g., `s = "helloa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes only the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears only at the end of `s` (e.g., `s = "aello"`, `char = "a"`), it also removes only the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears multiple times in `s` but not at the beginning or end (e.g., `s = "helloaa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears at both the beginning and end of `s` (e.g., `s = "aelloa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes both occurrences.
- When `char` does not appear in `s` (e.g., `s = "hello"`, `char = "z"`), it returns the original string `s`.

There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
