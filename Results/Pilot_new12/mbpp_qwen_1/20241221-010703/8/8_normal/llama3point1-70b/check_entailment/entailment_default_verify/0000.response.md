Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases appropriately, such as when the character appears only at the beginning, only at the end, multiple times in the middle, or not at all. The code logic matches the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
