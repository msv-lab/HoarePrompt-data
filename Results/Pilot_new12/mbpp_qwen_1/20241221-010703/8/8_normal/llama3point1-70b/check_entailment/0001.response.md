Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string in all potential cases:

1. If the character appears multiple times in the string (more than once), the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
2. If the character appears only once in the string, the function correctly returns the string without any changes.
3. If the character does not appear in the string at all, the function correctly returns the original string.

The function handles all these cases as per the problem description, and there are no scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements.
