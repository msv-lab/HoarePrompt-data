Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's a breakdown of why the function works as intended:

- It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)`.
- Then it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(char)`.
- If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not `-1`), it checks if they are the same index. If so, it replaces only the first occurrence. Otherwise, it constructs a new string by removing the first and last occurrences of the character.
- If either occurrence is not found, it returns the original string unchanged.

This logic covers all potential cases, including when the character is not present in the string, when it appears only once, and when it appears multiple times with different positions. Therefore, the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.
