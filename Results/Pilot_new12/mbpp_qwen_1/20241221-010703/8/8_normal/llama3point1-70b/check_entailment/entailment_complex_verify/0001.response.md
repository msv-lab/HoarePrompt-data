Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string in all potential cases. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function:

1. If the character appears multiple times in the string (more than once), the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
2. If the character appears only once in the string, the function correctly returns the string without any changes.
3. If the character does not appear in the string at all, the function correctly returns the original string.

The function handles all these cases as per the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the function in handling various edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
