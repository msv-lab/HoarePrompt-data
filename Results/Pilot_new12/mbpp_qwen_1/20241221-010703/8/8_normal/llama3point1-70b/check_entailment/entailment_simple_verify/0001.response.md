Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. The annotations support the following:

1. If the character appears multiple times in the string, the function correctly removes both the first and last occurrences.
2. If the character appears only once in the string, the function correctly returns the string without any changes.
3. If the character does not appear in the string at all, the function correctly returns the original string.

The function handles all these cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
