#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #`The program returns a string 's' with the first occurrence of 'char' removed`
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns the string `s` with the character `char` removed from its first and last occurrence
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. It returns a modified version of the string `s` based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`.

- If `char` appears at least once in `s`, the function returns a new string with the first occurrence of `char` removed (Case_1).
- If `char` appears both at the beginning and the end of `s`, the function returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed (Case_2).
- If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s` (Case_3).

The function correctly handles the following edge cases:
- When `char` appears only at the beginning of `s` (e.g., `s = "helloa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes only the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears only at the end of `s` (e.g., `s = "aello"`, `char = "a"`), it also removes only the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears multiple times in `s` but not at the beginning or end (e.g., `s = "helloaa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes the first occurrence.
- When `char` appears at both the beginning and end of `s` (e.g., `s = "aelloa"`, `char = "a"`), it removes both occurrences.
- When `char` does not appear in `s` (e.g., `s = "hello"`, `char = "z"`), it returns the original string `s`.

There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
