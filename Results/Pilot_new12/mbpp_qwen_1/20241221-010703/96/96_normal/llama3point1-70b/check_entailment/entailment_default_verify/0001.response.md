Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. The use of a set to collect unique types ensures that if the set contains only one type, all elements share the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the function, confirming that it covers all potential cases, including handling an empty tuple (which would still return `True` as per the logic). Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
