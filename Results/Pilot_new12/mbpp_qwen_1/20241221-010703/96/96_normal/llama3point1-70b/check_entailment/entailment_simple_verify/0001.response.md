Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function returns `True` if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same type and `False` otherwise. The explanation given in the original assessment accurately describes the logic and confirms that the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
