Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It iterates through each element in the tuple, determines the type of each element, collects these types into a set, and then checks if the set has only one unique type. This method ensures that the function works for all potential cases, including empty tuples and tuples with various data types. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
