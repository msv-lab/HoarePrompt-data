Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
2. **Core Logic**: The function uses a set comprehension to collect the types of each element in the tuple `tup`. It then checks if the size of this set is 1. 
   - If all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the set will contain only one unique type.
   - If there are different data types among the elements, the set will contain more than one unique type.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the set size is 1 (indicating all elements have the same type), and `False` otherwise.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
