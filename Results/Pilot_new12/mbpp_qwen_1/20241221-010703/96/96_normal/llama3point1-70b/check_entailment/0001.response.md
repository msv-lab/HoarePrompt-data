Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to determine if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. This approach is correct because:

- It iterates through each element in the tuple using a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)`.
- The `set` is used to collect the unique types found in the tuple.
- If all elements have the same type, the length of the set will be 1; otherwise, it will be greater than 1.

This logic correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple share the same data type, covering all potential cases without missing any. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
