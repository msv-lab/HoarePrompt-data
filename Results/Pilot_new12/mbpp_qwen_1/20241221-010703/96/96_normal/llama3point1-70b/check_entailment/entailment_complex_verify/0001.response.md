Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each element in the tuple, converts each element to its type using `type(x)`, and then uses a set to determine if all these types are the same. If the set contains only one unique type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. If the set contains more than one unique type, the function returns `False`. This logic is sound and covers all potential cases, including tuples with no elements, which would return `True` since there are no differing types. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is correct.
