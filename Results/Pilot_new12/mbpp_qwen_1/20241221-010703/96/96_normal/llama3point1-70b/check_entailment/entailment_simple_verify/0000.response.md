Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations support this by indicating that the function returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type and `False` otherwise. The method described in the original assessment is valid: it iterates through each element in the tuple, determines the type of each element, collects these types into a set, and checks if the set has only one unique type. This approach works for all potential cases, including empty tuples and tuples with various data types. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, thus maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
