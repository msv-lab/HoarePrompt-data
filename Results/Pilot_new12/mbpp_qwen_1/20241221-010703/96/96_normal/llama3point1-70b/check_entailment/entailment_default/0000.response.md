Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts these types into a set, and then checks if the set contains only one unique type. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty tuple (which would return `True` since there are no differing types) and handles any type of elements within the tuple. The output hints also confirm that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
