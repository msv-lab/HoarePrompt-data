Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. It does this by converting each element in the tuple to its type using `type(x)` and then converting the resulting set of types to a set. Since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, if the set contains only one unique type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program handles all potential cases:
- If the tuple is empty, the expression `type(x) for x in tup` will not raise an error because there are no elements to iterate over, and the length of an empty set is `0`, which is considered equal to `1` in the context of the function's logic.
- The function correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of different types and returns `False`.
- The function correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type and returns `True`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
