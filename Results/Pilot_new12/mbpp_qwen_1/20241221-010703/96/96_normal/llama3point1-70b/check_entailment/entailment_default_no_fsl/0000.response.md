Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts this to a set to remove duplicates, and then checks if the length of this set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty tuple (which would result in an empty set and thus `True`), and handles any type of elements within the tuple. The output hints accurately describe the functionality and do not indicate any missing or incorrect cases.
