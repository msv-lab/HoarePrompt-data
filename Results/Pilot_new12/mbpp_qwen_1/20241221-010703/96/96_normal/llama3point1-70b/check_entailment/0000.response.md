Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a set to store the unique types of elements in the tuple and then checks if the size of the set is 1. This approach is correct because:

- It iterates through each element in the tuple.
- It determines the type of each element.
- It collects these types into a set.
- It checks if the set has only one unique type, which indicates that all elements have the same type.

This method works for all potential cases, including empty tuples and tuples with various data types. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.
