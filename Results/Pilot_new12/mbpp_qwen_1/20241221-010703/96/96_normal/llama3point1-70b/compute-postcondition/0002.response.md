Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function achieves this by converting each element in the tuple to its type using `type(x)` and then converting the resulting set of types to a set. If the set contains only one unique type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. If the set contains more than one unique type, the function returns `False`. This process covers all potential cases, including tuples with no elements (returning `True`), and handles any type of elements within the tuple.**
