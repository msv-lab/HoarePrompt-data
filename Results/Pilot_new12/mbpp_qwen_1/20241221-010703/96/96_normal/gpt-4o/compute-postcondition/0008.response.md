Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `element` is the first element of `tup`, and the type of `element` is `first_type`.

2. **For Loop**: The for loop iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`.

3. **Current Iteration**: After the previous iteration, `element` was set to the first element of `tup`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next element in the tuple `tup`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `tup` is a non-empty tuple, there must be at least one more element after the first element.
   - `element` should now be set to the second element of `tup`.
   - The type of `element` remains `first_type` as long as the next element in the tuple is of the same type.

6. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, `element` must be set to the second element of `tup`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `element` is the second element of `tup`, and the type of `element` is `first_type`**
