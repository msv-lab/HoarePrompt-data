According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tup`. The loop iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `element` is the second element of `tup`, and the type of `element` is `first_type`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current `element` should be the third element of `tup`, and it should also be of type `first_type`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `tup` remains a non-empty tuple.
- `element` becomes the third element of `tup`.
- The type of `element` must still be `first_type`.

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `element` is the third element of `tup`, and the type of `element` is `first_type`**
