Output State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, and all elements in `tup` have the same type as `first_type`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `tup` is a non-empty tuple, and `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`.

2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `tup` and checks if the type of the current element is the same as `first_type`. If any element is found to be of a different type, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Output State Analysis**:
   - After the loop executes for the first time, `element` is the first element of `tup`, and its type is checked against `first_type`.
   - After the loop executes for the second time, `element` is the second element of `tup`, and its type is checked against `first_type`.
   - This pattern continues until the loop has checked all elements in `tup`.

4. **Final Condition**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all elements in `tup` have the same type as `first_type`. If the loop encounters an element of a different type, the function returns `False` immediately, and the loop does not complete.

Thus, the final output state indicates that all elements in `tup` must have the same type as `first_type` for the loop to execute successfully without returning `False`.
