Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element as a reference and compares the type of each subsequent element against it. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness for various scenarios. The output hints further support this understanding, indicating that the function behaves as expected for both empty tuples and non-empty tuples where all elements share the same data type.
