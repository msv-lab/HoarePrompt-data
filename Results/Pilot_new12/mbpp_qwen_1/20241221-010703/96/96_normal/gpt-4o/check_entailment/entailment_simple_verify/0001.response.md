Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The annotations support the correctness of the function as follows:

1. The function handles the case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, which aligns with the requirement.
2. For non-empty tuples, the function correctly identifies the type of the first element and checks if all other elements match this type.
3. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
   - An empty tuple returns `True`.
   - A tuple with elements of the same type (integers) returns `True`.
   - A tuple with elements of different types (an integer and a string) returns `False`.

Given that the function behaves as expected according to the annotations and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
