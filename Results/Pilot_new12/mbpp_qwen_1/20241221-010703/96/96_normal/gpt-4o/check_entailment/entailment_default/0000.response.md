Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles both empty tuples and non-empty tuples effectively. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, indicating that there are no elements to check, and thus, by default, they all have the same "default" type (which is `NoneType` for an empty tuple, but this is irrelevant since the condition is met). For non-empty tuples, it compares the type of the first element with the type of each subsequent element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given examples.
