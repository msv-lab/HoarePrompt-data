Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations support this by detailing how the function processes the tuple:

1. If the tuple is empty, the function immediately returns `True`, which aligns with the problem description.
2. If the tuple is not empty, the function determines the type of the first element and then iterates through the rest of the tuple to ensure all elements match this type.
3. If any element does not match the type of the first element, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements include an integer and a string.
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
