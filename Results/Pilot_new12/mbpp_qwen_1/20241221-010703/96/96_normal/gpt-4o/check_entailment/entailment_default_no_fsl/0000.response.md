Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles the case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`. For non-empty tuples, it compares the type of each element to the type of the first element and returns `False` if any element has a different type. This approach correctly identifies tuples with homogeneous types and those with heterogeneous types. All provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs.
