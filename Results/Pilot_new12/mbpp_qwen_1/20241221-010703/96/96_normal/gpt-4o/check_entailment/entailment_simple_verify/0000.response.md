Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations clearly show that the function behaves as expected:

1. For the input `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)`, the function returns `True` because all elements are integers.
2. For the input `(1, 2, '4')`, the function returns `False` because one element is an integer and another is a string.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)`, the function returns `True` because all elements are integers.

The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type (none). The for loop iterates through each element, comparing its type to the type of the first element. If any element has a different type, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
