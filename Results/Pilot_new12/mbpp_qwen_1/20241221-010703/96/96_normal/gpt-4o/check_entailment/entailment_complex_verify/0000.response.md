Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element as a reference and compares the type of each subsequent element against it. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness for various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
