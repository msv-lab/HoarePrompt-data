Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. It handles the edge case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because there are no elements to compare. The function iterates through the tuple, comparing the type of each element with the type of the first element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. If all elements are of the same type, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including an empty tuple, a tuple with elements of the same type, and a tuple with elements of different types, all of which produce the expected results. The output hints also align with the functionality of the code. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
