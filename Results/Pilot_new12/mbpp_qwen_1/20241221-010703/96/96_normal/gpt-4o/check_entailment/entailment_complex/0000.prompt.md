You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: tup is a tuple, and tup is not an empty tuple
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a non-empty tuple, and all elements in `tup` have the same type as `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It checks whether `tup` is an empty tuple or not. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it proceeds to check if all elements in `tup` are of the same type as the first element. If any element in `tup` is of a different type, it returns `False`. If all elements are of the same type, it returns `True`. Therefore, the function returns `True` if `tup` is either empty or all elements are of the same type, and `False` otherwise.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
