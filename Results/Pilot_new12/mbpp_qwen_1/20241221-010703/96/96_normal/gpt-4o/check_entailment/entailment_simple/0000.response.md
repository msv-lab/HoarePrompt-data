Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Empty Tuple Handling**: The function starts by checking if the tuple is empty using `if (not tup)`. If the tuple is empty, it immediately returns `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially satisfies the condition of having the same data type for all elements (since there are no elements).

2. **Type Checking**: For non-empty tuples, the function initializes `first_type` with the type of the first element. It then iterates over each element in the tuple, comparing its type to `first_type`. If any element's type differs from `first_type`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it continues the iteration and finally returns `True` once all elements have been checked and found to match the initial type.

3. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The function correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple share the same data type. It handles both empty and non-empty tuples appropriately and ensures uniformity of types within the tuple.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
