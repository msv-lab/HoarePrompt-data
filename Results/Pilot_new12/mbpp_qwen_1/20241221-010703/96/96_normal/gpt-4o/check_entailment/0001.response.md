Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`. For non-empty tuples, it compares the type of each element with the type of the first element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- An empty tuple returns `True`.
- A tuple with elements of the same type (integers) returns `True`.
- A tuple with elements of different types (an integer and a string) returns `False`.

Given these observations, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
