Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
   - It first checks if the tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, as per the problem description.
   - If the tuple is not empty, it determines the type of the first element (`first_type`).
   - It then iterates through each element in the tuple, checking if its type matches `first_type`.
     - If any element does not match, the function immediately returns `False`.
     - If all elements match, the function returns `True`.

The program correctly handles both cases:
- An empty tuple: It returns `True` as specified.
- A non-empty tuple: It ensures all elements have the same data type by comparing the type of each element with the type of the first element.

Given the provided test cases:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True` (all integers)
- `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False` (mixture of integer and string)
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True` (all integers)

The function behaves as expected in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
