Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element as a reference and compares the type of each subsequent element against it. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness for various scenarios.
