The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, in which case the function also returns `False`. The function does not handle lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.
