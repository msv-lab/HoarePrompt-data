#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is the last value of `i` evaluated during the loop execution, which is `len(lst) - 1` if the loop executes, the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 2, and for every even index starting from 1, the element at that index is odd. If the loop does not execute, `i` remains 1 and the length of `lst` is less than 2. If the loop exits because an even element is found at an even index, the function returns `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, in which case the function also returns `False`. The function does not handle lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.
