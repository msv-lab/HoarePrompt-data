You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2 to check only the odd indices.
2. For each odd index, it checks if the number at that index is even.
3. If any number at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first test case `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` passes because all numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- The second test case `[4, 1, 2]` fails because the number at index 1 (which is an odd index) is even.
- The third test case `[1, 2, 3]` fails because the number at index 1 (an odd index) is even.

Given the logic and the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the described problem. There are no counterexamples found where the function does not meet the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, in which case the function also returns `False`. The function does not handle lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
