You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The logic implemented in the function correctly iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided in the example test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list where all elements at odd indices are odd, which should return `True`.
- The second assertion tests a list where only the element at the odd index is odd, which should also return `True`.
- The third assertion tests a list where an element at an odd index is even, which should return `False`.

Since the program works correctly for the given examples and the logic appears to handle all cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is the last value of `i` evaluated during the loop execution, which is `len(lst) - 1` if the loop executes, the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 2, and for every even index starting from 1, the element at that index is odd. If the loop does not execute, `i` remains 1 and the length of `lst` is less than 2. If the loop exits because an even element is found at an even index, the function returns `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, in which case the function also returns `False`. The function does not handle lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
