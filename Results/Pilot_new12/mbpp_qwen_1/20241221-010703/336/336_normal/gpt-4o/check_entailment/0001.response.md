Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2 to check only the odd indices.
2. For each odd index, it checks if the number at that index is even.
3. If any number at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first test case `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` passes because all numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- The second test case `[4, 1, 2]` fails because the number at index 1 (which is an odd index) is even.
- The third test case `[1, 2, 3]` fails because the number at index 1 (an odd index) is even.

Given the logic and the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the described problem. There are no counterexamples found where the function does not meet the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.
