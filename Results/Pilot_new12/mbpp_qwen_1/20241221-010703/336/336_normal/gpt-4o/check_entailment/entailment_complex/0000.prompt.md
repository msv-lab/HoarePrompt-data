You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is the last value of `i` evaluated during the loop execution, which is `len(lst) - 1` if the loop executes, the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 2, and for every even index starting from 1, the element at that index is odd. If the loop does not execute, `i` remains 1 and the length of `lst` is less than 2. If the loop exits because an even element is found at an even index, the function returns `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, in which case the function also returns `False`. The function does not handle lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True` based on the current logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
