Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided program `func_1` seems to implement the logic correctly based on the problem description, there is an edge case not covered by the original assessment and the output hints. Specifically, the function does not handle the scenario where the list has fewer than two elements, which should return `False` according to the problem description. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle the case where the list length is exactly 2 but both elements are even, which would incorrectly return `True`. The output hints suggest that the function should return `False` for such edge cases, making the original assessment inaccurate. Therefore, the program's correctness should be revised to reflect these edge cases.
