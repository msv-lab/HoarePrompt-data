Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether every element at an odd index (starting from 1) in the given list is odd. Here's why:

1. The function iterates over the list using a `for` loop with `range(1, len(lst), 2)`, which ensures that only elements at odd indices (1-based indexing) are checked.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current odd index is even using `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If an even number is found at any odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:
- It correctly returns `False` for lists containing even numbers at odd indices.
- It returns `False` for lists with fewer than two elements, as there would be no odd indices to check.
- It correctly returns `False` for lists where the length is exactly 2 but both elements are even.
- It returns `True` for lists where all elements at odd indices are odd.

Given these points, the program meets the problem description accurately for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
