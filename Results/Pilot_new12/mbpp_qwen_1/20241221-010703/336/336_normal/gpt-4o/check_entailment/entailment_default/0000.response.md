Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the list has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` for such cases. However, the current implementation does not check the length of the list, and it may produce incorrect results. For example, if the input list is `[4, 1, 2]`, the function will return `True`, which is incorrect because the second element (index 1) is even. Similarly, for an empty list or a list with a single element, the function should return `False`, but it currently does not check these conditions.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure the list has at least two elements:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

With this addition, the function will correctly handle all edge cases and meet the requirements of the problem description.
