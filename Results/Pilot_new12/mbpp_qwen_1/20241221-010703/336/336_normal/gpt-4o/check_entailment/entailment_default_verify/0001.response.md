Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The original assessment is accurate because:
- The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2 to check only the odd indices.
- It correctly checks if any number at an odd index is even and returns `False` if it finds one.
- If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.
- The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected.

The output hints confirm this behavior and do not indicate any issues with the function. While they mention potential edge cases like an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, these are valid concerns but do not invalidate the core functionality described in the problem statement. The function's logic aligns with the problem description, making the original assessment correct.
