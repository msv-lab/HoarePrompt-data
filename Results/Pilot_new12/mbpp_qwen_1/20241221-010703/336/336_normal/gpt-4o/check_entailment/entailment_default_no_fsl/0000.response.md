Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the list has a length of 2 and both elements are even. According to the problem description, this should return `False`, but the current implementation would incorrectly return `True`. For example, `func_1([2, 4])` should return `False`, but the provided code will return `True`.

To fix this, you can modify the function to explicitly handle the edge case:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

With this modification, the function should correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem.
