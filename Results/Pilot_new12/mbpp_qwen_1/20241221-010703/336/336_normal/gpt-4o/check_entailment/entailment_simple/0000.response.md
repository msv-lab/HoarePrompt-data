Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The function should check whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(lst)` iterates over the list `lst` using a `for` loop that starts from index 1 (the second element in the list) and increments by 2, effectively checking only the odd indices.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current odd index (`lst[i]`) is even using the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If an even number is found, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty or contains fewer than two elements, the loop does not run, and the function implicitly returns `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
   - For lists with at least two elements, the function ensures that all elements at odd indices are odd.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided cover various scenarios:
     - `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain odd numbers.
     - `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the only odd index (1) contains an odd number.
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the second element (at index 1) is even.

Since the function accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
