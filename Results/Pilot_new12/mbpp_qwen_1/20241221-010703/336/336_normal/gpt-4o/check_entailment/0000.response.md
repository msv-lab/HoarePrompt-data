Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The logic implemented in the function correctly iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided in the example test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list where all elements at odd indices are odd, which should return `True`.
- The second assertion tests a list where only the element at the odd index is odd, which should also return `True`.
- The third assertion tests a list where an element at an odd index is even, which should return `False`.

Since the program works correctly for the given examples and the logic appears to handle all cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is **True**.
