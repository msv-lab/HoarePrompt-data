Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function iterates over the list, checking only the odd indices, and returns `False` if any number at an odd index is even. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`. 

The provided test cases validate the function:
- The first test case `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` passes because all numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- The second test case `[4, 1, 2]` fails because the number at index 1 (which is an odd index) is even.
- The third test case `[1, 2, 3]` fails because the number at index 1 (an odd index) is even.

The annotations further clarify the state of the program, indicating that the function correctly evaluates the condition for each odd index and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the evaluation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
