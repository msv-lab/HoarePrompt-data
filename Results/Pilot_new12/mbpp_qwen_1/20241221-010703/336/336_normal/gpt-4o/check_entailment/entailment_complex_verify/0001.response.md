Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 and ensures that all elements at these odd indices are odd. The provided assertions and the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as intended. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the logic and passes all the given test cases. There are no counterexamples found where the function does not meet the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.
