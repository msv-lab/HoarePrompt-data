Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least one element at index 1, `i` is 3, the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index 1 of `lst` is odd. If the element at index `i` (which is `lst[3]`) is even, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change is made to the list and the function does nothing specific regarding the list or other variables.***
