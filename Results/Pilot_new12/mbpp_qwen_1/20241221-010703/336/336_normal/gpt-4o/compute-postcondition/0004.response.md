Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element at index 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The element at index 1 of `lst` is odd.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 2 each time (`i += 2`).
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(lst)`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, and the increment is by 2, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2 = 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which will be 3) must be less than `len(lst)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the length of `lst` is such that `i` (which will be 3) is still within the bounds of the list.
   - Additionally, since the loop condition depends on `i` and `len(lst)`, we need to update these values.

Given that `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are:
- The length of `lst` must be at least 3 (since `i` will be 3).

Therefore, the updated state should reflect this:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least one element at index 1, `i` is 3, the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index 1 of `lst` is odd.**
