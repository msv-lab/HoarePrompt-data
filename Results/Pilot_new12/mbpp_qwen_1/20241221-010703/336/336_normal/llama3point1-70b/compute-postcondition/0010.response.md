Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` is the last index processed by the loop (or len(lst) if the loop does not execute), and the function returns False if for any odd index `i` the element at index `i` in `lst` is even, otherwise the function does not return anything.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each index `i` in the list `lst`. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd and if the element at index `i` is even. If both conditions are met, the function immediately returns `False`.
- **Termination Conditions**:
  - **Even Index**: If `i` is even, the loop continues without returning.
  - **Odd Index and Even Element**: If `i` is odd and the element at index `i` is even, the function returns `False`.
  - **No Match**: If the loop completes without finding an odd index with an even element, the function does not return anything (it implicitly returns `None`).

- **Final Values**:
  - **`lst`**: The list remains unchanged.
  - **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the last index processed. If the loop does not execute at all, `i` will be `len(lst)` (since the loop runs from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`).

Given these points, the final output state reflects the condition under which the function would return `False` and the state of the variables when the loop terminates.
