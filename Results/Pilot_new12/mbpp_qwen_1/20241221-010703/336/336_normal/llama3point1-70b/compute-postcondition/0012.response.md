The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function has four possible return points, but only one of them returns `True`, while the other three return `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` under certain conditions, while returning `False` in all other cases.
