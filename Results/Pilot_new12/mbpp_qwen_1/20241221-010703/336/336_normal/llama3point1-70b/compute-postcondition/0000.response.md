State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(len(lst)):` will iterate over the indices of the list `lst`. The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < len(lst)`.

2. **Initial Values**: 
   - `lst` is a list of integers.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Loop Execution Criteria**:
   - For the loop to execute, the length of `lst` must be at least 1 (i.e., `len(lst) >= 1`). This ensures that there is at least one index in the range from 0 to `len(lst) - 1`.

4. **Initial State**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.
   - `lst` is a list of integers but we need to ensure it has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `lst` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(lst) >= 1`).
- `i` starts at 0.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
