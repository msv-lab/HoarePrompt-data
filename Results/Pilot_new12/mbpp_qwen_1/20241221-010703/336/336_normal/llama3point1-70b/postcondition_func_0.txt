The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether for every odd index `i` in the list, the element at that index is not even. If for any odd index `i`, the element at index `i` is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`. There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the code, but the function assumes that the input `lst` is a list of integers. If `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
