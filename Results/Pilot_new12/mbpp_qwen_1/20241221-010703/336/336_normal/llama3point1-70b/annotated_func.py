#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is the last index processed by the loop (or len(lst) if the loop does not execute), and the function returns False if for any odd index `i` the element at index `i` in `lst` is even, otherwise the function does not return anything.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether for every odd index `i` in the list, the element at that index is not even. If for any odd index `i`, the element at index `i` is even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`. There are no edge cases explicitly handled in the code, but the function assumes that the input `lst` is a list of integers. If `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
