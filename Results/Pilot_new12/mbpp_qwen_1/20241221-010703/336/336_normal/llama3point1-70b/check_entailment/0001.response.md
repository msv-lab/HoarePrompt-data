Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and for each odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases or inputs that would make it fail according to the problem description, the function is correct.
