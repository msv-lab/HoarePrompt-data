Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Loop through the list**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over each index `i` in the list `lst`.

2. **Condition Check**: For each index `i`, the program checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2 != 0`: This condition ensures that `i` is an odd index.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at index `i` is even.

3. **Return False Immediately**: If the above condition is met (i.e., the element at an odd index is even), the function immediately returns `False`. This means as soon as the program finds an even number at an odd index, it stops further checks and returns `False`.

4. **Return True After Loop**: If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`. This indicates that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It checks each odd index in the list to ensure that the element at that index is odd. If any odd index contains an even number, the function returns `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the program is correct.
