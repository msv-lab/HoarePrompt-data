Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, the condition inside the loop checks if the element at an odd index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). This means that if the element at an odd index is even, the function returns `False`, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. The problem description states that every odd index should contain an odd number, so the condition should check if the element at an odd index is odd (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
