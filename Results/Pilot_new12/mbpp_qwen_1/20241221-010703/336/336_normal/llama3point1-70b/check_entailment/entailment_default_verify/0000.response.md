Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The provided output hints further clarify that the function returns `False` if it finds an even number at any odd index and `True` otherwise. Since the function iterates through the list and checks the condition for each odd index, it meets the problem description accurately. The function assumes that the input `lst` is a list of integers, and if the list is empty, it correctly returns `True` because there are no odd indices to check. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
