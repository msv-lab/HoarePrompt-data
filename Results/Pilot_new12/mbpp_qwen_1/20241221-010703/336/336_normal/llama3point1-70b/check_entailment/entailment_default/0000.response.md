Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Given the problem description, the function should return `False` if any odd index contains an even number, and `True` otherwise. The provided program exactly implements this logic. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning `False` for any even number at an odd index and `True` otherwise. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the hints that would make the function incorrect according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for every potential case.
