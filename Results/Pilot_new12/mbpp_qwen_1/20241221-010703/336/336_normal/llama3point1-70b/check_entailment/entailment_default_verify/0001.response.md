Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and for each odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the output hints provided. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
