Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the list and for each odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`. The annotated version also correctly notes that the function assumes the input `lst` is a list of integers and that the function will return `True` for an empty list because there are no odd indices to check. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the annotations, thus supporting the original assessment of the program's correctness.
