Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list and for each odd index, it checks if the element at that index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Given the logic of the function, it correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
