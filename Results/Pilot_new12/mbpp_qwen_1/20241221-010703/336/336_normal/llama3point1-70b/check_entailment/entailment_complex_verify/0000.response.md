Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies the behavior of the function `func_1`. It confirms that the function iterates through the list and checks if every odd index contains an odd number. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such even numbers, it returns `True`. The function correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail under the assumption that the input is valid. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
