#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is equal to the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.
    return sum
    #The program returns total which is equal to the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even values of `i` from 0 to `n`. It then returns this sum. This calculation is performed using a for loop that iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, checking each value of `i` to determine if it is even. If `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient is added to the running total `sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the computed sum.
