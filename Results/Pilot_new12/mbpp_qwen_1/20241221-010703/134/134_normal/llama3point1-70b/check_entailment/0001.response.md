Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function iterates through all indices from `0` to `n`, checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient (`math.comb(n, i)`) to the sum. This approach ensures that only even indices are considered, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function handles all even indices correctly without any omissions or errors, it is considered correct for all potential cases.
