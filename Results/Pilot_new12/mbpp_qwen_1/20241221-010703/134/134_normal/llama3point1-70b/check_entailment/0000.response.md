Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The program iterates through each index from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum. This approach accurately implements the requirement specified in the problem description. Since the program handles all even indices correctly and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
