Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function iterates through all indices from `0` to `n`, checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient (`math.comb(n, i)`) to the sum. The annotations confirm that the program correctly sums the binomial coefficients for even indices, and there are no errors or omissions in the logic. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
