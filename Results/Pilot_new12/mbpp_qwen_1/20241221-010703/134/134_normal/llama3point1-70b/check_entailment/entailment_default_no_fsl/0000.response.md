Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates over the range from 0 to n, checks if the index `i` is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. This logic accurately computes the sum of the binomial coefficients for even indices. Since the problem description and the output hints do not specify any edge cases or additional requirements that the code is missing, and the code appears to handle all provided examples correctly, the program is considered correct.
