Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for all even indices from 0 to `n`. This is achieved through a for loop that iterates over the range from 0 to `n`, checking each index `i` to see if it is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the computed sum.

The program adheres to the problem description in all cases:
- It correctly identifies even indices (`i % 2 == 0`).
- It uses the `math.comb` function to calculate binomial coefficients.
- It sums these coefficients and returns the result.

Thus, the program is correct as per the given problem description.
