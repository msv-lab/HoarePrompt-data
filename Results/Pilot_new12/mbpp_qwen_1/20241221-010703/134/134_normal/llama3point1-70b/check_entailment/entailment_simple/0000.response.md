Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem statement assumes the input `n` is a positive integer. The annotated program does not explicitly validate this condition, but it is assumed that the input will be valid (positive integer) as per the instructions.

2. **Iterating Over Even Indices**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over indices from `0` to `n`. It checks if the index `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The variable `sum` accumulates the sum of the binomial coefficients for all even indices `i` from `0` to `n`.

4. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns the computed sum.

The program adheres to the problem description in all cases, as it correctly calculates the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for any given positive integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
