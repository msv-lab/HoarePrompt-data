Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through all indices from `0` to `n`, checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient (`math.comb(n, i)`) to the sum. The function handles all even indices correctly without any omissions or errors, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
