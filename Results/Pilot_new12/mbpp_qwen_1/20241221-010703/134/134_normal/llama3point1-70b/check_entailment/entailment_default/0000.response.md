Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through the range from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`, and adds the corresponding binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. This approach ensures that all even-indexed binomial coefficients are included in the sum. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code accurately performs the required task for every potential case where \( n \) is a positive integer.
