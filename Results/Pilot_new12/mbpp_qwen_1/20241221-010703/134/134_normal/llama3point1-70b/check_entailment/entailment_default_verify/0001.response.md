Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, checks each value of `i` to determine if it is even, and adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the running total `sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
