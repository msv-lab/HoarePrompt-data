`sum` is assigned the value of `math.comb(n, i)`, which is the combination of `n` choose `i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `sum` becomes the value of `math.comb(n, 2)`. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `sum` is `math.comb(n, 2)`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `sum` is `math.comb(n, 2)`**
