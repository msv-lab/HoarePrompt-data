According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
- Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to proceed to the next value of `i`, which would be 3.

Let's consider the condition for `sum`:
- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `sum` is `math.comb(n, 2)`.
- For `i = 2`, since `2 % 2 == 0`, `sum` is `math.comb(n, 2)`.
- This means that `sum` is already set based on the value of `n` at this point.

The state of `total` remains unchanged as it was not mentioned to be affected by the loop in the given information.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` must be 3 (the next value).
- `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
