The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` updates the value of `sum`. However, the initial state does not include a variable named `sum`, only `total`, `i`, and `n`. Assuming `sum` is being used as an alias for `total` (since `total` is the only sum-related variable in the initial state), the code calculates `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to `total`.

Given:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2

The code calculates `math.comb(n, 3)`. Since `n` must be greater than 2, let's consider the general case where `n > 2`. The value of `math.comb(n, 3)` is \(\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}\).

After the code executes, `total` will be updated by adding `math.comb(n, 3)` to its current value (which is 0).

Output State: **`total` is `math.comb(n, 3)`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
