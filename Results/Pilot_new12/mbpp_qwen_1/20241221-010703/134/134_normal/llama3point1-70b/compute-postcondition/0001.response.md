Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`.
   - This means that the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n + 1` must hold true.
   - This implies that `n` must be a non-negative integer because if `n` were negative, the loop would not execute since `range(n + 1)` would produce an empty sequence.

3. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - Given that `n` is a positive integer, we know `n > 0`.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 0.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - However, the initial value of `i` should be considered. Initially, `i` starts at 0 before the loop begins.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value).
- `n` should be confirmed to be a positive integer.

The final state should include these considerations:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
