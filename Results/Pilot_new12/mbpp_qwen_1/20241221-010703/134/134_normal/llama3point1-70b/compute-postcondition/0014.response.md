Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even values of `i` from 0 to `n`. It then returns this sum. This calculation is performed using a for loop that iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, checking each value of `i` to determine if it is even. If `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient is added to the running total `sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the computed sum.**

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0 since the initial value of `sum` is 0.
- If `n` is 1, the only even `i` is 0, so the function will return `math.comb(1, 0)`, which is 1.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the program returns `total`, but it should be clear that the variable used in the function is `sum`. This can be clarified in the description to ensure clarity.
