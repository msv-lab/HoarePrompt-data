The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. Given that `i` is currently even, `math.comb(n, i)` will be added to `sum`. Since `total` and `num` are not affected, they remain unchanged. The value of `i` will increment by 1 because the combination calculation is performed in the context of iterating over even indices, and the next value of `i` will be odd.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and sum is math.comb(n, 0)**
