The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even values of `i` from 0 to `n`. It then returns this sum. This calculation is performed using a for loop that iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, checking each value of `i` to determine if it is even. If `i` is even, the corresponding binomial coefficient is added to the running total `sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the computed sum.
