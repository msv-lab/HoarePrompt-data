Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\) to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The provided assertions (`func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, `func_1(2) == 2`) validate this implementation. Since the function returns the expected results for these test cases and the mathematical basis for the function is sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
