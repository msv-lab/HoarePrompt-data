Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The function `func_1` returns \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the correct mathematical formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n`.

The program includes assertions that verify the function's behavior with different inputs (4, 6, and 2), and these match the expected outcomes based on the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\):

- For `n = 4`, \(2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8\)
- For `n = 6`, \(2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32\)
- For `n = 2`, \(2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2\)

Since the function correctly implements the required logic and the provided assertions validate its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
