Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes \(2^{(n-1)}\) for a given positive integer \(n\). This matches the problem description, which requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function with specific examples. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
