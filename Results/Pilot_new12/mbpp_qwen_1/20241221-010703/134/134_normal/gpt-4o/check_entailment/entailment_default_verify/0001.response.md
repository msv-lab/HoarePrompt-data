Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \) using the formula \( 2^{(n-1)} \). This aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a positive integer and returning \( 2^{(n-1)} \). Since there are no additional edge cases or functionalities mentioned that the current implementation does not cover, and the provided test cases validate the correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
