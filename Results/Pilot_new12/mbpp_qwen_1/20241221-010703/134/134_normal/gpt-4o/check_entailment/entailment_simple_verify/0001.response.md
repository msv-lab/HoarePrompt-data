Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided assertions validate the function for specific cases, and the formula holds true for any positive integer \(n\). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
