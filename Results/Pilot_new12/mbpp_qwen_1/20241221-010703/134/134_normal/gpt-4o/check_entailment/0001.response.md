Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). According to the binomial theorem, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \( (1 + 1)^n \) is \( 2^{n-1} \). The function implements this formula directly, which is correct. The test cases provided (`func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, `func_1(2) == 2`) also validate this formula for the given inputs. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the formula holds for any positive integer \( n \), the program is correct for every potential case.
