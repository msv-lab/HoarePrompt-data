Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This is correct according to the properties of binomial coefficients. Specifically, the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1+1)^n\) is \(2^{(n-1)}\).

The given test cases \(func_1(4) == 8\), \(func_1(6) == 32\), and \(func_1(2) == 2\) are all consistent with this formula. Additionally, this solution works for any positive integer \(n\), as it directly computes the result without iterating through the binomial coefficients, ensuring efficiency and correctness for all valid inputs.
