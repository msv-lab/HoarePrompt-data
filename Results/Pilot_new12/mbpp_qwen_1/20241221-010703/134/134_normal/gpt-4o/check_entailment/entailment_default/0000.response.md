Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` which calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n` is \(2^{(n-1)}\). The function `func_1` returns \(2^{(n-1)}\) for the given test cases, and the output hints confirm that the function correctly computes the result based on the input parameter `n`. Since the code handles all the provided test cases and the general case as described, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the hints, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
