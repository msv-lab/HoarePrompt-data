Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n` using the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\). This matches the problem description, which requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for the provided assertions (`func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, `func_1(2) == 2`). Since the function handles the given cases correctly and the problem description is satisfied for every potential case (within the assumptions of valid input), the correctness is True.
