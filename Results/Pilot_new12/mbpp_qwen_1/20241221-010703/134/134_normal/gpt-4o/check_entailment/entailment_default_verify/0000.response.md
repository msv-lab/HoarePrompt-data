Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to calculate \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts a single positive integer parameter and returns the expected result based on the formula. The test cases \(func_1(4) == 8\), \(func_1(6) == 32\), and \(func_1(2) == 2\) are all consistent with the expected behavior. Since the problem description asks for the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients and the provided implementation matches the mathematical property, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
