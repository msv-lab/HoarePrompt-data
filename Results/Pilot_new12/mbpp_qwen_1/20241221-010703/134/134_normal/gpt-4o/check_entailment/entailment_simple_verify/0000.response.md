Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate \(2^{(n-1)}\), which represents the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The test cases provided are consistent with this implementation, and the annotated code supports the correctness of the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
