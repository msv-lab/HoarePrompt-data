Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which indeed returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` if the number itself is odd. 

According to the problem description, the function should be checking for odd parity, i.e., it should return `True` if the number is odd. But the current implementation returns the opposite, checking for even parity instead. The annotations confirm that the function currently returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. Since this does not align with the problem description, the original assessment is correct.
