Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks whether a given number `n` is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. While this condition correctly determines the odd parity of a number, the problem description specifically asks for finding the "parity" of a given number. Parity typically refers to whether a number is even or odd. However, the function name `func_1` and the comment indicate that the function determines if the number is odd.

To meet the problem description exactly, the function should check if the number is even, not odd. The correct implementation would be:

```python
# State of the program right before the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
    # The program returns True if n is an even integer, and False if n is an odd integer
```

With this change, the function will correctly identify the even parity of a number as required by the problem description. The provided assertions would then also work as expected:

```python
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(7) == False
assert func_1(10) == True
```
