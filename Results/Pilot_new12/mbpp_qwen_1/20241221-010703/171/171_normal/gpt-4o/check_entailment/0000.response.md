Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number has odd parity (i.e., if the number itself is odd), but it returns the negation of this condition. Therefore, the function should return `True` if `n % 2 == 0` and `False` if `n % 2 != 0`.

For example, for the input `12`, the function returns `False` which is correct according to the current implementation. However, for the input `7`, the function should return `False` (since 7 is odd and we want to check for even parity), but it returns `True` because the condition `n % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True`.

To fix this, the function should be modified to:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This would correctly identify whether the parity of the given number is even.
