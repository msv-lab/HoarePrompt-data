Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns the opposite of the required parity. It checks if the number is odd by using `n % 2 != 0`, which means it returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers. 

For example, for the input `12`, the function should return `True` (since 12 is even), but it returns `False`. Similarly, for the input `7`, the function should return `False` (since 7 is odd), but it returns `True`.

To fix this, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This corrected function will return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers, meeting the problem description.
