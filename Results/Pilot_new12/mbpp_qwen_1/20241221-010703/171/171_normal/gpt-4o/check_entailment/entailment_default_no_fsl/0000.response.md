Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, this does not meet the requirement of finding the parity of a given number. The problem description asks for the parity (odd or even) of a given number, not whether the number is odd specifically. 

For example, if the input is `12`, the output should be `False` (even), but the code returns `False` as expected. Similarly, for `7`, the output should be `True` (odd), and the code returns `True` as expected. 

However, for `10`, the output should be `False` (even), but the code also returns `False`, which is incorrect because `10` is an even number. The code is incorrectly returning `False` for both odd and even numbers.

To fix this, the function should check if the number is even using `n % 2 == 0` and return `True` if it is even, and `False` if it is odd. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the parity of the given number.
