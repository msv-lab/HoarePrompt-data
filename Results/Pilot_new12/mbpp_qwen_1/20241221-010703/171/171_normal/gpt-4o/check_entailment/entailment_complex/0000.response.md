Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given number has odd parity (i.e., whether the number is odd). The function takes an integer `n` as input and uses the modulus operator `%` to check if `n` divided by 2 leaves a remainder. If the remainder is not zero (`n % 2 != 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even.

The function matches the problem description perfectly, which states: "Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd." The function indeed returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, fulfilling the requirement. There are no edge cases or conditions mentioned that would invalidate this logic, and the function behaves consistently across different valid inputs based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
