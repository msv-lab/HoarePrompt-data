Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` currently checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which means it returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd. The function does not meet this requirement as per the problem description. The correct implementation should be `return n % 2 == 0` to ensure the function returns `True` if the number has even parity (i.e., if the number itself is even).
