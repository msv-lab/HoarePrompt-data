Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` as written returns the opposite of the desired result. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the parity of a given number is odd, meaning it should return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers. However, the current implementation uses `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The output hints confirm that the function checks whether `n` is an odd integer, returning `True` if `n` is odd and `False` otherwise. This does not align with the problem description, hence the original assessment is correct.
