Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. However, the function `func_1` currently checks if a number is even by returning `True` if `n % 2 != 0` and `False` if `n % 2 == 0`. This is the opposite of what the problem description requires. 

The original assessment correctly points out that the function should return `True` if the number has even parity (i.e., if the number itself is even). The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which contradicts the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and the original assessment is accurate.
