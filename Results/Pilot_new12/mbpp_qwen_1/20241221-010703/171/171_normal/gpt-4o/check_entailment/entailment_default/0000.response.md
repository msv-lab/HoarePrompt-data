Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to check the parity of a given number and return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if it is even. However, the code currently returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which means it returns `True` for odd numbers but should return `False` for even numbers. Therefore, the function is incorrectly implemented and does not fulfill the requirement to check the parity of a number. For example, `func_1(12)` should return `False`, but the code returns `True`.
