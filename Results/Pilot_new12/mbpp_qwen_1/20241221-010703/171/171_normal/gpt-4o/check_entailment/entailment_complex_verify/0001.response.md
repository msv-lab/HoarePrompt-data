Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means it should return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers. However, the current implementation of `func_1` returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, as evidenced by the annotated version of the code. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements specified in the problem description.
