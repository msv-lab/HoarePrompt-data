Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The annotated version correctly states that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. However, the original function `func_1(n)` uses `return n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. This is the opposite of what the problem description requires. The function should return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers, but the current implementation does the opposite. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the problem description.
