The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter. It checks whether `n` is an odd integer. If `n` is odd, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled explicitly, as the modulus operation `%` inherently handles all possible integer values. The function does not modify any external variables and only relies on the input `n` to determine its output.
