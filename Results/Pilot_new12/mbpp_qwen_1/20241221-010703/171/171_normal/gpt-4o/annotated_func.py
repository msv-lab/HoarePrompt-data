#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, and False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter. It checks whether `n` is an odd integer. If `n` is odd, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled explicitly, as the modulus operation `%` inherently handles all possible integer values. The function does not modify any external variables and only relies on the input `n` to determine its output.
