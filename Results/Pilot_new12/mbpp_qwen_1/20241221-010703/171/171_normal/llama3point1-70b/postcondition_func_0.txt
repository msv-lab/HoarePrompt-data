The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, and `False` if `n` is an even integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly checks whether the given integer `n` is odd or even based on the modulus operation `n % 2 != 0`. The function does not perform any additional actions beyond this check.
