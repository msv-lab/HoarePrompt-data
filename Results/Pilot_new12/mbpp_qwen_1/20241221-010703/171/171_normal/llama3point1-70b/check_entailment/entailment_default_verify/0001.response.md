Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the problem description asks for a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is odd, which is correct. However, it should also return `False` if `n` is even to fully meet the requirement of checking the parity. The function currently only checks for odd numbers and does not handle even numbers correctly, leading to incorrect results for even inputs. The output hints confirm that the function only checks if `n` is odd, and does not explicitly address even numbers, which is why the original assessment of the program's correctness being false is accurate.
