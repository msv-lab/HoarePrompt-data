Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. According to the annotated version, the program returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function handles all valid cases as specified, making the original assessment correct.
