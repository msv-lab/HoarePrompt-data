Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to check if `n % 2 != 0`, which means that the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is not zero. This condition is true for odd numbers and false for even numbers. Since the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function does not perform any additional actions beyond this check, and it correctly handles all potential cases where `n` is an integer. Therefore, the program is correct.
