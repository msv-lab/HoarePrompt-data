Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. The function returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which aligns with the problem description of finding whether the parity of a given number is odd. The output hints confirm that the function correctly checks whether the given integer `n` is odd or even based on the modulus operation `n % 2 != 0`, without any issues or edge cases mentioned. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
