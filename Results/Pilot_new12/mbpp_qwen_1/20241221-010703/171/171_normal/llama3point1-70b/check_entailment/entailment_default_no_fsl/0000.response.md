Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether a given integer `n` has an odd parity (i.e., whether it is odd). The function uses the modulus operator `%` to check if `n % 2 != 0`, which is the correct way to determine if a number is odd. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the function accurately performs this check without any logical errors or missing edge cases, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
