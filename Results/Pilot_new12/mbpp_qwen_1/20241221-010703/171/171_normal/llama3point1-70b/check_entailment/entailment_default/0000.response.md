Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given integer `n` is odd or even based on the modulus operation `n % 2 != 0`. The function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. Given the problem description to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, the function meets the requirements for every potential case. There are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned in the problem description that this function does not handle. Therefore, the function correctly implements the specified functionality.
