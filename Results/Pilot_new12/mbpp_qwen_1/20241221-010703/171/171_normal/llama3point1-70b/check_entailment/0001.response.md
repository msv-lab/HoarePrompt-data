Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd, which is correct. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. To fully meet the requirement, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. The current implementation only checks for odd numbers and does not handle even numbers correctly. For example, if `n` is 0 or any even number, the function will incorrectly return `False`. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
