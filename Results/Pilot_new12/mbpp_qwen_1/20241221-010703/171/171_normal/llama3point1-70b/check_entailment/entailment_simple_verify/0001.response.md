Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. According to the problem description, the task is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` does exactly this; it returns `True` if the number is odd (which indicates the parity is odd) and `False` if the number is even (which indicates the parity is even). Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment is not accurate because the function correctly identifies the parity of a given number as odd.
