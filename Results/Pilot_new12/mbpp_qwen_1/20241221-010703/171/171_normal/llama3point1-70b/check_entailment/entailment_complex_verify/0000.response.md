Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The provided code performs the modulus operation `n % 2 != 0`, which correctly determines the parity of the given integer. The annotations and the original assessment accurately reflect the functionality of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
