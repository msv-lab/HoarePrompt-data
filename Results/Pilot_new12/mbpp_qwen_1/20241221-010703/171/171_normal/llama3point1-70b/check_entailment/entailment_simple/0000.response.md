Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the parity of a given number as described in the problem statement. The problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which implies checking if the number is odd. However, the given program returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. 

To correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement, the program should return `True` if `n` is even (i.e., has an odd parity) and `False` if `n` is odd. The current implementation uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check for oddness, which is logically correct, but the logic in the return statement should be inverted. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This corrected version will return `True` if the number is even (odd parity), which aligns with the requirement specified in the problem description.
