Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. This condition returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. Since the program handles all cases correctly as per the problem description, it is correct.
