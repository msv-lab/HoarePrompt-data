Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(s)` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a single string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The `count` method of Python strings is used correctly to achieve this functionality. Since the input is assumed to be valid (as per the instructions), the program will always produce the correct result according to the problem description.
