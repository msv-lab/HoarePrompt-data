Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within `s`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of strings, which counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a specified substring. The function handles all valid inputs (non-empty strings) correctly and returns the expected result. Since the problem description only requires counting the occurrences of the substring `'std'` in a given string, and the provided function exactly meets this requirement, the program is correct.
