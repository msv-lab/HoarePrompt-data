Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. The function works for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty strings or strings where 'std' does not appear, in which case it returns 0. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all mentioned scenarios. Therefore, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
