Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(s)` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. This directly follows the problem description which asks to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The code handles all potential cases, including empty strings, where it would return 0, as per the output hints. Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem, the correctness is True.
