Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning the number of occurrences of 'std' in the string `s`. There are no contradictions or issues identified in the annotated version that would warrant a change in the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
