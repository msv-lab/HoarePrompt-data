Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method will handle all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences, which is necessary for correctly counting the number of times 'std' appears in the string. Since the function works as expected for all tested cases and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that need to be handled differently, the program is correct.
