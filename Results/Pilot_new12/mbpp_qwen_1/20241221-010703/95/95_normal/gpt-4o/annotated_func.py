#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the current code, and the function correctly performs the intended action. The function does not modify the input string `s` and simply returns an integer representing the count of 'std' substrings within `s`.
