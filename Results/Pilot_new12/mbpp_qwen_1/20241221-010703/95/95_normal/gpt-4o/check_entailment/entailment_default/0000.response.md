Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The function uses the built-in `str.count()` method, which accurately counts how many times a specified substring appears in the input string. Given the test cases and the problem description, the function works correctly for all provided examples. Since the function handles the problem description accurately for every potential case within the scope of the given examples and the assumption of valid input, the correctness of the program is **True**.
