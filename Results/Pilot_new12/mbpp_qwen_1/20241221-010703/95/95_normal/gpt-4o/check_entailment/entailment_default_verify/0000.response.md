Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the occurrences of the substring 'std', which is the intended functionality. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including presence of multiple occurrences, single occurrence, and absence of the substring. The function does not modify the input string and correctly returns the count of occurrences. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and there are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the current code that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
