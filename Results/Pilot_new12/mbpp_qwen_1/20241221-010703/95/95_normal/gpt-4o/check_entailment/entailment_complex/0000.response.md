Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within `s`. The assertions in the annotated program verify that the function behaves as expected for various test cases:

- It returns `3` for the input `'letstdlenstdporstd'`, indicating three occurrences of `'std'`.
- It returns `1` for the input `'truststdsolensporsd'`, indicating one occurrence of `'std'`.
- It returns `2` for the input `'makestdsostdworthit'`, indicating two occurrences of `'std'`.
- It returns `1` for the input `'stds'`, indicating one occurrence of `'std'`.
- It returns `0` for the input `''`, indicating zero occurrences of `'std'`.

The function uses the built-in `str.count()` method, which is designed to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring within a string. Since the problem description does not mention overlapping occurrences (e.g., counting `'stdstd'` as two separate occurrences), the use of `count()` is appropriate.

Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
