Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the occurrences of the substring 'std'. This approach is correct and will handle all cases where 'std' appears in the input string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including different placements of 'std' in the string, empty strings, and strings where 'std' does not appear. Since the function works correctly for all the given test cases and the logic is sound, the function is correct for the described problem.
