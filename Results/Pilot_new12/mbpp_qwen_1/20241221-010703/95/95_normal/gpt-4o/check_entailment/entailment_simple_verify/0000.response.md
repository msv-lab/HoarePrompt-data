Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The annotated version confirms that the function uses the built-in `count` method of strings, which works as intended for the provided test cases. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail under the assumption that valid inputs are always provided. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version, the program's correctness remains **True**.
