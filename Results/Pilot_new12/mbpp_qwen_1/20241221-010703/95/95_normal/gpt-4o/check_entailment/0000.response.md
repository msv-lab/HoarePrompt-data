Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the occurrences of the substring 'std'. This method works correctly for all the provided test cases and would handle any other valid input as well. Since the function behaves as expected for all the given examples and there are no obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
