Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within that string. This is exactly what the problem description specifies.

The assertions in the annotated program cover various cases:
- An input string with multiple occurrences of `'std'`.
- An input string with a single occurrence of `'std'`.
- An input string with multiple words containing `'std'`.
- An input string with only one occurrence of `'std'`.
- An empty string, which should return `0` because there are no occurrences of `'std'`.

The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which precisely counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring within a string. Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or behaviors (such as overlapping occurrences or case sensitivity), and the provided implementation adheres to the straightforward requirement, the program is correct.
