The code assigns the second character of the string `s` to the variable `second_digit`. The string `s` is a representation of the positive integer `n`, and its length is at least 3. The first character of `s` is stored in `first_digit`.

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `s` remains a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3.
- `first_digit` remains the first character of `s`.
- `second_digit` is now the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
