Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits in its string representation meet certain conditions. Specifically, it verifies that the first two digits are different and that every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) matches the first digit, while every odd-indexed digit matches the second digit. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.**

This summary covers all the potential cases and the actual logic performed by the function, including the edge case where the number has fewer than three digits and the conditions for returning `True` or `False`.
