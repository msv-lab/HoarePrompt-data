Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3
   - `first_digit` is the first character of `s`
   - `second_digit` is the second character of `s`
   - `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`
   - If `i` is odd and the `i`-th character of `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(2, len(s))`.
   - Therefore, `i` starts from 2 and goes up to but does not include `len(s)`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 3, which means the loop will continue because `i` is less than `len(s)`.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, it will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.
   - The loop will check if `i` (which will be 4) is less than `len(s)`.
   - The variables `s`, `first_digit`, `second_digit` remain unchanged unless the function returns False before this point.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `s` remains the same (a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3).
   - `first_digit` remains the first character of `s`.
   - `second_digit` remains the second character of `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.**
