Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i] != second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (None).***
