Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is odd and the `i`-th character of `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.***
