Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `s` has a length of at least 3, `i` is an index such that `i % 2 != 0` or `s[i] == first_digit`, and the current value of `i` satisfies `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i] != second_digit`***
