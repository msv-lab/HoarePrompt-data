Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If the loop executes without returning False, then all even indices `i` in the string `s` (starting from index 2) will satisfy `s[i] == first_digit`, and all odd indices `i` in the string `s` will satisfy `s[i] == second_digit`. If the loop returns False, it means that there exists an index `i` such that `(i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit)` or `(i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit)`.**
