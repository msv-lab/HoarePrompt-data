The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits in its string representation meet certain conditions. Specifically, it verifies that the first two digits are different and that every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) matches the first digit, while every odd-indexed digit matches the second digit. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.
