Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not. It verifies that the first two digits are different and that every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) matches the first digit, while every odd-indexed digit matches the second digit. The function handles edge cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
