Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a given number is undulating based on the problem description. An undulating number is defined as a number whose digits alternate between two different digits (e.g., 1212121, 353535). The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:

1. It first checks if the number has fewer than three digits, in which case it returns `False`.
2. It then compares the first two digits to ensure they are different.
3. For the rest of the digits, it ensures that even-indexed digits match the first digit and odd-indexed digits match the second digit.

Given the provided assertions and the problem description, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The output hints also align with the code's behavior, confirming that the function behaves as expected for undulating numbers. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
