Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies undulating numbers. The annotations clearly outline the state of the program at different points and confirm that the function behaves as intended. The function handles edge cases (e.g., numbers with fewer than three digits) and checks for the alternating pattern of digits as required. Since the provided test cases also validate the function's correctness, and no contradictions or issues are found in the annotated version, the function meets the problem description.
