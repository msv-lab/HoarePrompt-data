Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify all undulating numbers. According to the problem description, an undulating number is defined as a number whose digits alternate between two different digits, starting and ending with the same digit. However, the current implementation only checks if the first two digits are different and then verifies the alternating pattern for the rest of the digits. This implementation fails to check if the number starts and ends with the same digit.

For example, the number `121` is correctly identified as undulating by the code, but the number `1212` should also be considered undulating, which the current code does not identify correctly. To fix this, the code should include a check to ensure the number starts and ends with the same digit after verifying the alternating pattern.

Here is an example where the code does not work correctly:
- Input: `1212`
- Expected Output: `True`
- Actual Output: `False` (because the code does not check if the number starts and ends with the same digit)

To correct this, you could modify the function as follows:
```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s) - 1):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    # Check if the number starts and ends with the same digit
    return s[-1] == first_digit
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify undulating numbers like `1212`, `121212`, etc.
