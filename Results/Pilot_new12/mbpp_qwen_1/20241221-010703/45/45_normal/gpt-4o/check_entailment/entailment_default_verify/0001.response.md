Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a number is undulating. The output hints further confirm that the function checks the first two digits for being different and ensures that even-indexed digits match the first digit and odd-indexed digits match the second digit. The provided test cases also align with this logic, and there is no indication that the function fails to meet the definition of an undulating number as described. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
