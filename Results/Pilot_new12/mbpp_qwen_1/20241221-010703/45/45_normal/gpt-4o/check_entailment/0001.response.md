Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of two digits (e.g., 1212121, 1232123). The function correctly implements this logic:

1. It first checks if the length of the number is less than 3, returning `False` if so.
2. It then checks if the first two digits are the same, returning `False` if they are.
3. It iterates through the rest of the digits, ensuring that digits at even indices match the first digit and digits at odd indices match the second digit.

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True`, which is correct.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False`, which is correct.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True`, which is correct.

Additionally, the function handles the conditions for an undulating number correctly. There doesn't seem to be any potential case where the function would fail to meet the definition of an undulating number as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
