Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given number is undulating or not according to the problem description. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits. The function correctly identifies this pattern by checking if the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit.

The function handles the following cases correctly:
- A number with less than 3 digits returns `False`.
- The first and second digits are checked for equality.
- For each subsequent digit, the function ensures that digits at even positions match the first digit and digits at odd positions match the second digit.

Since the provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness, and no other edge cases can be identified that would make the function incorrect, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
