You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If the loop executes without returning False, then all even indices `i` in the string `s` (starting from index 2) will satisfy `s[i] == first_digit`, and all odd indices `i` in the string `s` will satisfy `s[i] == second_digit`. If the loop returns False, it means that there exists an index `i` such that `(i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit)` or `(i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits in its string representation meet certain conditions. Specifically, it verifies that the first two digits are different and that every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) matches the first digit, while every odd-indexed digit matches the second digit. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
