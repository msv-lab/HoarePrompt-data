    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If the loop executes without returning False, then all even indices `i` in the string `s` (starting from index 2) will satisfy `s[i] == first_digit`, and all odd indices `i` in the string `s` will satisfy `s[i] == second_digit`. If the loop returns False, it means that there exists an index `i` such that `(i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit)` or `(i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits in its string representation meet certain conditions. Specifically, it verifies that the first two digits are different and that every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) matches the first digit, while every odd-indexed digit matches the second digit. If these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.
