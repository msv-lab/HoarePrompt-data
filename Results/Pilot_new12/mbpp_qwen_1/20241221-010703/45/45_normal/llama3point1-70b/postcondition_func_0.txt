The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if its string representation is undulating. An undulating number is defined as one where every pair of consecutive triples in the number alternates between increasing and decreasing digits. The function returns `True` if `n` is undulating, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles the case where the string representation of `n` has a length of at least 3. However, it does not handle cases where the string representation of `n` has a length less than 3, as such numbers cannot be undulating. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and does not perform any validation to ensure this precondition is met.
