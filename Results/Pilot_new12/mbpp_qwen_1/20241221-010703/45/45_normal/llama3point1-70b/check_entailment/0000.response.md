Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks for a single instance of the undulating pattern but does not ensure that the entire number follows the undulating pattern. An undulating number must alternate between two digits throughout its length. For example, the number `121212` should be considered undulating, but the current implementation might incorrectly return `True` because it only checks a part of the string. 

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that every alternate digit is either increasing or decreasing consistently throughout the number. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False
    
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        if i % 2 == 1:  # odd index, check increasing
            if n[i-1] >= n[i]:
                undulating = False
                break
        else:  # even index, check decreasing
            if n[i-1] <= n[i]:
                undulating = False
                break
                
    return undulating
```

This version ensures that the pattern holds for every alternate digit throughout the number.
