Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the definition of an undulating number. According to the problem description, an undulating number is one where every pair of consecutive triples in the number alternates between increasing and decreasing digits. The current implementation only checks pairs of consecutive digits, which is insufficient to determine if the number is undulating.

For example, consider the number `12121`. This number should be undulating because the pattern of digits alternates between increasing and decreasing within every triple. However, the current implementation would not detect this correctly.

To fix this, the function needs to check every triple of consecutive digits instead of just pairs. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False
    
    undulating = True
    for i in range(2, len(n)):
        if ((n[i-2] < n[i-1] and n[i-1] > n[i]) or
            (n[i-2] > n[i-1] and n[i-1] < n[i])):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

This corrected version ensures that the function properly checks the alternating pattern of triples in the number.
