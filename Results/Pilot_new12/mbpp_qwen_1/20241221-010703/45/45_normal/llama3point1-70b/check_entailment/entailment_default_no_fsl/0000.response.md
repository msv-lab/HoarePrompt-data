Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the length of the string representation of `n` is less than 3. According to the problem description, numbers with a length less than 3 cannot be undulating, so the function should return `False` immediately if this condition is met. However, the current implementation only checks up to `len(n) - 1`, which means it will not return `False` for such cases. For example, if `n = 12` (which has a length of 2), the function will still try to compare characters, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
