Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the definition of an undulating number. According to the problem description, an undulating number is defined as one where every pair of consecutive triples in the number alternates between increasing and decreasing digits. However, the provided program checks only two consecutive digits instead of three consecutive digits.

The program iterates through the string representation of `n` and checks if each digit is either greater than both its neighbors or less than both its neighbors. This approach only ensures that no three consecutive digits form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence, but it does not guarantee that the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing patterns.

For example, consider the number `121212`. According to the problem description, this should be considered an undulating number because the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing in groups of three. However, the current implementation would incorrectly identify this as not being undulating because it only checks pairs of consecutive digits.

To correctly implement the undulating number check, the program should ensure that every group of three consecutive digits alternates between increasing and decreasing. This can be achieved by checking the relative order of three consecutive digits, not just pairs.
