Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is undulating or not based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. The program converts this integer to a string, which is a valid approach as per the assumption that the input is always a valid positive integer.

2. **Undulating Definition**: A number is considered undulating if its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. The program checks this by iterating through the string representation of the number and comparing each digit with its neighbors.

3. **Logic Execution**:
   - The variable `undulating` is initialized to `True`.
   - A `for` loop iterates from the second character to the second-to-last character of the string.
   - For each character, the program checks if the current character alternates correctly with its neighbors (either increasing followed by decreasing or vice versa).
   - If the condition is met, the loop continues.
   - If the condition fails, `undulating` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

4. **Final Return**: After the loop, the function returns the value of `undulating`. If the loop completes without breaking, `undulating` remains `True`, indicating the number is undulating. If the loop breaks, `undulating` is `False`, indicating the number is not undulating.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all cases where the input is a valid positive integer and meets the conditions for being undulating or not. It correctly identifies both increasing-decreasing patterns and decreasing-increasing patterns.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all necessary cases, the correctness is **True**.
