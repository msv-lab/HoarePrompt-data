The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables or conditions; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, undulating is False, and for all indices i where 1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1, either n[i-1] ≥ n[i] or n[i] ≥ n[i+1]**
