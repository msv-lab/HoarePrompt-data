The code assigns `True` to the variable `undulating`. The initial state of `n` is a string representation of a positive integer, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `undulating`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the original positive integer, `undulating` is True**
