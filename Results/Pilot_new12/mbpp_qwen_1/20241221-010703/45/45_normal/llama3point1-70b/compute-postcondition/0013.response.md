Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is i + 1, and `undulating` remains the same boolean value if the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` is true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.***
