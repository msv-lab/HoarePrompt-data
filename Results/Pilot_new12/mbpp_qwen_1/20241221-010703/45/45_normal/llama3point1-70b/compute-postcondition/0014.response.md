Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3.
   - `i` is `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `undulating` remains the same boolean value based on the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(n) - 2`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 1` from the previous loop run. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[1, len(n) - 2]`.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- **New Value of `i`:** Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (i.e., `i + 1 + 1`).
- **Condition for `undulating`:** The value of `undulating` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is now `i + 2` and `undulating` retains its previous value.

**State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is i + 2, and `undulating` remains the same boolean value.**
