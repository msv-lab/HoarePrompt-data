Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3. If there exists at least one index `i` such that either (n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]) or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]) holds true, then `undulating` remains True. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False.***
