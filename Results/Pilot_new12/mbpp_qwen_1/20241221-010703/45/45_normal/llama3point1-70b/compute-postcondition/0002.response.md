Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given:
- **State before the loop starts**: 
  - `n` is a string representation of the original positive integer.
  - `undulating` is `True`.

- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the For Loop**:
   - The for loop iterates over the range from `1` to `len(n) - 1`.
   - This means `i` takes values from `1` to `len(n) - 2`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(n) - 1)` is valid.
   - For the range to be valid, `len(n) - 1` must be greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, `len(n)` must be greater than `2`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a string representation of a positive integer.
   - `undulating` is `True`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is a string representation of a positive integer, it should be non-empty.
   - The length of `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that the range `range(1, len(n) - 1)` is valid.

### Conclusion:
The initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` should be a non-empty string with a length of at least 3 characters.

### Final State:
**`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that must have a length of at least 3, undulating is True.**

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, undulating is True**.
