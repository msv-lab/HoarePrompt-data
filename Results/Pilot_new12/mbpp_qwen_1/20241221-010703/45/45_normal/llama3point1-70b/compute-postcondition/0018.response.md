Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is `i + 2`, and `undulating` remains the same boolean value. If the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` is true, then no change occurs in `undulating`. Otherwise, `undulating` becomes `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
