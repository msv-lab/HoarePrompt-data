The code `break` does not change any variable values and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block currently active in the given snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is i + 1, `undulating` is `False`.**
