The `pass` statement does not perform any operation and simply acts as a placeholder. Therefore, none of the variables are affected by this statement. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is i + 1, and `undulating` remains the same boolean value.**
