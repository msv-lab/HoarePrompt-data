The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary where the values are comparable, and `n`, which is an integer. The function returns a new dictionary where each key-value pair (k, v) satisfies `v >= n`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
