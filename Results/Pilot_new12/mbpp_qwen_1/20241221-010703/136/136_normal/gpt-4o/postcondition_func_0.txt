The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are comparable and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`. If there are no keys in `d` that satisfy the condition `v >= n`, the function returns an empty dictionary. No additional actions or side effects are performed by the function.
