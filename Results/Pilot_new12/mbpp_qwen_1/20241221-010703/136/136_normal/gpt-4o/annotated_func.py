#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are comparable (i.e., they can be compared using >=), and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #A dictionary where each key-value pair (k, v) satisfies v >= n, with d being the original dictionary and n being an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are comparable and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`. If there are no keys in `d` that satisfy the condition `v >= n`, the function returns an empty dictionary. No additional actions or side effects are performed by the function.
