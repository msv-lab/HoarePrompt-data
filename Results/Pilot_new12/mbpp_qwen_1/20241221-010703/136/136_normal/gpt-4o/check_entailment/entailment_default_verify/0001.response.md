Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary based on a given integer threshold. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function, confirming that it behaves as expected according to the problem description. The provided assertions verify the function's correctness across different scenarios, further supporting the original assessment of the program's correctness.
