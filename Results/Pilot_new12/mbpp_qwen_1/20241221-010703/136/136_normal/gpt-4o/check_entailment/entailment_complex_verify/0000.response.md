Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version further clarifies the intended behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries where the values are greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. The function does not perform any modifications to the original dictionary and returns a new dictionary with the filtered key-value pairs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained as **True**.
