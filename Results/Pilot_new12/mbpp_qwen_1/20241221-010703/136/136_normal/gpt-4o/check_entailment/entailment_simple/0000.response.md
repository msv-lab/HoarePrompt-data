Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` to filter the dictionary. This creates a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs where the value (`v`) is greater than or equal to `n`. This directly aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should filter the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test different scenarios:
   - When `n` is 170, it correctly returns entries with values 175, 180, and 190.
   - When `n` is 180, it correctly returns entries with values 180 and 190.
   - When `n` is 190, it correctly returns the entry with value 190.

3. **Input Validation**: The problem statement assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors. Therefore, there is no need for additional input validation within the function itself.

Since the function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct.
