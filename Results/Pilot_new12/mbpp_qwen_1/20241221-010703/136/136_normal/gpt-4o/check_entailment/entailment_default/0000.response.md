Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and confirm that the function works as expected:

1. When `n` is 170, the function correctly returns a dictionary with keys `'Cierra Vega'`, `'Alden Cantrell'`, and `'Pierre Cox'`.
2. When `n` is 180, the function correctly returns a dictionary with keys `'Alden Cantrell'` and `'Pierre Cox'`.
3. When `n` is 190, the function correctly returns a dictionary with only the key `'Pierre Cox'`.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the output hints agree with the code, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
