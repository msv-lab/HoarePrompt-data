Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The examples given in the assertions cover different scenarios:

1. When `n` is 170, it includes keys with values 175, 180, and 190.
2. When `n` is 180, it includes keys with values 180 and 190.
3. When `n` is 190, it includes only the key with value 190.

The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the items based on the condition `v >= n`, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Since the provided code works correctly for the given test cases and the logic seems sound, the program is correct.
