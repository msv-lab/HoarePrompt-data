Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports this conclusion by clearly stating that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The examples provided in the assertions cover different scenarios and demonstrate the function working as intended. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the items based on the condition `v >= n`, which matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the annotations.
