Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the items based on the condition `v >= n`, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases in the assertions cover different scenarios and verify the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
