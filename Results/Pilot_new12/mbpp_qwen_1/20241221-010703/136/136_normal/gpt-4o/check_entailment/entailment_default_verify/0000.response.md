Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the functionality of the code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, creating a new dictionary with the filtered key-value pairs without modifying the original dictionary. The provided assertions cover various cases, and the function performs as intended for the given inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
