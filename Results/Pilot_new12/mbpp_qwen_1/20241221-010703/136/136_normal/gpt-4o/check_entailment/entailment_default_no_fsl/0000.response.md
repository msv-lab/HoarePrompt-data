Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines the function `func_1` which takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the entries, which matches the problem description. The provided assertions cover several scenarios, including cases where the resulting dictionary contains multiple entries, a single entry, and no entries at all. Since the function behaves as described and handles all given test cases correctly, the program is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
