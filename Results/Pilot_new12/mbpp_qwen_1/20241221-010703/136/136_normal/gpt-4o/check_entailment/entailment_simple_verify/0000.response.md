Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and confirm the function's correctness. The annotated version supports this by clearly indicating the state of the program before the function call and within the function itself. No contradictions or errors are observed from the annotations or the code, hence maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
