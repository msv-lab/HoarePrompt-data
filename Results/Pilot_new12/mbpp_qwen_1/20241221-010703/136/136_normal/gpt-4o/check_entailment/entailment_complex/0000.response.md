Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. These parameters match the inputs required by the problem description.

2. **Dictionary Filtering**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the items in the input dictionary `d`. It returns a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs where the value (`v`) is greater than or equal to `n`. This exactly matches the requirement of filtering the dictionary based on the condition `v >= n`.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns a new dictionary without modifying the original one, ensuring immutability, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided verify different scenarios:
   - When `n = 170`, the function correctly returns a dictionary with keys whose values are greater than or equal to 170.
   - When `n = 180`, the function correctly returns a dictionary with keys whose values are greater than or equal to 180.
   - When `n = 190`, the function correctly returns a dictionary with only the key-value pair where the value is exactly 190.

Since the function `func_1` behaves as expected in all tested cases and does not introduce any additional side effects or errors, it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
