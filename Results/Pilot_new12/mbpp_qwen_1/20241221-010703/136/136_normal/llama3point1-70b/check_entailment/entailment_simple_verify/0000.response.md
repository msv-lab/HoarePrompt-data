Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. Since the problem description asks for a function that filters the dictionary based on this condition, and the function meets this requirement, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
