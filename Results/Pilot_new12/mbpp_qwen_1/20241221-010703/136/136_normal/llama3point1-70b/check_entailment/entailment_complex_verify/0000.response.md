Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, returning a new dictionary containing only the specified key-value pairs. There are no issues or missing functionalities noted in the annotated version that would indicate the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
