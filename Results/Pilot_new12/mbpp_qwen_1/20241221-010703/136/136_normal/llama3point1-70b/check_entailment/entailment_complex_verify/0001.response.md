Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The annotations further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary containing only the relevant key-value pairs. Since the input is assumed to be valid, there are no issues with handling invalid inputs, and the function performs as intended according to the problem description.
