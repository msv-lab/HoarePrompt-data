You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with values that can be compared to an integer, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that for each key-value pair in `d`, if the value is less than `n`, that pair will not be included in the returned dictionary. If `d` is empty or if all values in `d` are less than `n`, the returned dictionary will be empty. There are no missing functionalities as the code correctly implements the described behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
