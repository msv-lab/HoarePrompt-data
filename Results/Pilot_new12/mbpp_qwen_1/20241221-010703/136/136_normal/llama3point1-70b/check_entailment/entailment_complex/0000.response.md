Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This matches the problem description exactly. For each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d`, the function checks if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition is met, the key-value pair is included in the returned dictionary; otherwise, it is excluded. The function correctly handles cases where the dictionary is empty or where all values are less than `n`, resulting in an empty dictionary being returned. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
