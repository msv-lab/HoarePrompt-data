Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The provided code uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the input dictionary `d` such that only key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the returned dictionary. This exactly matches the problem description. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning an empty dictionary if no values meet the condition or if the input dictionary is empty. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
