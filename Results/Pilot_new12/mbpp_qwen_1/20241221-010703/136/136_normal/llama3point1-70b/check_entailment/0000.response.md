Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This implementation works for all potential cases without any issues.
