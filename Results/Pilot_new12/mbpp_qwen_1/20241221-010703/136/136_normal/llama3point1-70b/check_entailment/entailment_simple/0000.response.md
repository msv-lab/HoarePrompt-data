Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This exactly matches the requirement to filter the dictionary based on the condition that values should be greater than or equal to `n`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and does not introduce any conditions or behaviors outside of what is specified, it is correct.
