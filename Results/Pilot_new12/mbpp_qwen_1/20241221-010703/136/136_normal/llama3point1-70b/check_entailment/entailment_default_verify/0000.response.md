Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the hints indicate that if `d` is empty or all values in `d` are less than `n`, the returned dictionary will be empty, which is consistent with the implementation. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
