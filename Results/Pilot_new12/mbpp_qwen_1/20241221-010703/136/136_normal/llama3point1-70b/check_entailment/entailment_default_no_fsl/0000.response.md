Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It filters the dictionary `d` to include only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The code handles all potential cases, including scenarios where the dictionary is empty or all values are less than `n`, resulting in an empty dictionary being returned. Since the code matches the problem description for every potential case under the given assumptions, the correctness is True.
