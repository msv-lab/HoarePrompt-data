Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The logic of the dictionary comprehension matches the problem description, and the provided annotations validate that the function behaves as expected under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
