Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by filtering the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and includes the pair in the result if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This logic matches the problem description accurately, and there are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the inputs are valid (i.e., `d` is a dictionary and `n` is an integer).
