The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that for each key-value pair in `d`, if the value is less than `n`, that pair will not be included in the returned dictionary. If `d` is empty or if all values in `d` are less than `n`, the returned dictionary will be empty. There are no missing functionalities as the code correctly implements the described behavior.
