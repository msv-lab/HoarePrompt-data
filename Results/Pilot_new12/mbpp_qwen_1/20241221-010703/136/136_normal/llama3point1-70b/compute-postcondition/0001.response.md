The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary with values that can be compared to an integer, and `n`, which is an integer. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and return a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
