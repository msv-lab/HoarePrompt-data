According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_list`. For the loop to execute, `sorted_list` must have at least one element. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(sorted_list) - 1`, meaning the loop will run as long as there are elements in the list.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `value` is an integer or float.

To ensure the loop can execute, `sorted_list` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 1 element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 0**
