Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least 1 element.
   - `value` is an integer or float.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition `sorted_list[i] < value` is true.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the length of `sorted_list`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `sorted_list[i] < value` must remain true at the start of each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `sorted_list` is a list with at least 1 element.
   - `value` is an integer or float.
   - `i` is 0 (since it was incremented from 0).
   - The condition `sorted_list[i] < value` was true.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The condition `sorted_list[i] < value` must still hold true for `i = 1`.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The condition `sorted_list[i] < value` must be checked again with `i = 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least 1 element.
- `value` is an integer or float.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `sorted_list[i] < value` must be true for the next iteration to occur.

**Final State:**
State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least 1 element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 1, and `sorted_list[1] < value`**
