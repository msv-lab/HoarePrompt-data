The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is an integer or float. Based on the given cases, the function returns one of four possible values:

- Case_1: Returns 0
- Case_2: Returns the value of variable 'i'
- Case_3: Returns `i` which is `i+1` from the initial state
- Case_4: Returns the length of the list `sorted_list`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and depending on certain conditions, return either 0, the value of variable 'i', `i+1` (where `i` is determined during execution), or the length of the list `sorted_list`.
