Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, or `len(sorted_list)` if no such element exists.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is an integer or float.
2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates through each element in `sorted_list` to find the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`.
3. **Return Condition**: If the loop finds an element in `sorted_list` that meets the condition `sorted_list[i] >= value`, it returns the index `i`.
4. **Loop Completion**: If the loop completes without finding any such element, it means all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`. In this case, the function returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that `value` is greater than all elements in the list.

Thus, the final state of the loop will either be:
- `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, or
- `i` is `len(sorted_list)` if no such element exists.
