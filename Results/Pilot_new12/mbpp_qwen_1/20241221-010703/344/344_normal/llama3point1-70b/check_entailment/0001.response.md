Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If so, it returns the index, which is the correct insertion point. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be inserted at the end.

Given the problem description and the provided function, there doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential input scenario that would make this function incorrect. The function handles all potential cases as expected.
