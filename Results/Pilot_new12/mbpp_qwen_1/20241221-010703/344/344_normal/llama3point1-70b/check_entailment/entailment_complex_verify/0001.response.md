Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If so, it returns the index, which is the correct insertion point. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be inserted at the end. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points and confirm that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
