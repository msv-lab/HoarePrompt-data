Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning indices that ensure the value maintains the sorted order. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
