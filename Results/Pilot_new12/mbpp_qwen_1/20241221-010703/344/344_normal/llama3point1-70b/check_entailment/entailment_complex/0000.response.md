Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The annotated program implements a function `func_1` that correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `sorted_list`: A list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `value`: An integer or float.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list`.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`.
   - If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element.
   - If no element in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the length of the list.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The returned index `i` ensures that `sorted_list[i]` is the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function returns `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct position to insert `value` to maintain the sorted order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`.
   - When `value` is greater than all elements, the function also correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function accurately identifies the right insertion point for `value` in a sorted list, ensuring the list remains sorted after the insertion.

Since the program follows the problem description exactly, it meets all the requirements and is therefore correct.
