Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program implements a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float. The function's goal is to find the right insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **For Loop Iteration**: The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list` using a `for` loop. For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`.
   - If an element meets this condition (`sorted_list[i] >= value`), the function immediately returns the index `i`. This means the function correctly identifies the first position in the list where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Handling No Match**: If the loop completes without finding any element that is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns `len(sorted_list)`. This indicates that `value` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.

Given these points, the function correctly identifies the right insertion point for the specified value in a sorted list, following the problem description accurately. Thus, the program is correct.
