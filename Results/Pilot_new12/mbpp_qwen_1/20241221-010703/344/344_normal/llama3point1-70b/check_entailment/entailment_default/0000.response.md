Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, the function checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If such an element is found, the function returns the index of that element, which is the right insertion point. If no such element is found, the function returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be inserted at the end of the list. This behavior matches the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case given the assumptions about valid input.
