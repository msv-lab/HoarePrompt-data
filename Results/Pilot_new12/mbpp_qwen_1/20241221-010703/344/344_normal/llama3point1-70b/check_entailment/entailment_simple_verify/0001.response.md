Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and finds the first position where the value could be inserted without violating the sorted order. If no such position is found (i.e., the value is greater than all elements in the list), it returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be inserted at the end. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
