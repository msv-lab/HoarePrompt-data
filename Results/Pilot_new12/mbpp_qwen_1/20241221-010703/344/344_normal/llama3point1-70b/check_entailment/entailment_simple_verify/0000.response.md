Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the list and returns the appropriate index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it correctly returns the length of the list, indicating the position to insert the value. The annotations align with the function's behavior and the problem description, supporting the original assessment of correctness.
