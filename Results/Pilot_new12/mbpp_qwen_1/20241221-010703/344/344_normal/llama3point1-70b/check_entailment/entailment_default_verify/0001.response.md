Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list, checking each element against the specified value, and returns the appropriate index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The function handles all potential cases as expected, including when the specified value is less than all elements in the list, greater than all elements, or falls between elements in the list. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
