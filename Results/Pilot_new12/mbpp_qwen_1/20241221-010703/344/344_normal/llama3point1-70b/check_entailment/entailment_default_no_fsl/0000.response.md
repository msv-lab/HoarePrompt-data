Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list. This matches the problem description, which requires finding the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The code handles all potential cases as described, including when the value is less than all elements in the list, equal to an element, or greater than all elements.
