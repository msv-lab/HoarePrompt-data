The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, an integer or float. The function iterates through `sorted_list` to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`. If such an element is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns the length of the list. Depending on the position of `value` within `sorted_list`, the function can return 0, the index `i`, `i+1` (where `i` is determined during execution), or the length of the list. This behavior ensures that the function correctly identifies the insertion point for `value` in a sorted list.
