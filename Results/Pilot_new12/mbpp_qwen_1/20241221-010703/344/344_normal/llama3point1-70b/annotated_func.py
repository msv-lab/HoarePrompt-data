#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, or `len(sorted_list)` if no such element exists.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #`The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, an integer or float. The function iterates through `sorted_list` to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`. If such an element is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns the length of the list. Depending on the position of `value` within `sorted_list`, the function can return 0, the index `i`, `i+1` (where `i` is determined during execution), or the length of the list. This behavior ensures that the function correctly identifies the insertion point for `value` in a sorted list.
