The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. The function uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the correct insertion point. This method ensures that the list remains sorted after the insertion. The function handles all cases correctly, including when the `value` is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. No additional functionality or edge cases are missing from the provided code.
