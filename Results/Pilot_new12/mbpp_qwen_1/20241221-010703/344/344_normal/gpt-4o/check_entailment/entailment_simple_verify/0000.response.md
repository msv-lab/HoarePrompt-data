Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clarifies that `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is an integer or float. The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is specifically designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description. Since the annotations support the correctness and the examples provided match the expected behavior, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
