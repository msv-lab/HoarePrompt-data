Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios, including values that are less than the first element, greater than the last element, and equal to existing elements in the list. The function handles all cases correctly, maintaining the sorted order of the list after insertion. Therefore, there is no evidence from the annotated version that suggests the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
