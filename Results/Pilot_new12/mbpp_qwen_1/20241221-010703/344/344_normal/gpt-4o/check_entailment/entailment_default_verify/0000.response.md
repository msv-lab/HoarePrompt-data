Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function handles all cases correctly, including when the value is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. The provided test cases also match the expected behavior, and no additional edge cases are required. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
