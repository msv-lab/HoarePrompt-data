Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. The annotations also correctly describe the state of the program and the intended operation of the function. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
