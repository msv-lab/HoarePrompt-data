Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This function returns the insertion point for the specified value in the sorted list to maintain sorted order. The examples given match the expected behavior:

- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct position to insert `6` to keep the list sorted.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct position to insert `3` to keep the list sorted.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is the correct position to insert `7` to keep the list sorted.

Since the function behaves correctly for the provided examples and the `bisect_right` function is designed to handle these cases, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
