Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotations provide a clear description of the state of the program and the behavior of the function. The examples provided in the assertions cover various scenarios, including cases where the value is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the annotations confirm the expected behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
