Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The task is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.
   - This means finding the index in the list where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `sorted_list` (which is expected to be a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order) and `value` (an integer or float).
   - It returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` should be inserted to keep the list sorted.
   - The function achieves this by using `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4`: The value `6` should be inserted at index `4` to keep the list `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]` sorted.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2`: The value `3` should be inserted at index `2` to keep the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` sorted.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4`: The value `7` should be inserted at index `4` to keep the list `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7]` sorted.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and performs the required operation correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
