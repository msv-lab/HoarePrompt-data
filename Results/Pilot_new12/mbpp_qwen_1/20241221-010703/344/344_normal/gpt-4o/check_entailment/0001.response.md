Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The examples provided cover different scenarios:

1. When the value (`6`) is greater than all elements in the list, it correctly returns the length of the list (`4`).
2. When the value (`3`) is less than the last element but greater than some elements, it correctly returns the index after the largest element that is less than `3` (`2`).
3. When the value (`7`) is greater than all elements in the list, it correctly returns the length of the list (`4`).

Since the `bisect_right` function works as expected for these cases, and the implementation matches the problem description for finding the right insertion point, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or inputs provided that would make the program incorrect based on the given problem description.
