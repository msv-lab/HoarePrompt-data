Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. This is achieved by using the `bisect.bisect_right` method, which finds the insertion point for the specified value in the sorted list. 

- The problem description requires locating the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
- The annotated comments correctly describe the purpose and behavior of the function.
- The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures that the returned index is the position where the value can be inserted without disrupting the sorted order.
- The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different values (both within the range of the list and outside it).

Given these points, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential valid cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
