Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases correctly, including when the value is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. The provided assertions also validate the function's behavior in different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
