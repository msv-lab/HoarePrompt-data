Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all given cases, including when the value is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. Since the provided examples and hints indicate that the function works correctly for all potential cases, the program is correct.
