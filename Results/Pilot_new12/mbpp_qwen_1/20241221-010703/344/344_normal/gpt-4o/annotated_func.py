#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #`The program returns the index in the sorted_list where 'value' should be inserted to keep the list sorted, which is calculated using bisect.bisect_right`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. The function uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the correct insertion point. This method ensures that the list remains sorted after the insertion. The function handles all cases correctly, including when the `value` is less than the first element, greater than the last element, or equal to an existing element in the list. No additional functionality or edge cases are missing from the provided code.
