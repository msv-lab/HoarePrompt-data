The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is an integer or float. The function returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` should be inserted to keep the list sorted, which is calculated using `bisect.bisect_right`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the index where `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.**
