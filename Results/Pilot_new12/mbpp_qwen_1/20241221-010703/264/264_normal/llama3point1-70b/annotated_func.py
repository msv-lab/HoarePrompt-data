#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a floating-point or integer number representing degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns deg multiplied by math.pi divided by 180
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`, which is a floating-point or integer number representing degrees, and returns the equivalent value in radians. The function achieves this by multiplying the input `deg` by Ï€ (pi) and then dividing the result by 180. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. After the function executes, the input degree value `deg` is transformed into its radian equivalent and returned to the caller.
