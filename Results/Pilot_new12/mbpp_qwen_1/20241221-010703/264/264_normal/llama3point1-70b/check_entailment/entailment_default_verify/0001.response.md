Final: **True**

Reasoning: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function accepts a floating-point or integer number representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. Since there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, and the implementation matches the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
