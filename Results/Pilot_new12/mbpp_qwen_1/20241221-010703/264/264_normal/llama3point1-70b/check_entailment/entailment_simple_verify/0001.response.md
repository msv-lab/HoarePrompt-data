Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version clearly shows that the function takes a degree value (which can be a floating-point or integer number) and returns the corresponding radian value by applying the correct formula. There are no issues or potential errors mentioned in the annotations that would make the program incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** stands valid.
