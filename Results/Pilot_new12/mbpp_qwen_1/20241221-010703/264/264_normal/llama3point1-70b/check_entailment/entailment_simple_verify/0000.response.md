Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a single argument `deg`, which represents degrees. The function correctly converts this degree value to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The original assessment correctly notes that the program implements this formula accurately using the `math` module. Since the problem description requires a function to convert degrees to radians and the provided code meets this requirement without any issues indicated by the annotations, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
