Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input `deg` by Ï€ (pi) and then dividing the result by 180, which is the standard formula for converting degrees to radians. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` transforms the input degree value `deg` into its radian equivalent, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Since the code handles all potential cases within the scope of the problem description, the program is correct.
