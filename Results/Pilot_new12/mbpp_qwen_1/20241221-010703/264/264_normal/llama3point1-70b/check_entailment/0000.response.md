Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The implementation uses the `math` module to access the value of \(\pi\) and performs the conversion accurately. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
