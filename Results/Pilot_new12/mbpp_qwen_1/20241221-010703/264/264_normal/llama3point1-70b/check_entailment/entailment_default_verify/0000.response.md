Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the function to convert degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function handles a floating-point or integer input and returns the corresponding radian value. There are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
