Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a floating-point or integer number representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations align with the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
