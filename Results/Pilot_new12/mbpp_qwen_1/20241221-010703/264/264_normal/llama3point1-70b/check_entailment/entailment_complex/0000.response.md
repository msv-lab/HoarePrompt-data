Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians. This is achieved by multiplying the input `deg` by `math.pi` and then dividing the result by 180, which is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians. 

The provided function does not contain any edge cases or functionalities that go beyond what is required by the problem description. It simply converts the input degrees to radians using the correct mathematical formula, and thus, the program is correct according to the given problem statement.
