Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `deg`, which can be a floating-point or integer number representing degrees. The function then returns the value of `deg` converted to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is correct and aligns with the standard mathematical definition for converting degrees to radians. Therefore, the program always performs the required conversion accurately, meeting the problem description in all cases.
