Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a degree value (`deg`) and correctly converts it to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotations indicate that the function handles valid inputs appropriately, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned that would render the program incorrect based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
