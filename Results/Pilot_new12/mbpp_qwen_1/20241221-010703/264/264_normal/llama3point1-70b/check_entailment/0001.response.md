Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate and the implementation follows the problem description for converting degrees to radians. There is no potential case identified where this function would not work as expected based on the given problem description.
