The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. The function converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying the input by `math.pi` and then dividing by 180. The function returns the resulting value in radians. The function handles the conversion accurately and returns the correct value regardless of whether the input is a float or an integer. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function will correctly handle both positive and negative degree values, as well as zero.
