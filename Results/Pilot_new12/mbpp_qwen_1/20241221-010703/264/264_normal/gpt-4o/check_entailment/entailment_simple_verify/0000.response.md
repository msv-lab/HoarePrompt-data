Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function takes a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer, and returns the corresponding value in radians. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
