Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function handles both float and integer inputs appropriately and returns the correct values for the given test cases. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would cause the function to fail, and the provided assertions validate the function's correctness. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
