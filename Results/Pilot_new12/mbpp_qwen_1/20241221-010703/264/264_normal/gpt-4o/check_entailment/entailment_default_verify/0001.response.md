Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function handles both float and integer inputs accurately and supports positive, negative, and zero degree values. The test cases given in the problem description also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
