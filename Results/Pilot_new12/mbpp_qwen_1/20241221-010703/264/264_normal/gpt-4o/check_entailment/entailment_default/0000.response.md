Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by `math.pi / 180`. The function handles both integer and float inputs as specified in the problem description. The given assertions for specific degree values (90, 60, 120) return the correct radian values, and the function works for both positive and negative degrees as well as zero. Since the function accurately performs the conversion for all tested cases and there are no explicit edge cases mentioned that would fail, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
