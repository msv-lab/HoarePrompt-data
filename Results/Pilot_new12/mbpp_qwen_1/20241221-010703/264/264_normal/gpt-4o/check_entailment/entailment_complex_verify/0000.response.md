Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function handles both integer and float inputs for degrees and returns the correct radian values as verified by the provided assertions. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail, given that the input is assumed to be valid. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment should be maintained as **True**.
