Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function correctly implements this formula and passes the provided test cases for converting 90, 60, and 120 degrees to radians. Given the output hints and the problem description, the function appears to handle both float and integer inputs accurately. Additionally, the hints indicate that the function correctly handles positive, negative, and zero degree values, which are all covered by the test cases provided. Therefore, the code seems to meet the requirements for every potential case described.
