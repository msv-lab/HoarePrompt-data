Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The given test cases assert that the function returns the correct values for 90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees. Since the function follows the conversion formula and the provided test cases demonstrate its correctness, we can conclude that the program is correct for the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the information provided.
