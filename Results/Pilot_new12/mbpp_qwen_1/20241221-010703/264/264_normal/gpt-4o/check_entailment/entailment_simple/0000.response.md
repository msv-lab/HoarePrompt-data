Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided assertions check that the function works for 90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees, and the results match the expected values. Since the program consistently applies the correct conversion formula for these cases, it meets the requirement of converting degrees to radians.
