Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `degrees`, which can be either a float or an integer, representing an angle in degrees. The function converts this angle to radians by multiplying the input by `math.pi` and then dividing by 180. The annotations clearly state that the function handles the conversion accurately and returns the correct value for both float and integer inputs. The examples provided in the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases beyond handling valid inputs, and the program successfully converts the degrees to radians for the provided examples, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
