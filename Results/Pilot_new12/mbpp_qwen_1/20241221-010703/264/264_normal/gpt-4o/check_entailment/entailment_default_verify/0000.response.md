Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided assertions with specific degree values (90, 60, and 120) are standard angles whose conversions to radians are known and tested. The output hints confirm that the function handles both float and integer inputs accurately and supports positive, negative, and zero degree values. Given that the problem description asks to write a function to convert degrees to radians and the provided code meets this requirement with appropriate testing, the original assessment is accurate.
