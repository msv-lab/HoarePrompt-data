Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The test cases provided in the code assert that the function returns the correct values for 90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees. The annotations confirm that the function takes an integer or float as input representing degrees and returns the corresponding value in radians. Since there are no issues identified in the annotated version and the provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
