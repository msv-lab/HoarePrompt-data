Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The examples given (`90`, `60`, and `120` degrees) match the expected outputs, which are standard values for these angles in radians. Since the function follows the problem description accurately and the provided test cases work as expected, the program is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail for other inputs.
