The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state where `stack` is an empty list `[]`, `char` is a character from the `expression` such that `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, the impact of this code is to add `char` to `stack`.

Therefore, the updated state of `stack` will be `[char]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is ['char'], `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is a character from the `expression` such that `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary**
