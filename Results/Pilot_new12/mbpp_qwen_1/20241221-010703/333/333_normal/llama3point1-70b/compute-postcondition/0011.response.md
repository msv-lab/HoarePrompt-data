Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`. If `char` is a key in `brackets`, `stack` will contain the corresponding opening bracket. If `char` is a value in `brackets`, `stack` will remain unchanged. The function does not alter the state of `expression` unless `char` is an opening bracket, in which case the corresponding opening bracket is pushed onto `stack`.***
