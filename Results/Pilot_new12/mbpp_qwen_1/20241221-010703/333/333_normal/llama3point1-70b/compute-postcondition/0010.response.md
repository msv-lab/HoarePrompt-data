Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), curly braces ('{', '}'), and square brackets ('[', ']'), `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']', }, and if `char` is in `brackets.values()` (i.e., `char` is a closing bracket), the function does not change the state of `stack` or `expression`. If `char` is not a closing bracket, the state of `expression` and `stack` remains unchanged.***
