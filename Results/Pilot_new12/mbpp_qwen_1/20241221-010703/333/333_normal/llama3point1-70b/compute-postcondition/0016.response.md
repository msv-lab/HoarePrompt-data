Postcondition: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, and `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`. If the last processed character was a closing bracket, the stack remains unchanged. If the last processed character was an opening bracket, the stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket. If the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, the expression is invalid.**
