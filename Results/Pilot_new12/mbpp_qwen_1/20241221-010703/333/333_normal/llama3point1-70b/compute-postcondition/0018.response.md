According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string. The loop body is omitted, but based on the provided information, we know the following:

1. The `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.
2. The `stack` is a list that contains characters from `brackets.keys()`, where `brackets` is a dictionary mapping closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
3. If the last processed character was an opening bracket, the stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket.
4. If the last processed character was a closing bracket, the stack remains unchanged.
5. If the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, the expression is invalid.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the last character processed was an opening bracket (since the problem doesn't specify, we consider the most general case). Therefore, the stack should have been updated by pushing this opening bracket onto it.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the `expression` must be processed. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop will continue if there are more characters in the `expression` to process.
- The state of the `stack` will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless the next character is a closing bracket that needs to be matched with the top of the stack.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.
- `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()` and includes the opening bracket that was pushed in the previous iteration.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`**
