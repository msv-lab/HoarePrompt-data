Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`. If `char` is in `brackets` and the popped character from `stack` matches the corresponding closing character for `char`, the function continues without returning a specific value. If `char` is not in `brackets` or the popped character does not match, the function returns False.***
