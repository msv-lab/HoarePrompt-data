The code defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. However, this assignment does not affect the values of the existing variables `expression` or `stack`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), curly braces ('{', '}'), and square brackets ('[', ']'); `stack` is an empty list []; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
