You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: We know that the `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` is a list that contains characters which are either opening brackets (if `char` is a key in `brackets`) or remain unchanged (if `char` is a value in `brackets`).

2. **Loop Behavior**: For each character `char` in the `expression`, the loop checks if `char` is a key in `brackets`. If it is, it means `char` is an opening bracket, and the corresponding opening bracket is pushed onto the `stack`. Otherwise, `char` is a closing bracket, and the loop checks if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, the top element is popped from the stack; otherwise, the expression is invalid.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over each character in `expression`, at the end of the previous iteration, we have processed one character. Let's assume the last character processed was `char`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **Expression**: The `expression` string remains unchanged as the loop only processes its contents.
   - **Stack**: Depending on the `char`, the stack either remains unchanged (if `char` is a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if `char` is an opening bracket).

Since we don't know the exact `char` from the end of the previous iteration, let's consider both cases:

- **If `char` is a closing bracket**: The stack remains unchanged.
- **If `char` is an opening bracket**: The stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket.

Given that we need to provide a general answer without knowing the exact `char`, we can summarize the state adjustment as follows:

**General Answer**:
At the end of the previous iteration, the `expression` remains a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` either remains unchanged (if the last character processed was a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if the last character processed was an opening bracket).

**State**: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()` or may have a new character added if the last processed character was an opening bracket**.

To be more precise, the state would look like this:

- **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets**.
- **`stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the updated stack based on the last processed character.
```
stack.append(char)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
