The code initializes an empty list named `stack`. This operation does not affect the value of the `expression` variable, which remains as a string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), curly braces ('{', '}'), and square brackets ('[', ']'); `stack` is an empty list []**
