Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: We know that the `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` is a list that contains characters which are either opening brackets (if `char` is a key in `brackets`) or remain unchanged (if `char` is a value in `brackets`).

2. **Loop Behavior**: For each character `char` in the `expression`, the loop checks if `char` is a key in `brackets`. If it is, it means `char` is an opening bracket, and the corresponding opening bracket is pushed onto the `stack`. Otherwise, `char` is a closing bracket, and the loop checks if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, the top element is popped from the stack; otherwise, the expression is invalid.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over each character in `expression`, at the end of the previous iteration, we have processed one character. Let's assume the last character processed was `char`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **Expression**: The `expression` string remains unchanged as the loop only processes its contents.
   - **Stack**: Depending on the `char`, the stack either remains unchanged (if `char` is a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if `char` is an opening bracket).

Since we don't know the exact `char` from the end of the previous iteration, let's consider both cases:

- **If `char` is a closing bracket**: The stack remains unchanged.
- **If `char` is an opening bracket**: The stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket.

Given that we need to provide a general answer without knowing the exact `char`, we can summarize the state adjustment as follows:

**General Answer**:
At the end of the previous iteration, the `expression` remains a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` either remains unchanged (if the last character processed was a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if the last character processed was an opening bracket).

**State**: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()` or may have a new character added if the last processed character was an opening bracket**.

To be more precise, the state would look like this:

- **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets**.
- **`stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the updated stack based on the last processed character.
