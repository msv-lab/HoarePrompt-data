Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is an empty list if and only if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, otherwise `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string.
- If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists in `brackets`), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
- If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it exists in `brackets.values()`), the loop checks whether the `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`, indicating the expression is invalid.
- If the conditions are met, the top element of the `stack` is popped.

After the loop completes:
- If all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, the `stack` will be empty because all elements have been successfully matched and popped.
- If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the `stack`, the `stack` will contain those unmatched opening brackets, indicating that the expression is invalid.

Thus, the final state of the variables `expression` and `stack` depends on whether the expression is valid or not.
