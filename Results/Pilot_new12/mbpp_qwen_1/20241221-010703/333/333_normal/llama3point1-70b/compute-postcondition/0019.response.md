The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Since the initial state of `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`, and no specific value of `char` is given, we assume `char` is one of these characters.

The output state will include the updated list `stack` with the new character appended to it, while maintaining the initial values of other variables that are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list containing its initial elements plus the character `char`.**
