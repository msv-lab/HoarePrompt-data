You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: We know that the `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` is a list that contains characters which are either opening brackets (if `char` is a key in `brackets`) or remain unchanged (if `char` is a value in `brackets`).

2. **Loop Behavior**: For each character `char` in the `expression`, the loop checks if `char` is a key in `brackets`. If it is, it means `char` is an opening bracket, and the corresponding opening bracket is pushed onto the `stack`. Otherwise, `char` is a closing bracket, and the loop checks if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, the top element is popped from the stack; otherwise, the expression is invalid.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over each character in `expression`, at the end of the previous iteration, we have processed one character. Let's assume the last character processed was `char`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **Expression**: The `expression` string remains unchanged as the loop only processes its contents.
   - **Stack**: Depending on the `char`, the stack either remains unchanged (if `char` is a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if `char` is an opening bracket).

Since we don't know the exact `char` from the end of the previous iteration, let's consider both cases:

- **If `char` is a closing bracket**: The stack remains unchanged.
- **If `char` is an opening bracket**: The stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket.

Given that we need to provide a general answer without knowing the exact `char`, we can summarize the state adjustment as follows:

**General Answer**:
At the end of the previous iteration, the `expression` remains a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The `stack` either remains unchanged (if the last character processed was a closing bracket) or gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket (if the last character processed was an opening bracket).

**State**: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()` or may have a new character added if the last processed character was an opening bracket**.

To be more precise, the state would look like this:

- **`expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets**.
- **`stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing with the updated stack based on the last processed character.
Program Fragment:
```
if char in brackets:
else:

```
if part: `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets; `stack` is a list which contains characters from `brackets.keys()` and has a new character added if the last processed character was an opening bracket
else part: `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, and `stack` is a list which may contain characters from `brackets.keys()`. If the last processed character was a closing bracket, the stack remains unchanged. If the last processed character was an opening bracket, the stack gets updated by pushing the corresponding opening bracket. If the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, the expression is invalid.

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
