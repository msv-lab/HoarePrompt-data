The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), curly braces (`{`, `}`), and square brackets (`[`, `]`). It uses a stack to track opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are matched correctly, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty, indicating unmatched opening brackets, the function returns `False`. The function handles the following cases:
- Returns `False` if the stack is not empty at the end of the iteration, indicating unmatched opening brackets.
- Returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating all brackets are matched correctly.
Potential edge cases include:
- An empty string `expression` will result in an empty stack, and thus the function will return `True`.
- A string with mismatched or unbalanced brackets will leave unmatched opening brackets in the stack, causing the function to return `False`.
