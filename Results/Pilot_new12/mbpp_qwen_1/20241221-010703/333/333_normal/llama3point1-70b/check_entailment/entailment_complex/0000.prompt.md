You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), curly braces ('{', '}'), and square brackets ('[', ']').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is an empty list if and only if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, otherwise `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the `stack` is empty (meaning all brackets are matched correctly), or False if the `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), curly braces (`{`, `}`), and square brackets (`[`, `]`). It uses a stack to track opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are matched correctly, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty, indicating unmatched opening brackets, the function returns `False`. The function handles the following cases:
- Returns `False` if the stack is not empty at the end of the iteration, indicating unmatched opening brackets.
- Returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating all brackets are matched correctly.
Potential edge cases include:
- An empty string `expression` will result in an empty stack, and thus the function will return `True`.
- A string with mismatched or unbalanced brackets will leave unmatched opening brackets in the stack, causing the function to return `False`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
