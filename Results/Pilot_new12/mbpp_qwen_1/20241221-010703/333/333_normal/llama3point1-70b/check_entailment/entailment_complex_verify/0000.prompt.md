You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. It handles all types of brackets (parentheses `()`, braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`) as specified in the problem description. The function ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. By the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were properly closed, indicating a balanced expression. There are no edge cases or inputs that this function would handle incorrectly based on the provided logic.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), curly braces ('{', '}'), and square brackets ('[', ']').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a non-empty string containing only parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, `stack` is an empty list if and only if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, otherwise `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the `stack` is empty (meaning all brackets are matched correctly), or False if the `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), curly braces (`{`, `}`), and square brackets (`[`, `]`). It uses a stack to track opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are matched correctly, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty, indicating unmatched opening brackets, the function returns `False`. The function handles the following cases:
- Returns `False` if the stack is not empty at the end of the iteration, indicating unmatched opening brackets.
- Returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating all brackets are matched correctly.
Potential edge cases include:
- An empty string `expression` will result in an empty stack, and thus the function will return `True`.
- A string with mismatched or unbalanced brackets will leave unmatched opening brackets in the stack, causing the function to return `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
