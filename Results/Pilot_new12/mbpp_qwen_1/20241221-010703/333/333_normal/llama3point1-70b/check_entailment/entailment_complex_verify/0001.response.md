Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function uses a stack to track opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last opening bracket seen. The function returns `False` immediately if a closing bracket does not match the expected opening bracket, and it ensures the stack is empty at the end of the expression, which indicates that all brackets are properly closed and matched. The annotations also confirm that the function handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as an empty string and strings with mismatched or unbalanced brackets. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
