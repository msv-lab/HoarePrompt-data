Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if an expression is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The code handles the following cases:

- It appends opening brackets to the stack.
- It checks if the current character is a closing bracket and whether it matches the top of the stack. If not, it returns `False`.
- If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are matched correctly, and the function returns `True`.

The potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints are also handled correctly by the code:
- An empty string results in an empty stack, and the function returns `True`.
- A string with mismatched or unbalanced brackets leaves unmatched opening brackets in the stack, causing the function to return `False`.

Since the code correctly implements the logic for checking if the expression is balanced for every potential case described, the program is correct.
