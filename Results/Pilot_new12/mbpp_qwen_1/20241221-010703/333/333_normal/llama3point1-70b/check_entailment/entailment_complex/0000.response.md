Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a string `expression` that consists solely of parentheses `(`, `)`, curly braces `{`, `}`, and square brackets `[`, `]`. The problem description states that the input should contain only these characters, and the function adheres to this requirement.

2. **Stack Usage**: The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. For each character in the input string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), it checks whether the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack matches the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If not, it immediately returns `False`.

3. **Final Stack Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets were properly closed in the correct order, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that there were unmatched opening brackets.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - An empty string results in an empty stack, leading to a return value of `True`.
   - Mismatched or unbalanced brackets leave unmatched opening brackets in the stack, resulting in a return value of `False`.

Given the detailed explanation above, the function `func_1` consistently follows the problem description, ensuring that the input string is checked for balanced brackets and returning the correct boolean value based on the balance of the input string. Therefore, the program is correct.
