Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function returns `True` if the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, indicating all brackets are matched correctly, and `False` otherwise. The code handles the specified edge cases, such as an empty string and mismatched or unbalanced brackets. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
