Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The provided code handles all types of brackets as specified in the problem description. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets are matched correctly) and `False` otherwise (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets). Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
