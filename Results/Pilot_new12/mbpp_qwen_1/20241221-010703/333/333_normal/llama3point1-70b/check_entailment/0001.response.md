Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last opening bracket seen. The function returns `False` immediately if a closing bracket does not match the expected opening bracket, and it ensures the stack is empty at the end of the expression, which indicates that all brackets are properly closed and matched. Given the structure of the function, it handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description.
