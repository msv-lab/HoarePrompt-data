Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. It handles all types of brackets (parentheses `()`, braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`) as specified in the problem description. The function ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. By the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were properly closed, indicating a balanced expression. There are no edge cases or inputs that this function would handle incorrectly based on the provided logic.
