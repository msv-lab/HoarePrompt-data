Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to check if the given expression is balanced. The annotated version provides clear insights into the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets. 

- Before the function call, the input `expression` is guaranteed to be a string containing only the specified types of brackets, as stated in the problem description and the annotations.
- During the execution of the for loop, the function correctly pushes opening brackets onto the stack and pops them off when encountering matching closing brackets. If at any point the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if the popped opening bracket does not match the current closing bracket, the function returns `False`.
- After the for loop, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, all brackets were matched correctly, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`, indicating unmatched opening brackets.

Given that the annotations align with the problem description and the function logic, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
