Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for checking if a given expression is balanced. It uses a stack to match opening and closing symbols and handles various cases, including nested and consecutive pairs. The examples given in the problem description (`'{()}[{}]'`, `'{{()[]}}'`, and `'{{}[]}{()}[][]({})'`) are correctly handled, returning `True`. The hint also confirms that the function covers all necessary edge cases, including scenarios with unmatched opening symbols, mismatched pairs, or incomplete pairs. Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
