Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and ensures that each closing symbol matches the most recent unmatched opening symbol. The function handles all potential cases where the expression can be valid or invalid, including scenarios with unmatched opening symbols, mismatched pairs, and incomplete pairs. The provided assertions also cover various scenarios, ensuring that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
