Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced. The function uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets and handles all the provided test cases correctly. The output hints further confirm that the function properly evaluates expressions with nested and mixed types of brackets, ensuring that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and that the pairs are properly nested. Since the function meets the requirements and the original assessment accurately reflects its functionality, the original assessment is correct.
