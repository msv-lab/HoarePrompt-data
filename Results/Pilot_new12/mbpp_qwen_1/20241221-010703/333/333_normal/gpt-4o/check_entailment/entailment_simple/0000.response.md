Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced or not. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty stack and a dictionary to map closing characters to their corresponding opening characters.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through each character in the input string `expr`.
   - If the character is an opening symbol (i.e., one of `{`, `[`, or `(`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing symbol (i.e., one of `}`, `]`, or `)`), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack does not match the expected opening symbol. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it pops the top element from the stack.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation:
- `'{()}[{}]'` is balanced, so the function should return `True`.
- `'{()}[{]'` is not balanced because the square bracket is not properly closed, so the function should return `False`.
- `'{()}[{}][]({})'` is balanced, so the function should return `True`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to check for balanced expressions and passes the given test cases, it satisfies the problem description.
