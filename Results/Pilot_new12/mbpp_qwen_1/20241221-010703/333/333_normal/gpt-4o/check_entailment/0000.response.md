Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the last unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all the provided test cases correctly:

- `'{()}[{}]'` is balanced, so it returns `True`.
- `'{()}[{]'` is not balanced because the second set of brackets `[{}]` is invalid, so it returns `False`.
- `'{()}[{}][]({})'` is balanced, so it returns `True`.

The function also handles various combinations of brackets and nested structures correctly. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
