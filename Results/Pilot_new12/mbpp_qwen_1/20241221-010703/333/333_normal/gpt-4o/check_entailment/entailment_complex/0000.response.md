Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to check if a given expression is balanced. The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`), and it checks whether these symbols are properly paired and nested.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Use of Stack**: The program uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols. This is a standard approach for checking balanced expressions.
2. **Matching Pairs**: It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` to map each closing symbol to its corresponding opening symbol. This ensures that whenever a closing symbol is encountered, the program can check if the top of the stack matches the expected opening symbol.
3. **Iterating Through Expression**: The program iterates through each character in the expression, pushing opening symbols onto the stack and popping them off when a matching closing symbol is found.
4. **Edge Cases Handling**: After processing the entire expression, the program checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening symbols were matched and popped off, indicating a balanced expression. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched opening symbols, indicating an unbalanced expression.
5. **Assertions Verification**: The provided assertions cover various cases, including balanced and unbalanced expressions, and the function passes all these tests, validating its correctness.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all relevant edge cases, it is correct.
