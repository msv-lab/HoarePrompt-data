Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression is balanced. The annotations describe the state of the program at different points and confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function uses a stack to match opening and closing symbols and returns `True` if the stack is empty after processing the entire expression, indicating that all symbols were properly matched. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
