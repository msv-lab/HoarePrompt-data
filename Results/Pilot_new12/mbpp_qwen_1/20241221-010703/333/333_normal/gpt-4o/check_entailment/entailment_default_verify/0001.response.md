Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as nested and sequential expressions, as indicated by the test cases. The output hints further confirm that the function checks for balanced expressions by ensuring all opening symbols are properly closed. Since the function meets the problem description and the test cases demonstrate its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
