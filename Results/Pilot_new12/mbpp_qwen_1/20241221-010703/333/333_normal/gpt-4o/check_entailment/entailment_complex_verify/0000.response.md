Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly uses a stack to validate the balance of the expression consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. The function iterates through each character of the input string, pushing opening symbols onto the stack and popping them off when a matching closing symbol is encountered. If the stack is empty when a closing symbol is encountered, or if the popped symbol does not match the expected opening symbol, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any unmatched opening symbols, it returns `True`, indicating the expression is balanced. The annotated version clearly supports this behavior and the provided test cases confirm the function works as intended for all given examples.
