Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It matches each closing bracket with the last seen opening bracket and ensures all brackets are properly closed. The function handles multiple expressions separated by `[]` correctly, as demonstrated in the test case `'{()}[{}][]({})'`. Additionally, it correctly identifies unbalanced expressions like `'{()}[{]'`.

Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound for handling various potential cases (including nested and sequential expressions), the program is correct.
