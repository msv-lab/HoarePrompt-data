The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expr`, a string consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It checks whether the expression is balanced, meaning that every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of symbols are properly nested. The function uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening symbols. After iterating through the string, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating the expression is valid), otherwise it returns `False` (indicating the expression is invalid). The function covers all possible edge cases where the expression can be valid or invalid, including scenarios where there are unmatched opening symbols, mismatched pairs, or incomplete pairs.
