Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters.
   - `stack` is a list.
   - `char` is the second character in `expr`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `expr`.
   - The loop starts with `char` being the second character.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop**:
   - If `char` is a closing bracket, it checks if the top element of the `stack` matches its corresponding opening bracket.
   - If they don't match, the function returns `False` immediately.
   - If they do match, the top element of the `stack` is popped (or the stack remains unchanged if it was empty).

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state after processing the previous character in the loop.

5. **Determine the Next Character**:
   - Since `char` was the second character in the loop, the next character in `expr` would be the third character.
   - Let's call this next character `next_char`.

6. **Update Stack State**:
   - Depending on whether `next_char` is an opening or closing bracket, the stack will either be updated (pushed or popped) or remain the same.

Given these steps, let's update the states:

- `expr` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `char` changes from the second character to the third character.
- The stack may have been modified based on the previous character (`char`), but we need to consider the next character (`next_char`) to determine the new state.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
1. Identify `next_char` as the third character in `expr`.
2. Determine how the stack might have changed based on the previous character (`char`).
3. Ensure the stack condition remains valid for the next iteration.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `expr` is the same as before.
- `char` is now the third character in `expr`.
- The stack might be empty or contain some elements depending on the previous character.

Therefore, the state after the previous iteration is:

**State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters, `stack` is a list that may have been modified, and `char` is the third character in `expr`**.
