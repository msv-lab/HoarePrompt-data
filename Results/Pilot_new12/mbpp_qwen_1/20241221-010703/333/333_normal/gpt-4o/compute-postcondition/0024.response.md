Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list that is either empty (if the expression is valid) or contains the unmatched opening symbols in reverse order (if the expression is invalid), and `char` is the last character in `expr`.**

### Explanation:
- **`expr`**: The input string remains the same throughout the loop.
- **`stack`**: 
  - If the `expr` is a valid sequence of balanced parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, the `stack` will be empty at the end of the loop.
  - If the `expr` is an invalid sequence, the `stack` will contain the unmatched opening symbols in reverse order (e.g., if the expression is "([)]", the stack might contain `[` and `{`).
- **`char`**: The `char` variable will hold the last character in the `expr` string after the loop has completed.

This output state encompasses both the cases where the loop executes (and the string is checked for balance) and the case where the loop does not execute (which implies the string is empty).
