`char` is the second character in `expr`, and `stack` is a list. The code appends `char` to `stack`. Therefore, the updated value of `stack` is `[char]`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters, `stack` is `[char]`, and `char` is the second character in `expr`.**
