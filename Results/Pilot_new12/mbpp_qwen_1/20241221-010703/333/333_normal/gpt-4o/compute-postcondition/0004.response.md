`stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in `expr`, and `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the list `stack`. Therefore, the updated state is that `stack` now contains the value of `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list containing the first character in `expr`, `char` is the first character in `expr`.**
