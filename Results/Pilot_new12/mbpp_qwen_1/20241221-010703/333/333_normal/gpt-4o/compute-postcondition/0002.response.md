State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in `expr`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over each character (`char`) in the string `expr`.
2. **Initial Condition**: At the start of the loop, `expr` is a string containing valid characters (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces), and `stack` is an empty list.
3. **First Iteration**: For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one character in `expr`. After the first iteration, `char` will be the first character in `expr`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to specify that `expr` is non-empty and `char` is the first character in `expr`.
