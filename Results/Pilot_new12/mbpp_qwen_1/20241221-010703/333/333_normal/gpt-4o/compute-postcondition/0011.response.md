Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list, and `char` is the first character in `expr`. If `char` is in the set of values defined in `matching_pairs`, the stack either becomes non-empty with the corresponding opening symbol or remains unchanged with the top element being the matching pair; otherwise, the stack remains unchanged.***
