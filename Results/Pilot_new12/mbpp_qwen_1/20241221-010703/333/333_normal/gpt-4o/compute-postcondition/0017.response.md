Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters, `stack` is a list, and `char` is the second character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket and the top element of the stack does not match its opening counterpart, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything, implying that the stack has been modified appropriately.***
