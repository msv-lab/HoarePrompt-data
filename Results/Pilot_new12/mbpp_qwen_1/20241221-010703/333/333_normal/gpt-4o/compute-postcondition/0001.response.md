The given code snippet defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. However, this code does not alter any variable values or perform any operations that would change the state of the program. The initial state of `expr` (a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) and `stack` (an empty list) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces; `stack` is an empty list**
