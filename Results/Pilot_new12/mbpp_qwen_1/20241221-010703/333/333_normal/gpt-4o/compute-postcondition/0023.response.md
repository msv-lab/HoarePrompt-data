Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters, `stack` is a list that may have been modified, and `char` is the third character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket and either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, `char` is appended to the stack.***
