Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least two characters, `stack` is a list, and `char` is the second character in `expr`. If the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the matching pair of `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything, implying that the stack has been modified appropriately.***
