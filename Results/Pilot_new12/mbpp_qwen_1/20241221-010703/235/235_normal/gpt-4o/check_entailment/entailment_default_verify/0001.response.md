Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code and the output hints confirm that the function iterates through each digit of the input number `n`, adds it to a cumulative total, and then reduces `n` by removing the last digit. The function passes the provided test cases, covering a range of scenarios including a three-digit number, a two-digit number, and a two-digit number with a sum resulting in a two-digit total. Since the function logic is sound and the test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains True.
