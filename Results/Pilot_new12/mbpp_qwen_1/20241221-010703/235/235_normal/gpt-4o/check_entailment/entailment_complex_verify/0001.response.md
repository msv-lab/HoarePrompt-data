Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations provided support this correctness by describing the state of the program at different points, indicating that the function iterates through each digit of the input number, adds it to a cumulative total, and reduces the number until it reaches 0. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct remains valid.
