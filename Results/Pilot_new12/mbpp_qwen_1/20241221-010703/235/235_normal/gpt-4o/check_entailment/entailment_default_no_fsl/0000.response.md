Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The code iterates through each digit of the input number `n` using a while loop, adds each digit to the `total` variable, and then reduces `n` by removing the last digit (`n //= 10`). The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases (345, 12, and 97). Since the code handles all digits correctly and the provided examples match the problem description, the function is correct for every potential case.
