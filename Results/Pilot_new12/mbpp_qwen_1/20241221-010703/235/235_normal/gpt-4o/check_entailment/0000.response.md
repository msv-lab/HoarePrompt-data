Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to the `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` until `n` becomes 0. This process ensures that the sum of all digits is calculated correctly. Given the test cases provided also confirm its correctness for those specific inputs, we can conclude that the function works as expected for the described problem. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the logic that would cause the function to fail for other valid inputs.
