Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code and the output hints confirm this functionality. The function iterates through each digit of the input number, adds it to a cumulative total, and continues until all digits have been processed. The test cases given (assertions) validate the function's correctness for the provided inputs. Since the problem description aligns with the functionality demonstrated by the code and the output hints, and there are no indications of incorrect behavior or unhandled edge cases, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
