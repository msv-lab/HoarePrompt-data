Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why:

1. **Function Input**: The function accepts a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of the digits.
   - A `while` loop is used to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and add it to `total`.
   - The last digit is removed from `n` using integer division `n //= 10`.
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

3. **Loop Termination and Return**:
   - Once the loop terminates, `n` is guaranteed to be 0, and `total` contains the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.
   - The function returns `total`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(345)` correctly returns `12` because \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\).
   - `func_1(12)` correctly returns `3` because \(1 + 2 = 3\).
   - `func_1(97)` correctly returns `16` because \(9 + 7 = 16\).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the specified functionality without any deviations or missing cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `True`.
