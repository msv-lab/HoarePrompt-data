Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations support this by clearly stating that the function iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to the `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` until `n` becomes 0. The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
