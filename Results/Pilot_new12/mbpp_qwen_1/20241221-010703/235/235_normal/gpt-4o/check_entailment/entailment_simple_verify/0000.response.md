Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations indicate that the function iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to the `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` until `n` becomes 0. This process ensures that the sum of all digits is calculated correctly. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
