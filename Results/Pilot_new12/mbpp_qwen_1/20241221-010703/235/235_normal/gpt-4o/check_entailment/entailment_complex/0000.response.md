Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of its digits. The function uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number, adding them to a cumulative total (`total`). After the loop completes, the function returns the total sum of the digits.

The program correctly handles the following cases based on the provided assertions:
- When `n = 345`, the sum of the digits is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
- When `n = 12`, the sum of the digits is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- When `n = 97`, the sum of the digits is `9 + 7 = 16`.

Since the program processes each digit of the input number and returns the sum, it correctly implements the described functionality for any non-negative integer input. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
