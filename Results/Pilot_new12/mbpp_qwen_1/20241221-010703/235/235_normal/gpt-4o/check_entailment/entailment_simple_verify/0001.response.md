Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each digit of the input number `n`, adds it to the `total` variable, and then updates `n` by removing the last digit. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (a three-digit number, a two-digit number, and a two-digit number with a sum resulting in a two-digit total) and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the function meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
