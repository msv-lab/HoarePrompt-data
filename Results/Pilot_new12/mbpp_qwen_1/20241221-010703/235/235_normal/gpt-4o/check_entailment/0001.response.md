Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function iterates through each digit of the input number `n`, adding it to the `total` variable, and then updates `n` by removing the last digit. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (a three-digit number, a two-digit number, and a two-digit number with a sum resulting in a two-digit total) and the function passes all these tests. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic seems sound for any non-negative integer, we can conclude that the function is correct.
