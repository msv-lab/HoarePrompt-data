Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by iterating through each digit using a while loop and updating the total sum. The examples provided (`func_1(345) == 12`, `func_1(12) == 3`, `func_1(97) == 16`) correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. The code handles all potential cases of non-negative integers, and the output hints align with the implementation. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
