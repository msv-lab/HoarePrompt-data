Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of all its digits. The function iterates through each digit of `n`, adding them to a cumulative total. After processing all digits, `n` is reduced to 0. The final state of the program is that the function returns the total sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0, the function will immediately return 0 since there are no digits to process.
- The function correctly handles all non-negative integers, including those with multiple digits and leading zeros.
