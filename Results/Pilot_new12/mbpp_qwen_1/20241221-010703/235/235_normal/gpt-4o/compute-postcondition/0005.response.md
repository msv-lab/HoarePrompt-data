`total` is incremented by `n % 10`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, but the exact value of `n` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n % 10`. However, we know that `n % 10` will be a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value**
