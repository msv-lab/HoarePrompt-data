The code snippet `total += n % 10` means that the last digit of `n` (obtained by `n % 10`) is added to `total`. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `total` or `n`, we cannot determine their exact values. But we know that `total` is updated by adding the last digit of `n` to its current value.

Output State: **`total` is increased by the last digit of `n`, and `n` is unchanged.**
