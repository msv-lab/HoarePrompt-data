According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, meaning `n` could be 0 or any positive integer.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and `total` is 0**
