`total` is incremented by `n % 10`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n % 10` will be a non-negative digit (0 through 9). The value of `total` is initially 0, so it will be updated to the first digit of `n` after this operation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is `n % 10`; `total` is a non-negative digit**
