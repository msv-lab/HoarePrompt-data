The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, which means the last digit of `n` is removed. This affects the value of `n` but does not change the initial state of `total`. The last digit of `n` is effectively discarded.

Output State: **`total` is increased by the last digit of `n`, and `n` is `n` divided by 10 and truncated to an integer.**
