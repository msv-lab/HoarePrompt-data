`n` is divided by 10 using integer division (`//=`), which means the last digit of `n` (represented by `n % 10` in the initial state) is removed from `n`. The value of `total` remains unchanged because the operation does not affect it. Therefore, `total` is still equal to `n % 10`, which is a non-negative digit. The Output State is: `n` is now the integer obtained by removing the last digit from its original value, `total` is `n % 10`, `total` is a non-negative digit.

Output State: **`n` is the integer obtained by removing the last digit from its original value, `total` is `n % 10`, `total` is a non-negative digit**
