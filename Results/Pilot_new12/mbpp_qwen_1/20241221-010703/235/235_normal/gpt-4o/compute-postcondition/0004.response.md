Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the integer obtained by removing the last digit from its original value.
   - `total` is `n % 10`.
   - `total` is a non-negative digit.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop condition is `while n > 0`.

3. **Current State Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `n` is obtained by removing the last digit from the original value, `n` will be a positive integer as long as the original number had more than one digit.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.
   - Given that `total` is `n % 10` and `total` is a non-negative digit (i.e., `0 <= total <= 9`), this doesn't affect the value of `n` directly in terms of its positivity.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
