Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is the integer obtained by removing the rightmost digit from its original value.
   - `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while n > 0`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is the integer obtained by removing the rightmost digit from its original value, `n` must still have digits left (i.e., `n` must be greater than 0).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is now the integer obtained by removing the rightmost digit, it means that the rightmost digit of `n` has been removed in the previous iteration. Therefore, `n` must still have digits left to continue the loop.
   - The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, as this is the condition for the loop to continue.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the next iteration.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0**
