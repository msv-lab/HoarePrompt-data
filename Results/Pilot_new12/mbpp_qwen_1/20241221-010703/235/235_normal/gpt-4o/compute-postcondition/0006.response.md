The code `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. This operation removes the rightmost digit from `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value

After executing the code `n //= 10`, the rightmost digit of `n` is removed. Since `total` was updated by adding `n % 10` (the rightmost digit of `n` before the operation) to its current value, the value of `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is now the integer obtained by removing the rightmost digit from its original value, `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value**
