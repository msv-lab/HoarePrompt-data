The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of all its digits. The function iterates through each digit of `n`, adding them to a cumulative total. After processing all digits, `n` is reduced to 0. The final state of the program is that the function returns the total sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.
