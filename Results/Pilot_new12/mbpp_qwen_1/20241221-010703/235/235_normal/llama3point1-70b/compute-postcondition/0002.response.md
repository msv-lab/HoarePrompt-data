Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. No other edge cases are present in the code; the function assumes that `n` is always a non-negative integer.**
