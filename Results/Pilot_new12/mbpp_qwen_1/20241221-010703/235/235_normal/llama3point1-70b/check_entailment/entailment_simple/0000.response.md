Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the problem description by calculating the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description specifies that `n` should be a non-negative integer. The provided function assumes that `n` is valid (non-negative and an integer), as per the instruction that we assume the input will be valid.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - `str(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string.
   - The generator expression `digit for digit in str(n)` iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`.
   - `int(digit)` converts each character back to an integer.
   - `sum(...)` computes the sum of these integers.

3. **Output**: The function returns the computed sum of the digits, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Since the function performs all the necessary steps to meet the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
