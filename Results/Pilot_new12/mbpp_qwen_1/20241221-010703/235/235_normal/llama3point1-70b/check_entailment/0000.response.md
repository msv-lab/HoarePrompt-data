Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values. This approach works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and large numbers. There are no potential cases identified where this program fails to meet the problem description.
