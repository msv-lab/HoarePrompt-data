Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that the input `n` is a non-negative integer. The program correctly handles this by converting the integer `n` to a string and then iterating over each character (digit) in the string. Since the input is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer, no additional validation is needed.

2. **Sum Calculation**: For each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, the program converts it back to an integer and sums these integers. This correctly computes the sum of the digits of `n`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 0. When `n` is 0, the string representation is also "0", and the sum of its digits is 0. The program returns 0, which is the correct result.

4. **No Other Edge Cases**: The problem description specifies that there are no other edge cases. The program does not introduce any additional edge cases that are not covered by the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the described functionality without introducing any invalid behavior or unhandled edge cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
