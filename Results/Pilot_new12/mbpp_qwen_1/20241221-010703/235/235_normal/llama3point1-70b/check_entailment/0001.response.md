Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach correctly computes the sum of the digits of the given non-negative integer for all possible inputs. There are no edge cases or potential issues with this implementation that would cause it to fail for any valid input.
