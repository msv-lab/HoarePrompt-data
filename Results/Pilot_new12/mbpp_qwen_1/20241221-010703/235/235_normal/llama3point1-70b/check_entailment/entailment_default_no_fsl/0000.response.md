Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iteration over each digit, conversion of each character back to an integer, and summation. The function also correctly returns 0 for the input 0. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly under the assumption of valid input.
