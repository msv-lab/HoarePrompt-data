Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. Additionally, the function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is maintained.
