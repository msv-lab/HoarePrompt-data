Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values. It also mentions that the function returns 0 for the input 0, which is a valid edge case. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and there are no issues identified, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
