Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iteration over each character (digit), conversion of each character back to an integer, and summation of these integers. The function also correctly returns 0 when the input is 0, which is an important edge case. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and there are no identified issues with the implementation, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
