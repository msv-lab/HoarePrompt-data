Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The code handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. There are no other edge cases mentioned in the output hints, and the code does not contain any conditions that would cause it to fail for any valid non-negative integer input. Thus, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
