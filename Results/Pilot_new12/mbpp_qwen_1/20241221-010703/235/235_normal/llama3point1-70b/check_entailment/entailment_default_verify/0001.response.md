Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints confirm that the function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values. The function also correctly returns 0 when the input is 0. Since the problem description and the provided code align, and the output hints validate this functionality without any noted edge cases or issues, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
