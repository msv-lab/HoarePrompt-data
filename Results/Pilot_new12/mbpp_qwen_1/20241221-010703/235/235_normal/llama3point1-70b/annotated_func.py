#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. No other edge cases are present in the code; the function assumes that `n` is always a non-negative integer.
