Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function iterates over the string using a list comprehension and includes only characters with even indices. The provided test cases cover various string lengths and characters, and the function passes all of them. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and there are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where it would fail based on the problem description, the program is correct.
