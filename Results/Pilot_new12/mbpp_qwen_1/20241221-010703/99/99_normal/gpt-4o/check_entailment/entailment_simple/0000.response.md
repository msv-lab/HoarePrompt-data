Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the characters at even indices (0-based indexing). This is evident from the test cases provided:

- `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`
- `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`
- `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`
- `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s`, selecting characters where the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`). Then, it joins these characters into a single string using `''.join()`. This approach ensures that only characters at even indices are included in the returned string, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Since the program meets the requirement of removing characters with odd index values, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
