Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values by selecting only characters with even indices. The annotated version clearly shows that the function returns a string containing every second character from the original string, starting with the first character. This matches the problem description perfectly, and the provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
