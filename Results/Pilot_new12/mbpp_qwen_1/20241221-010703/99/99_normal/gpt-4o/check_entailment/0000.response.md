Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only characters with even indices. This logic correctly matches the problem description for the given test cases and does not rely on any external assertions. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and no other edge cases were found that would make it incorrect, the program is considered correct.
