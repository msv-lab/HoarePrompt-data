Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It iterates over the indices of the string, selecting only those characters whose indices are even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ...), and concatenates them into a new string. The assertions provided in the program cover various cases, including an even-length string (`'abcdef'`), an odd-length string (`'python'`), a short string (`'data'`), and another string with an even number of characters (`'lambs'`). All these examples show that the function works as intended according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
