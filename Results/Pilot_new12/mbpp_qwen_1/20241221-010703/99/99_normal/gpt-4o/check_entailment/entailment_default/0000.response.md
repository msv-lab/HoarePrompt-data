Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s` and includes only those characters where the index is even. This matches the problem description exactly. The examples given (`'abcdef' -> 'ace'`, `'python' -> 'pto'`, `'data' -> 'dt'`, `'lambs' -> 'lms'`) all demonstrate the expected behavior. The function handles both empty strings and strings of odd or even length correctly without any issues. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
