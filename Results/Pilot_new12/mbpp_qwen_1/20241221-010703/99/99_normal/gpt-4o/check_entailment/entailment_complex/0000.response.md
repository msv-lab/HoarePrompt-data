Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes characters from the given string that have odd index values, returning a new string that consists of characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

- The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s`.
- For each index `i`, it checks if `i % 2 == 0` (i.e., if the index is even).
- If the condition is true, the character at that index is included in the resulting string.
- The `''.join()` method is used to concatenate these characters into a single string.

The program handles all potential cases as per the problem description:
- It works correctly for strings of various lengths (including empty strings).
- It selects every second character starting from the first character, which matches the requirement.
- No additional checks or error handling are needed since the input is assumed to be valid.

Therefore, the program is correct and always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
