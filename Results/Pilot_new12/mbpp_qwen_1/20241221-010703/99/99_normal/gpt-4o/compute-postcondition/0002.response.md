Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting with the first character. The function achieves this by iterating over the indices of the string `s` and selecting characters whose indices are even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ...). There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function will correctly handle empty strings and strings of odd or even length without any additional checks needed. The function does not modify the original string `s`; instead, it creates and returns a new string based on the selected characters.**
