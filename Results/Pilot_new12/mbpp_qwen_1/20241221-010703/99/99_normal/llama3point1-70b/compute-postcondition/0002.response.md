Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character. This means it skips every other character starting from the beginning of the string. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that need special handling; however, the function assumes that `s` is a valid string. If `s` is an empty string or a string with only one character, the function will still return a string with every second character, which would be the original string itself.**

- The function uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over every second character in the string `s`, starting from the first character (index 0).
- It returns a new string composed of these characters.
- The function does not modify the original string `s`; it creates and returns a new string based on the input.
