Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. It achieves this by iterating over the string with a step of 2 (`range(0, len(s), 2)`) which starts at index 0 (an even index) and includes every second character. The function then joins these selected characters back into a string using `''.join()`. This precisely matches the problem description, which states: "Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string."

Since the function behaves as expected for any valid input string, and the problem description aligns with the implementation, the program is correct.
