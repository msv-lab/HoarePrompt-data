Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This approach ensures that all characters at odd indices are omitted, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function behaves as expected for any given string, there is no potential case found where the program does not work as intended according to the problem description.
