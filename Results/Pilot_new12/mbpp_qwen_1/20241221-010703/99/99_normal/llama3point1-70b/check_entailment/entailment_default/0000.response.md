Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function `func_1(s)` uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string `s` with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This effectively skips every other character starting from the first character of the string. The function handles all potential cases, including an empty string or a string with only one character, by returning the original string itself. Since the problem description asks to remove characters with odd index values, the function correctly achieves this by keeping characters with even index values. The code does not require any additional edge case handling as per the problem description and works correctly for all valid inputs.
