Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This satisfies the requirement of removing characters with odd index values. The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. There are no specific edge cases mentioned that require special handling, and the function works as intended for valid input strings. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
