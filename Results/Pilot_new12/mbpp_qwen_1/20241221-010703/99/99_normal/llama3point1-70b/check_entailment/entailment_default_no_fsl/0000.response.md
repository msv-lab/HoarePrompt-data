Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s`. It achieves this by iterating over the string and including only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The function works as expected for various cases, including:

- An empty string (`""`), which results in an empty string.
- A single-character string (`"a"`), which also results in an empty string because there are no characters at even indices beyond the first one.
- A multi-character string like `"abcdef"`, which results in `"ace"`.

The function does not need to handle any additional edge cases as described in the problem statement and output hints. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
