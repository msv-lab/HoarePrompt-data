Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It iterates over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0, which effectively keeps only the characters at even indices. This satisfies the requirement of removing characters with odd index values. Since there is no potential case found where the program does not work as expected, the code is correct.
