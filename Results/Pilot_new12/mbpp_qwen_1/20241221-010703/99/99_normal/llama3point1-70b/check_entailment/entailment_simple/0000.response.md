Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character (i.e., characters at even indices if counting starts from 0). This is achieved using a generator expression within the `join` method, which iterates over the string with a step of 2 (`range(0, len(s), 2)`). Therefore, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description for any valid string input.
