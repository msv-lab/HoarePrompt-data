Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` iterates over the string `s` using a step of 2 in the range function, effectively selecting every second character starting from the first character (index 0). This matches the problem description of removing characters with odd index values, as those are the characters that would have been selected had the range started at 1 with a step of 2. The function handles all valid strings correctly and produces the expected output. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is supported by the annotated version.
