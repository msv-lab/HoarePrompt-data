Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the string, selecting only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that need special handling, and the function behaves as expected for any valid string input. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
