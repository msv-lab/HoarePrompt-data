Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether the string `s` contains the character 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input.
2. It checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]` using the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])`.
3. If 'z' is found in the substring, it returns `True`.
4. If 'z' is not found in the substring, it returns `False`.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The substring `pythonzabc. [1:-1]` is `ythonzabc`, and 'z' is present, so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The substring `zxyabc. [1:-1]` is `xyzab`, and 'z' is not present, so the function returns `False`.
- `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: The substring `  lang  . [1:-1]` is ` lang `, and 'z' is not present, so the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible cases of valid input strings.
