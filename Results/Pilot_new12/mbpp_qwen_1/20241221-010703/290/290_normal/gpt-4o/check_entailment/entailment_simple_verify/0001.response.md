Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function should check if the string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks if 'z' is present within the substring `s[1:-1]`. This means that if 'z' is at the start or end of the string, the function will incorrectly return `False`.

For example:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` should return `False` because 'z' is at the end of the string, but the function will return `True`.
- `func_1('zpython')` should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, but the function will return `True`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function only checks the substring `s[1:-1]`, which does not satisfy the requirement of excluding 'z' from the start and end of the string. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
