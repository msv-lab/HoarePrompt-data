Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not check if 'z' is present anywhere except at the start and end of the string. It only checks if 'z' is present within the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means 'z' can still appear at the beginning or end of the string, and the program will return `False` in such cases. For example:

- `func_1('pythonzabc')` should return `False` because 'z' is at the end of the string.
- `func_1('zpython')` should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.

These cases violate the problem description, so the program is incorrect.
