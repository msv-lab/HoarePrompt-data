Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the substring `s[1:-1]` contains the character 'z'. This matches the problem description, which states that the function should check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The provided test cases (`'pythonzabc.'`, `'zxyabc.'`, and `'  lang  .`) demonstrate that the function behaves as intended. The output hints also confirm that the function is designed to check for 'z' in the middle portion of the string, which further supports the correctness of the original assessment.
