Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the string contains 'z' at the start or end of the word. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` if 'z' appears at the start or end of the word. However, the current implementation only checks for 'z' within the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters. This means the function will incorrectly return `True` for strings like `'pzxzy'` or `'xyzpz'`, where 'z' is at the start or end but not excluded from the check. 

For example, `func_1('pzxzy')` should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the word, but the current implementation will return `True`.
