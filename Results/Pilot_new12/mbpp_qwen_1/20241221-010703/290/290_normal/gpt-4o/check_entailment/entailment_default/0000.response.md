Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of the string `s` excluding the first and last characters (`s[1:-1]`). Based on the given assertions:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This is correct because 'z' is present in the substring 'ython'.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: This is correct because 'z' is not present in the substring 'xabc'.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This is correct because 'z' is not present in the substring ' lang '.

The output hints confirm that the function checks for the presence of 'z' within the middle portion of the string (excluding the first and last characters), which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code handles all potential cases correctly under the given assumptions.
