Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' at positions other than the first and last characters. This matches the problem description accurately. The function uses the slice `s[1:-1]` to check the substring excluding the first and last characters, and returns `True` if 'z' is found within this slice. Given the test cases:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True`, which is correct because 'z' is inside the middle part of the string.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False`, which is correct because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False`, which is correct because 'z' is not present in the string.

Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and there are no edge cases identified that would cause it to fail, the function is correct.
