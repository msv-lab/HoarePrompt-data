Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the string `s` contains the character 'z' anywhere inside the string, excluding the first and last characters. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function uses the slice `s[1:-1]` to exclude the first and last characters of the string.
   - It then checks if 'z' is present in this sliced portion of the string using the `in` operator.
   - If 'z' is found within `s[1:-1]`, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - For `func_1('pythonzabc.')`: The substring `s[1:-1]` is `'ythonzabc'`, which contains 'z'. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
   - For `func_1('zxyabc.')`: The substring `s[1:-1]` is `'xyabc'`, which does not contain 'z'. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
   - For `func_1('  lang  .')`: The substring `s[1:-1]` is `' ang '`, which does not contain 'z'. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

The provided test cases cover all necessary scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
