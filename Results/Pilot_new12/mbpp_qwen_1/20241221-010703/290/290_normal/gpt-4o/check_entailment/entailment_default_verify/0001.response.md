Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The provided function only checks if 'z' is present within the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means 'z' can still appear at the beginning or end of the string, causing the function to return `False` in such cases. For example, `func_1('pythonzabc')` and `func_1('zpython')` should both return `False` according to the problem description, but they would return `False` and `False` respectively, which is correct for the current implementation, but the function does not fully implement the intended logic of checking 'z' except at the start and end. The function does not exclude the possibility of 'z' being at the start or end, thus violating the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
