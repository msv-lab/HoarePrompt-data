Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if the substring `s[1:-1]` contains the character `'z'`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks for the presence of `'z'` within the middle portion of the string (excluding the first and last characters), and based on this check, it returns either `True` or `False`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the string `s` is empty (`""`), the function will return `False` because `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string.
- If the string `s` has fewer than 3 characters (`"a"` or `"ab"`), the function will also return `False` for the same reason.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The current implementation does not handle the case where `s` consists of only one or two characters. In such cases, `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string, and the function should still return `False`.
