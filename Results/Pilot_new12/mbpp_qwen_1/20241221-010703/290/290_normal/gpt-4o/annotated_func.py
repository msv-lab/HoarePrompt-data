#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and 'z' is not in the substring s[1:-1]
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if the substring `s[1:-1]` contains the character `'z'`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks for the presence of `'z'` within the middle portion of the string (excluding the first and last characters), and based on this check, it returns either `True` or `False`.
