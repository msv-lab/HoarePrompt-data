Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Input**: The function takes a single string `s` as input, which matches the expected input type.

2. **Splitting the String**: The function splits the input string `s` into a list of words using `s.split()`. This step is necessary because the problem requires checking each word within the string, not the entire string at once.

3. **Iterating Over Words**: The function iterates over each word in the list of words. For each word:
   - It checks if the word has more than one character (`len(word) > 1`).
   - It then checks if the substring excluding the first and last characters (i.e., `word[1:-1]`) contains the letter 'z' (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).

4. **Returning True or False**: 
   - If any word satisfies both conditions (length greater than 1 and contains 'z' in all positions except the first and last), the function immediately returns `True`.
   - If no such word is found after iterating through all words, the function returns `False`.

5. **Output Type**: The function correctly returns `True` or `False` based on whether the condition is met for any word in the string. There is no mention of returning `None`, so the function adheres to the expected output type.

Given these points, the function accurately checks if any word in the string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word, thereby meeting the problem description.
