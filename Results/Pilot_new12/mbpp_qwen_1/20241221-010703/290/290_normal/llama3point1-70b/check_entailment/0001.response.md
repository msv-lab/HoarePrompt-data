Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) for each word in the input string. Given the problem description, the function only needs to check if 'z' appears in the middle part of each word. The function splits the input string into words and iterates over them, checking the specified condition. Since the function adheres to the problem description without any apparent edge cases being missed, it can be considered correct.
