Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function splits the input string into words and checks each word to see if it contains 'z' in any position except the first and last character. The function returns `True` if such a word is found and `False` otherwise. Given the problem description and the annotated version, the function behaves as intended and handles the case where the input is a valid string, which is our assumption. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
