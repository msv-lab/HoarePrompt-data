Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character of each word. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if any word in the split string meets the criteria and `False` otherwise. Since the problem description asks for the function to check if a string contains 'z' (excluding the first and last character of each word), and the function logic aligns with this requirement, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
