Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Function Input**: The function takes a single string `s` as input, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Splitting the String**: The function splits the input string `s` into a list of words using `s.split()`, ensuring each word is processed individually.
3. **Iterating Over Words**: For each word in the list, the function checks if the word's length is greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`) and whether the substring excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`) contains the letter 'z'.
4. **Returning `True` or `False`**: 
   - If any word meets the criteria (length > 1 and contains 'z' in the middle), the function immediately returns `True`.
   - If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The function does not return `None` under any circumstances; instead, it consistently returns either `True` or `False`. This aligns with the requirement of returning `True` if any word has a length greater than 1 and contains 'z' in any position except the first and last character, and `False` otherwise.

Since the function accurately implements the described behavior for all possible valid inputs, the program is correct.
