Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the word itself is shorter than 3 characters (i.e., it does not check if the word length is greater than 1 before attempting to access `word[1:-1]`). This can lead to an `IndexError`. For example, if the input string is `"az"` or `"z"`, the program will raise an error because it tries to access indices outside the bounds of the string. The correct implementation should include a check for the word length before accessing `word[1:-1]`.
