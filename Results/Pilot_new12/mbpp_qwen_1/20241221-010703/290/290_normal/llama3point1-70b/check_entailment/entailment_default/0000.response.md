Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It splits the input string into words and checks each word to see if it contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character. If such a word is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `True` if any word within the string has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character. There are no potential cases mentioned in the hints or the problem description where the code would fail to meet the requirements.
