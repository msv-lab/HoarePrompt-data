Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment suggests that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last character of each word). However, based on the annotated version and the problem description, there is a discrepancy. The problem description requires the function to return `True` if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last character of each word), and `False` otherwise. 

In the annotated version, it is mentioned that the function returns `None` after the for loop, which means the function does not correctly implement the requirement. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment should be revised to reflect this. The correct implementation should return `False` if no such 'z' is found and `True` if it is found.
