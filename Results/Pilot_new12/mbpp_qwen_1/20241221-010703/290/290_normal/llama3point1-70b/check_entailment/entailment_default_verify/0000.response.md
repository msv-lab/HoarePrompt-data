Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function splits the input string into words and checks if any word contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character. The provided output hints confirm that the function returns `None` if no such word is found, which is consistent with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
