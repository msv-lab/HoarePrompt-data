Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last character of each word). It splits the input string into words and then iterates through each word, checking if 'z' is present in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. This approach ensures that 'z' is not checked at the start and end of each word, which aligns with the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any edge case that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem statement and examples.
