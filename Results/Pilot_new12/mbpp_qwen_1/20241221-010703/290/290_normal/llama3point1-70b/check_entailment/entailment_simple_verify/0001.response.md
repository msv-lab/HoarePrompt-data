Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks each word in the input string `s` to see if it contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters). The function splits the input string into words and iterates over them, returning `True` if any word meets the criteria. If no such word is found, it returns `False`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires checking if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
