Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` returns `True` if any word within the string has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character. However, the function actually returns `False` in this case. The function is currently set up to return `True` if any word meets the criteria, but it should return `True` only if at least one word meets the criteria. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the problem description. The correct implementation should modify the return statement to reflect the presence of a word meeting the criteria rather than just checking for its existence. 

Given the output hints and the problem description, the function should return `True` if any word has 'z' in the middle, and `False` otherwise. Since the function returns `True` regardless, it does not meet the problem description accurately. Thus, the original assessment is not correct, and the final assessment is **False**.
