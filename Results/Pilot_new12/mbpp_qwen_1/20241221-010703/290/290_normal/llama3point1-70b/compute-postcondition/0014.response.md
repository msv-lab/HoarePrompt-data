Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if any word within the string has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last character. If no such word is found, the function returns `None`.**

This summary covers all potential cases based on the actual code:
- The function splits the input string `s` into a list of words.
- It then iterates over each word, checking if its length is greater than 1 and if it contains the letter 'z' in any position other than the first and last character.
- If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
- If no suitable word is found after examining all words, the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality (if any) are already covered by the summary since the code itself does not have any missing logic or edge cases not accounted for in the summary.
