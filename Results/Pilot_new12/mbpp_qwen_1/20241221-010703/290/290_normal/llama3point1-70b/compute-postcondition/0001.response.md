State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from the string `s` that must have at least one word**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each word in the `words` list.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the `words` list must contain at least one element (i.e., one word).
3. The variable `s` is mentioned as a string, but it does not directly control the loop's execution. It is used to create the `words` list, but the loop itself depends on the contents of `words`.
4. Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to ensure that `words` has at least one word to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `words` must have at least one word.
