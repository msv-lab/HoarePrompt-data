Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are both tuples containing integers. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will only perform the bitwise AND operation up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially truncating the longer tuple. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.**
