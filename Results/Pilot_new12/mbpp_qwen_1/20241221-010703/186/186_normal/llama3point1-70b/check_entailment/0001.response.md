Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples using a generator expression inside a tuple constructor. However, this approach will not work as intended for non-integer elements in the tuples. According to the problem description, the function should handle any type of elements in the tuples, not just integers. For instance, if the tuples contain elements that are not integers, the bitwise AND operation will raise a `TypeError`.

Here is an example of a case where the program fails:

```python
tup1 = ('a', 'b')
tup2 = ('c', 'd')
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Expected behavior is undefined, but it will raise TypeError
```

Since the program does not handle non-integer elements properly and may raise an error for such inputs, the program is incorrect.
