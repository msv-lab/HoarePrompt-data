Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to extract the element-wise bitwise AND of the given two tuples. Here's why:

- The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as inputs.
- It uses the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
- For each pair `(x, y)` of elements, it performs the bitwise AND operation using the `&` operator.
- The result is a generator expression that produces a sequence of these bitwise AND results.
- This sequence is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple` function and returned.

Since the function accurately performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns a tuple with these results, it fully meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
