You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples using a generator expression inside a tuple constructor. However, this approach will not work as intended for non-integer elements in the tuples. According to the problem description, the function should handle any type of elements in the tuples, not just integers. For instance, if the tuples contain elements that are not integers, the bitwise AND operation will raise a `TypeError`.

Here is an example of a case where the program fails:

```python
tup1 = ('a', 'b')
tup2 = ('c', 'd')
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Expected behavior is undefined, but it will raise TypeError
```

Since the program does not handle non-integer elements properly and may raise an error for such inputs, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are both tuples containing integers. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will only perform the bitwise AND operation up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially truncating the longer tuple. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
