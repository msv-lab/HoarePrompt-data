Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` ensures that the function processes elements pair-wise, and the generator expression `(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))` correctly computes the bitwise AND for each pair of elements. The function returns a tuple containing these results, which aligns with the requirement to extract the element-wise results into a tuple. Additionally, the provided explanation accurately captures the behavior and assumptions of the function, confirming that it meets the problem description.
