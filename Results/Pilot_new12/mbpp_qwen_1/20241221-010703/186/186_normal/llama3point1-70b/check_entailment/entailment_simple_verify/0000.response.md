Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description requires the program to extract the element-wise pairs from the given two tuples, not to perform a bitwise AND operation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program is not meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
