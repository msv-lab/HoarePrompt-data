Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operator between corresponding elements of the two tuples, which is not the intended operation for extracting element-wise values. According to the problem description, the goal is to extract the elements from the given two tuples directly, not perform a bitwise AND operation.

For example, consider the input tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`. The program will compute `(1 & 4, 2 & 5, 3 & 6)` which results in `(0, 2, 6)`, but the expected output should be `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))`.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This would correctly extract the element-wise pairs from the two tuples.
