Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. However, the problem description requires the function to extract the element-wise pairs from the given two tuples, not to perform a bitwise AND operation. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation, which does not match the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
