Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract "elementwise and tuples" from the given two tuples, which implies that the output should be two separate tuples: one containing the results of the bitwise AND operations and another possibly containing the original elements before the operation. 

The given code only returns a single tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operations. This means it does not meet the requirement to extract "elementwise and tuples," as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
