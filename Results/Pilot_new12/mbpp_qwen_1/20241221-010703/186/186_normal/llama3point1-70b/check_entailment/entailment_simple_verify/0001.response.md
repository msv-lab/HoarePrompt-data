Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) which is only applicable to integers. According to the problem description, the function should handle any type of elements in the tuples, not just integers. The annotated version of the code does not address this issue and does not explain how non-integer elements should be handled. Therefore, the program will raise a `TypeError` for non-integer elements, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
