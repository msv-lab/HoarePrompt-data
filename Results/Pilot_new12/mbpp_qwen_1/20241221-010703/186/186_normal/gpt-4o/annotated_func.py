#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples with the same length.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing elements that are the logical AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are required to be tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that for each pair of elements (a, b) from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, the function computes `a & b` and includes the result in the returned tuple. If either `a` or `b` is `False`, the result will be `False`; otherwise, it will be `True`.

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If one or both input tuples are empty, the function will still execute correctly and return an empty tuple.
2. If the input tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `zip` function will stop at the shortest input tuple, leading to incomplete processing of the longer tuple.
