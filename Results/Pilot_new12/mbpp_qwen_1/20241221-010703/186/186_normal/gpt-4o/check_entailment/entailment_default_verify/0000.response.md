Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is intended to perform an element-wise logical AND operation between two tuples. However, the original assessment is correct because the provided code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the logical AND operator (`and`). The output hints also indicate that the function returns the result of the bitwise AND operation, which does not align with the problem description. The example cases provided in the original assessment demonstrate that the function is not performing the logical AND operation as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
