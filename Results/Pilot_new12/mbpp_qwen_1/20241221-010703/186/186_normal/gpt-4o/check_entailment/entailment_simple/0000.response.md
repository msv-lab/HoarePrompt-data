Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The problem description asks to extract the element-wise and (logical AND) of the given two tuples. However, the provided implementation uses the bitwise AND operator `&` instead of the logical AND operator `and`. 

In Python, the bitwise AND operator `&` operates on the binary representation of integers, while the logical AND operator `and` returns a boolean value based on the truthiness of the operands.

For example:
- `1 & 1` results in `1` (bitwise AND).
- `True and True` results in `True` (logical AND).

Given the test cases:
- `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)` would be `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3)` which is `(0b1010 & 0b0101, 0b0100 & 0b0010, 0b0110 & 0b0011, 0b1001 & 0b0011)` resulting in `(8, 0, 6, 9)`, which is not equal to the expected outputs `(0, 0, 2, 1)` or `(1, 2, 3, 0)` or `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

To correctly implement the problem description, the logical AND should be used instead of the bitwise AND. The correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a and b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

This version will correctly perform a logical AND operation on the elements of the tuples, matching the problem description.
