Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The annotations clearly indicate that the function returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the input tuples. The provided assertions cover various cases, including both non-zero and zero results, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct based on the given information.
