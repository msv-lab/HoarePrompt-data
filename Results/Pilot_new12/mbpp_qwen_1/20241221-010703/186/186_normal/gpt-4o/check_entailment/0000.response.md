Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to compute the element-wise AND of two tuples. However, the problem description does not specify that the operation should be a bitwise AND. Instead, it should extract elements from the tuples where the corresponding elements are equal. The provided assertions do not cover this scenario. For instance, consider the following input:

```python
func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4))
```

The expected output would be `(1, 2, 3, 4)` since each element in both tuples is equal. However, the current implementation will return `(0, 0, 0, 0)` because `a & b` for equal elements results in `a` itself, and the tuple comprehension returns zeros for non-matching elements.

To fix this, the program should compare the elements directly instead of using the bitwise AND operator:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a if a == b else 0 for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

This corrected version would handle the specified problem correctly.
