Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the goal is to extract elements from the given tuples where the corresponding elements are equal. The provided annotated version of the code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of comparing the elements directly. This results in incorrect behavior for the given test cases. For example, the first assertion `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)` would yield `(0, 0, 2, 9)` instead of `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. The corrected version of the function should compare elements directly:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a if a == b else 0 for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

Since the original code does not implement the intended functionality, the original assessment is accurate.
