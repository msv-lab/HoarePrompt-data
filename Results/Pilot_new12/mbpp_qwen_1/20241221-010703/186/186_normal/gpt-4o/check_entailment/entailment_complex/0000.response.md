Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are required to be tuples of the same length. This aligns with the requirement to extract elements from two tuples.

2. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to compute the logical AND (`&`) of corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The `zip` function pairs up the elements from both tuples, ensuring that each element in the resulting tuple is the result of the logical AND operation between corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

3. The program handles all valid cases as per the problem description. It correctly returns a tuple containing the results of the logical AND operations for all pairs of elements from the input tuples. It also handles the edge case where the input tuples are empty, returning an empty tuple.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
