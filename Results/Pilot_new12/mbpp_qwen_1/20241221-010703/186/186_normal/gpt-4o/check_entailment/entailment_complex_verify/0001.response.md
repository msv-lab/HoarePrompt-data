Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns the results as a tuple. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including cases where the result of the bitwise AND operation is non-zero and zero. The annotated version further clarifies that the function handles the expected operations and edge cases such as empty tuples and tuples of different lengths. Given that the problem description aligns with the function's behavior and the annotations support this, the program is correct.
