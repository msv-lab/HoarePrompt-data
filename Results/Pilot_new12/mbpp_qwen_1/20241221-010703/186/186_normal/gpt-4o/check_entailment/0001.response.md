Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within a tuple to perform bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The function then returns the result as a new tuple. 

The assertions provided in the problem description cover different scenarios:
1. The first assertion checks a case where the result of the bitwise AND operation produces a non-zero value.
2. The second assertion checks a case where the result of the bitwise AND operation for some elements is zero.
3. The third assertion checks another case with different values.

Given these examples, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or additional test cases that would reveal a flaw in the current implementation. Therefore, the function seems to handle the described operation correctly for the given inputs.
