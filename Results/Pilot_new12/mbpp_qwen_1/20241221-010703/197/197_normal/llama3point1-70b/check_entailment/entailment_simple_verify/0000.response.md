Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version clarifies that the function `func_1` iterates over each element in the list `lst` and counts its occurrences within the tuple `tup`, then sums these counts. This approach correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to fail under valid input conditions, as assumed in the original assessment. Thus, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
