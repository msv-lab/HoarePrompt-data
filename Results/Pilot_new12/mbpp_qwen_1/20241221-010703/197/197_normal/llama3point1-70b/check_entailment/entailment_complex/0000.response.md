Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that are found within `tup`. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters, a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`.
2. **Comprehension and Count Method**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst` and counts how many times each element appears in `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` returns 0, which does not affect the sum.
3. **Summation**: The `sum` function adds up all these counts, providing the total number of occurrences of elements from `lst` within `tup`.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrence of all elements of `lst` in `tup` and returning the sum of these counts. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
