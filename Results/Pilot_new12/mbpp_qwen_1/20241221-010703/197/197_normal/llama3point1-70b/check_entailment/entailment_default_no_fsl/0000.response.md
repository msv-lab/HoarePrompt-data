Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not actually count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. Instead, it sums the counts of each element in `lst` regardless of whether they exist in `tup` or not. This means that even if an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, the function still returns a count, which is not what the problem description requires. 

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `lst = [2, 5]`. The function should return `{2: 1, 5: 0}` indicating that '2' appears once in the tuple and '5' does not appear at all. However, the current implementation will simply return the sum of counts, which would be `1 + 0 = 1`.

To fix this, the function should return a dictionary where the keys are the elements from `lst` and the values are their respective counts in `tup`. Here is an example of how the corrected function could look:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```

This corrected function will accurately count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup` and return a dictionary with the results.
