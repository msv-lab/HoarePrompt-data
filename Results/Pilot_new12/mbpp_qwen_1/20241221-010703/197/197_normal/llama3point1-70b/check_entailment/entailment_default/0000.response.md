Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst` and counts the occurrences of each element within `tup` using the `count` method. These counts are then summed up and returned. The output hints confirm that the function calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that are found within `tup`, considering the count of elements not present in `tup` as 0. There are no potential cases identified where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
