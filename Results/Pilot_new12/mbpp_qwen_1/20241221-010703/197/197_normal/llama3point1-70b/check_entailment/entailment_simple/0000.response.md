Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list), which aligns with the problem description asking for a function that counts the occurrences of elements from a list in a tuple.

2. **Logic**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. Specifically:
   - `element in lst` iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
   - `tup.count(element)` counts how many times the current element from `lst` appears in the tuple `tup`.
   - `sum(...)` sums up these counts to give the total number of occurrences of all elements in `lst` within `tup`.

3. **Output**: The function returns a single integer value representing the total count, which is consistent with the problem description requiring a count of occurrences.

Since the program accurately performs the specified operation and handles the inputs as required, it satisfies the problem description for all valid cases. Therefore, the correctness is True.
