Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program does not meet the requirements. The function `func_1` currently returns a single integer value which is the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within `tup`. However, the problem description specifies that the function should count the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple and return a dictionary showing these counts. The provided implementation does not return a dictionary, and it sums up the counts, which leads to incorrect results when some elements in the list are not present in the tuple. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
