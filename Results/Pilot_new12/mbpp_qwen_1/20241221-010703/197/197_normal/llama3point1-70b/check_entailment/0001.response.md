Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the elements in the list do not exist in the tuple. According to the problem description, the function should count the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple. However, the current implementation uses `tup.count(element)` which will return 0 for elements not present in the tuple. This means the function will always return 0 for non-existent elements in the list, which is not what the problem description requires.

To fix this, the function should either raise an error for non-existent elements or return a dictionary showing the counts for each element. Here's an example case where the program fails:

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = [1, 2, 5]
print(func_1(tup, lst))  # Expected output: {1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 0}
```

The program will output `3` instead of `{1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 0}` because it sums up the counts without distinguishing between elements that exist and those that don't.
