Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function, stating that it calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that are found within `tup`. Even though the annotations mention that if an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0, this is inherently handled by the `tup.count(element)` method, which returns 0 if the element is not found in the tuple. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program meets the problem description.
