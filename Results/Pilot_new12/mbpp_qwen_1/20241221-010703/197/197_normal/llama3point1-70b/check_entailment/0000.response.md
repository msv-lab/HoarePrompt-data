Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst` and counts its occurrences using `tup.count(element)`. The `sum` function then adds up these counts.

This approach correctly handles all elements in `lst` and their respective counts in `tup`. There are no edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to fail based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
