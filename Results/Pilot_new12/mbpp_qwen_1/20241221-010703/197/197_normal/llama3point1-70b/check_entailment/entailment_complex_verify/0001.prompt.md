You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the elements in the list do not exist in the tuple. According to the problem description, the function should count the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple. However, the current implementation uses `tup.count(element)` which will return 0 for elements not present in the tuple. This means the function will always return 0 for non-existent elements in the list, which is not what the problem description requires.

To fix this, the function should either raise an error for non-existent elements or return a dictionary showing the counts for each element. Here's an example case where the program fails:

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = [1, 2, 5]
print(func_1(tup, lst))  # Expected output: {1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 0}
```

The program will output `3` instead of `{1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 0}` because it sums up the counts without distinguishing between elements that exist and those that don't.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that are found within `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. The function iterates over each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method of `tup` to find the number of occurrences of that element in `tup`. These counts are then summed up and returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
