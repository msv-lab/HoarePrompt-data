Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that are found within `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. The function iterates over each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method of `tup` to find the number of occurrences of that element in `tup`. These counts are then summed up and returned.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `lst` contains elements that are not present in `tup`, their count is 0 and does not contribute to the sum.
- If either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function returns 0 since there are no elements to count.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code. The code accurately reflects the described functionality and postconditions.
