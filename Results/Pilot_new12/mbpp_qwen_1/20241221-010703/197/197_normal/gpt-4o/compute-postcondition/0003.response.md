Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup` and returns the sum of these counts. The function handles the case where `tup` might be empty or `elements` might be an empty list, returning 0 in such scenarios. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the code that need to be addressed.**
