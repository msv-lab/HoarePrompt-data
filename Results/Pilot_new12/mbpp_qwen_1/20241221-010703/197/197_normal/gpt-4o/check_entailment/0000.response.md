Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the given list within the tuple. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the `elements` list and sums up the counts of these elements in the tuple using the `count` method. This approach ensures that all occurrences are counted, including multiple instances of the same element.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:
- For `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`, the function returns 3 because there are two 'a's and one 'b' in the tuple.
- For `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6`, the function returns 6 because there are three '1's, two '4's, and one '7' in the tuple.
- For `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2`, the function returns 2 because there is one '1' and one '2' in the tuple.

Since the function handles the provided examples correctly and the logic appears sound, there are no apparent issues or edge cases that the function fails to address based on the problem description.
