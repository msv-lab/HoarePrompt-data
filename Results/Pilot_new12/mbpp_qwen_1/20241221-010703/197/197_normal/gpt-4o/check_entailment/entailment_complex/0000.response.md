Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts the occurrences of each element in `elements` within the tuple `tup` and returns the sum of these counts.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes valid inputs (tuple and list) and does not explicitly handle invalid input cases like non-tuple or non-list inputs, which aligns with the assumption stated in the problem description.

2. **Functionality**: 
   - For each element in the list `elements`, the function uses `tup.count(element)` to count how many times the element appears in the tuple `tup`.
   - These individual counts are summed up using `sum()`, resulting in the total number of occurrences of all elements in `elements` within `tup`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `tup` is an empty tuple or `elements` is an empty list, the function returns 0 because there are no elements to count. This aligns with the expected behavior.

Given the problem description and the function's implementation, the function consistently meets the requirement to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
