Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It counts the occurrences of each element in the list `elements` within the tuple `tup` and returns the sum of these counts. The output hints also confirm that the function handles the cases where either `tup` or `elements` might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the code that need to be addressed. Therefore, the code seems to work correctly for every potential case as per the problem description.
