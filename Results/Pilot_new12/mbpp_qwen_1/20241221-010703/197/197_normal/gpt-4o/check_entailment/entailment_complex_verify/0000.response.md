Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the given list within the tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected. The annotated version further clarifies that the function handles the case where `tup` might be empty or `elements` might be an empty list, returning 0 in such scenarios. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the code that need to be addressed. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
