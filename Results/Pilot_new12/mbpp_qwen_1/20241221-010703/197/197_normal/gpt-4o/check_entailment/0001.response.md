Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count each element's occurrence and sums them up. This approach ensures that the function works for any tuple and list of elements as described in the problem statement. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including repeated elements and different data types, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
