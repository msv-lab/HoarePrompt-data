Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and counts the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. The sum of these counts is returned. The code handles the case where `tup` or `elements` might be empty, returning 0 in such scenarios. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the code that need to be addressed based on the given assertions and output hints. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs.
