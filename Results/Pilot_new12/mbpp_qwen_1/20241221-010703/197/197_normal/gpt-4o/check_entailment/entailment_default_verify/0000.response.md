Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the given list within the tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as empty tuples or lists by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description of counting the occurrences of elements in a tuple. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected in typical use cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
