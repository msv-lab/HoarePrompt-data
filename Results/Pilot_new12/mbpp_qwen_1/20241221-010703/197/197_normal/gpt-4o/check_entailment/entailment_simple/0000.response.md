Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and counts the total number of occurrences of the elements in `elements` within the tuple `tup`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list). This matches the requirement to count the occurrences of all elements of a list within a tuple.

2. **Count Calculation**: The function uses a generator expression `tup.count(element) for element in elements` to count how many times each element in the `elements` list appears in the tuple `tup`. The `sum` function then adds up these counts, giving the total number of occurrences.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions check the function with different inputs and expected outputs:
   - `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`: The elements 'a' and 'b' appear 2 and 1 times respectively, totaling 3.
   - `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6`: The elements 1, 4, and 7 appear 3, 2, and 1 times respectively, totaling 6.
   - `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2`: The elements 1 and 2 appear 1 and 1 time respectively, totaling 2.

These examples demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given test cases. Since the problem description requires counting the occurrences of elements from a list within a tuple, and the provided implementation accurately performs this task, the program is correct.
