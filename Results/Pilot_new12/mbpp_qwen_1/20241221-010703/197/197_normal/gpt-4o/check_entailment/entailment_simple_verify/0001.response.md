Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each element in `elements`, counts its occurrences in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`, and sums these counts. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
