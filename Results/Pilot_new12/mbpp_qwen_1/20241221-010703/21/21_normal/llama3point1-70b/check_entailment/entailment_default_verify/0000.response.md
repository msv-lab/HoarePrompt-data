Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles the case where the list is empty by returning `None`, which is a reasonable default behavior for such functions. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, and the provided function meets this requirement for all valid inputs (non-empty lists of numbers), the program is correct. The original assessment correctly identifies the function's accuracy based on the given specifications and expected behavior.
