Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the minimum value from the list. Although the annotation mentions handling the case where `nums` is empty by returning `None`, this is not explicitly coded in the provided function. However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, we can infer that the function meets the requirements for all described cases, even though it does not return `None` for an empty list. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
