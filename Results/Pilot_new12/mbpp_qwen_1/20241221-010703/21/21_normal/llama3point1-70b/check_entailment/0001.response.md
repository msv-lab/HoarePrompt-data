Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This function will work correctly for any non-empty list of numbers. If the list is empty, `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, but the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, so we assume it is valid to return a value (e.g., `None` or raising an error) for non-empty lists. Since the function meets the requirements for all described cases, the correctness is True.
