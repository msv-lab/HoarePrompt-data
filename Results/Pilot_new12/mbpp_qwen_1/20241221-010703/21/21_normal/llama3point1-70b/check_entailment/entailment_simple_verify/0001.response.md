Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that `nums` is a list of integers before the function call. The `min()` function is used correctly to find and return the smallest number in the list. The problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, and the provided function meets this requirement. While the function does not explicitly handle an empty list, the original assessment correctly notes that this omission is acceptable under the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of numbers). Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the annotated code.
