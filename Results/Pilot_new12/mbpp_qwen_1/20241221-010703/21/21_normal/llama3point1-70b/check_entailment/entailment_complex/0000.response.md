Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the minimum value from the list using the built-in `min()` function. According to the problem description, the task is to write a Python function to find the smallest number in a list, which is exactly what the `func_1` function does. The program also implicitly handles the case where the list might be empty by returning `None`, which is a valid response when the input list is empty. Since the input list is assumed to be valid and non-erroneous, the program adheres to the problem description in all cases.
