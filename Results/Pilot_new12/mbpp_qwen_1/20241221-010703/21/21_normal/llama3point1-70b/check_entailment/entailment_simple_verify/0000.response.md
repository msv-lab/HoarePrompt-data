Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in a list of integers. The annotated version of the code confirms that `nums` is a list of integers before the function call, which aligns with the problem description asking for finding the smallest number in a list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
