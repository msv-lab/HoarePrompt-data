Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `nums` is empty by returning `None`, which aligns with the problem description's assumption that we can validly return a value for non-empty lists. There are no mentioned edge cases or missing functionalities that would render the program incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness as True is appropriate.
