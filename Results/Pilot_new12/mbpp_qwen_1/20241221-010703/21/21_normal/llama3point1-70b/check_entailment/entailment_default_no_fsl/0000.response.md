Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. According to the problem description, the function needs to handle the case where `nums` is empty by returning `None`, which is correctly implemented in the code. There are no other edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that this code does not address. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described.
