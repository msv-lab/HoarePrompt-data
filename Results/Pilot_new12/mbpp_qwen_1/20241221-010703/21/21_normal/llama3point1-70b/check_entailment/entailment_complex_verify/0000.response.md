Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list of integers. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the case where `nums` is empty by returning `None`, which is a reasonable default behavior for such a function. Given the problem description asks for finding the smallest number in a list, and the provided function meets this requirement for all possible valid inputs (non-empty lists of numbers), the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
