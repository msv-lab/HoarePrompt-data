Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min()` function. This function will work for any non-empty list of numbers and will return the smallest element. Since the problem description asks for finding the smallest number in a list, and the provided function meets this requirement for all possible inputs (non-empty lists of numbers), the program is correct.
