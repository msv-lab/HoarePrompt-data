Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min()` function. Since the problem description only states that the function should find the smallest number in a list of integers, and the provided function correctly implements this functionality without any additional constraints or edge cases that would invalidate its correctness under the given assumptions, the program is correct.
