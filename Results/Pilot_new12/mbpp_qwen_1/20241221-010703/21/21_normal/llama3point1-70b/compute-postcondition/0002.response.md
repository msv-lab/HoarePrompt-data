Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the minimum value from the list. It handles the case where `nums` is empty by returning `None`. There is no missing functionality or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
- It uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the minimum value in the list.
- If `nums` is an empty list, `min(nums)` will raise a `ValueError`. However, the function does not handle this exception explicitly, so it will raise an error in such cases.
- The return postcondition accurately reflects the functionality described in the code. The function returns the minimum value from the list `nums`, or raises a `ValueError` if `nums` is empty.
