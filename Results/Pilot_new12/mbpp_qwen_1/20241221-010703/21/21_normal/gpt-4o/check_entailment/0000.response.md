Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function handles the problem description correctly and there are no edge cases identified that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
