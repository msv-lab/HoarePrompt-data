Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the minimum value from the list. Although the annotation mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, which is true, the original assessment does not mention this specific detail but still correctly concludes that the function is correct. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description.
