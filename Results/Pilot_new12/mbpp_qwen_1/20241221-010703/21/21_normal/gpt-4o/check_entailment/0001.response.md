Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The function is tested with three assertions, and it passes all of them. Given that the `min()` function works correctly for lists containing integers, and the provided test cases cover different scenarios (including a list with negative numbers and a list with positive numbers), we can infer that the function should work correctly for any list of integers. Since no specific edge cases or potential issues are identified beyond the provided tests, the function appears to meet the requirements for finding the smallest number in a list.
