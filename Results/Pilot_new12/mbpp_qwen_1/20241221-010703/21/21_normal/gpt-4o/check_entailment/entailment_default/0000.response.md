Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The function handles all the given test cases correctly:

- For the list `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the smallest number is `1`.
- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is `1`.
- For the list `[45, 46, 50, 60]`, the smallest number is `45`.

Since the function uses the `min()` method, it will return the smallest element in the list for any valid input list. The problem description specifies that the function should find the smallest number in a list, which is exactly what the function does. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would cause the function to fail, and the provided examples cover typical scenarios. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
