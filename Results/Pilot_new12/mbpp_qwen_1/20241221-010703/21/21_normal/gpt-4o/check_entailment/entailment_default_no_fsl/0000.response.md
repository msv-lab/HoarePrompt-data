Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that correctly finds and returns the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min` function. The problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, which is exactly what this function does. The provided assertions cover different scenarios (a list with multiple elements, a list with ascending numbers, and the smallest element being the first in the list), and the code handles these cases correctly. There is no indication in the problem description or the output hints that the function does not handle any potential cases correctly under the assumption of valid input.
