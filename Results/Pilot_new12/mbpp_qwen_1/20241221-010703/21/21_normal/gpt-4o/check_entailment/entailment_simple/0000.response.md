Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min()` function. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the correct smallest number for the given lists:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`.

The function correctly implements the requirement to find the smallest number in a list of integers. Since the problem description only requires the function to find the smallest number in a list and the provided implementation meets this requirement for all tested cases, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
