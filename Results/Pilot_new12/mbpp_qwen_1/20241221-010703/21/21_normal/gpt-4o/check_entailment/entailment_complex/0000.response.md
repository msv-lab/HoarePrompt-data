Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a list of integers. It uses the built-in `min()` function to accomplish this, which returns the minimum value from the list. The function does not modify the input list, adheres to the requirement that it should return the minimum value, and works correctly with the provided test cases:

- `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
- `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is the smallest number in the list.

Since the function behaves as expected and the problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, the program is correct.
