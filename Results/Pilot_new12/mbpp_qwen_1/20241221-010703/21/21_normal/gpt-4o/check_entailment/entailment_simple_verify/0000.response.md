Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list, which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the annotated version describes the state of the program accurately and the function handles the problem description correctly, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
