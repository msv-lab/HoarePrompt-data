Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` is correct, upon closer inspection and considering the output hints, the function does not correctly identify lists with consecutive numbers, especially in edge cases. Specifically, the function incorrectly returns `True` for an empty list or a list with a single element, as both the length of the list and the number of unique elements would be equal, satisfying the condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. However, such lists do not contain consecutive numbers. Therefore, the function fails to meet the problem description for these edge cases, making the original assessment inaccurate.
