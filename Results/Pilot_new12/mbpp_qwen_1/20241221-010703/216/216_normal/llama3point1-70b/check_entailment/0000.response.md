Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list, ensuring all numbers are in ascending order. Then, it uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to verify that each element (except the first one) is exactly one greater than its predecessor. Additionally, it ensures that the length of the list is equal to the size of the set of the list, which guarantees no duplicates exist. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers without duplicates. Since the program handles all cases correctly based on the provided problem description, the correctness is **True**.
