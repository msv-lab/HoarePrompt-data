Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list to ensure that consecutive numbers are adjacent and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1 using the `all()` function. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set of the list. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including handling edge cases like duplicate numbers and non-consecutive sequences. The annotations align with the function's logic and the problem description, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
