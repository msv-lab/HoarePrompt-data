Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when the input list has a single element. According to the problem description, a list with a single element should not be considered as containing consecutive numbers. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns `True` for such a list because the condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` is always satisfied (both sides are 1), and the sorting and consecutive check also pass trivially. This violates the problem description, hence the code is incorrect.
