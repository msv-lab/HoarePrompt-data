Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first sorts the list, ensuring that consecutive numbers will be adjacent. Then, it uses a generator expression with the `all()` function to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set of the list. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including handling edge cases like duplicate numbers and non-consecutive sequences. Since the function works correctly for all tested cases and the logic seems sound, the program is correct.
