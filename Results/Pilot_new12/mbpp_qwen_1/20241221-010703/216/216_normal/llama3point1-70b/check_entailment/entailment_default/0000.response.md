Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the list contains consecutive numbers but has duplicate values. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. However, the current implementation uses `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` to ensure all elements are unique, which means it will return `False` for lists containing duplicates, even if those duplicates are consecutive.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. The numbers in the list are consecutive, but the function will return `False` because there are duplicate elements. The function should only return `False` if the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

To fix this, the condition should be modified to ignore duplicates when checking for consecutive numbers. One way to achieve this is by using a set to keep track of the unique numbers and then checking the differences between them:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:  # Handle empty list
        return False
    lst.sort()
    unique_numbers = set(lst)
    if len(unique_numbers) != len(lst):  # Check for duplicates
        return False
    prev = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        if num - prev != 1:
            return False
        prev = num
    return True
```

This modified version ensures that the function correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, even if they contain duplicates.
