Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It first sorts the list using `lst.sort()`.
   - Then, it uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check two conditions:
     - The condition `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` ensures that each element in the sorted list is exactly one greater than its predecessor, indicating consecutive numbers.
     - The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that there are no duplicate elements in the list, which is necessary for the sequence to be truly consecutive.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that the numbers are in order, making it easier to verify consecutive numbers.
   - The generator expression iterates through the sorted list and checks the difference between consecutive elements.
   - The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that there are no duplicates, which is essential for the sequence to be considered consecutive.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles lists with duplicate values correctly because `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that all elements are unique.
   - The program can handle an empty list, as `len(lst)` and `len(set(lst))` would both evaluate to 0, and the `all()` function would return `True`.

Since the function correctly checks both the consecutive nature and uniqueness of the elements in the list, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
