Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It sorts the list and then checks if the difference between every consecutive pair of integers is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements, which helps handle cases with duplicate numbers. The potential edge cases mentioned in the annotation (an empty list or a list with a single element) are correctly handled by returning `False`, as the length of such lists cannot equal the number of unique elements under those conditions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
