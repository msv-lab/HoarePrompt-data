Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided program `func_1` aims to check if a list contains consecutive numbers, there is a logical flaw in the logic used to ensure no duplicates exist. The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` is redundant because after sorting, if the list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates, the sorted list will inherently consist of unique elements due to the nature of consecutive numbers. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and can be omitted without affecting the correctness of the function. 

The function should only check if the difference between every consecutive pair of integers in the list is exactly 1. The current implementation, however, incorrectly returns `False` for lists with a single element or an empty list, as mentioned in the output hints. These edge cases should be handled appropriately. For instance, an empty list or a list with a single element should return `False` because they do not contain multiple consecutive numbers. 

Thus, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate based on the problem description and the provided output hints. The program needs to be revised to correctly handle edge cases and simplify the logic.
