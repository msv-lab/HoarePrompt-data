Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given list contains consecutive numbers. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting the List**: 
   - The first line of the function sorts the list `lst` using `lst.sort()`. Sorting the list ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**:
   - The expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` iterates through the sorted list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is exactly 1. This ensures that all numbers in the list are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Unique Elements**:
   - The expression `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements in the list. This condition is necessary because in a list of consecutive numbers, each number should appear exactly once.

4. **Combining Conditions**:
   - The function uses the logical AND operator (`and`) to combine these two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the function to return `True`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element. For an empty list, the condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` will fail, and for a list with a single element, the list cannot contain multiple unique elements, so the condition will also fail.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` always meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
