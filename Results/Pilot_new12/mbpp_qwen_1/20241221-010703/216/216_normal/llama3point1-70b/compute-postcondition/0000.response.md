The `sort()` method is called on the list `lst`, which sorts the list in ascending order. The original values of the elements in `lst` are replaced with their sorted values. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers in ascending order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers in ascending order**
