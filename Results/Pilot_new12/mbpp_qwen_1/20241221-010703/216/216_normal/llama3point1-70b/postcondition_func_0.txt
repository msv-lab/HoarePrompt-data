The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers. After sorting the list, it checks whether the difference between every consecutive pair of integers in the list is exactly 1 and whether the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements in the list. If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with a single element, where the function would return `False` since the length of the list cannot equal the number of unique elements under these conditions.
