The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as a parameter and returns `True` if the list is non-empty and all its elements are consecutive integers in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that for the function to return `True`, the list must be sorted in ascending order and each element must differ from the previous one by exactly 1. If the list is empty or any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`.
