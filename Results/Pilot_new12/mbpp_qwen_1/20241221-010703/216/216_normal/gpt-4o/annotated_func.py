#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, and for every pair of consecutive elements in `lst_sorted`, the difference between them is exactly 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as a parameter and returns `True` if the list is non-empty and all its elements are consecutive integers in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that for the function to return `True`, the list must be sorted in ascending order and each element must differ from the previous one by exactly 1. If the list is empty or any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`.
