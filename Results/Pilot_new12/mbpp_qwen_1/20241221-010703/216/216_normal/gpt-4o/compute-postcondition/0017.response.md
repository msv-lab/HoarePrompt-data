Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as a parameter and returns `True` if the list is non-empty and all its elements are consecutive integers in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that for the function to return `True`, the list must be sorted in ascending order and each element must differ from the previous one by exactly 1. If the list is empty or any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty (`[]`), the function returns `False`.
- If the list contains non-consecutive integers, the function returns `False`.

**Summary of Actions:**
- Checks if the list is empty. If it is, returns `False`.
- Sorts the list in ascending order.
- Iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1.
- Returns `True` only if the list is non-empty and all elements are consecutive integers. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
