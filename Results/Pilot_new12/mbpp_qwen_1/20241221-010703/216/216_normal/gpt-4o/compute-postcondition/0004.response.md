State before the loop starts: `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The for loop `for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):` will execute as long as `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means that `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial Values**: 
   - `lst_sorted` is already given as a sorted version of `lst`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `range(len(lst_sorted) - 1)`, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2 (because we subtract 1 from the length and the loop starts from 0).
   - Therefore, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order).
- `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
- `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be initialized to 0.

Final Answer:
State: **`lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
