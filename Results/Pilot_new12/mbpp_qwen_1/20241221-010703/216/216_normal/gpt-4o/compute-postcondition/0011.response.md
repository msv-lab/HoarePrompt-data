According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is an integer where initially it is 1.
- `lst_sorted` is a list with at least two elements.
- If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's determine the new state:

1. Initially, `i` is 1.
2. After the loop, if `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
3. The list `lst_sorted` must still have at least two elements to ensure the condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` holds true.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `lst_sorted` must still have at least two elements.

State: **`i` is 2, and `lst_sorted` is a list with at least two elements**
