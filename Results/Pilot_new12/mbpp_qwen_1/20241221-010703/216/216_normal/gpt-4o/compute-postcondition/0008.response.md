Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order).
   - `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
   - `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(len(lst_sorted) - 1)`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the current condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The new condition to check is `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, incrementing `i` to 1.
   - `len(lst_sorted)` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` must still be 1.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `len(lst_sorted)` must still be at least 2.
   - The difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` must still be 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is 1**.
