The `sorted(lst)` function sorts the list `lst` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to `lst_sorted`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), and `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.

Output State: **`lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.**
