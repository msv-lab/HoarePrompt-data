Output State: **`lst_sorted` is a sorted version of the original list `lst` (in ascending order), `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, and for every pair of consecutive elements in `lst_sorted`, the difference between them is exactly 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the sorted list `lst_sorted` and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1.
- If the loop completes without finding any pair of consecutive elements whose difference is not 1, the function does not return False, implying that the condition holds for all pairs of consecutive elements.
- If the loop finds a pair of consecutive elements whose difference is not 1, the function returns False immediately.
- Since the loop only checks consecutive elements and the list is sorted, if the loop completes without returning, it means all consecutive elements satisfy the condition of having a difference of 1.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, we can conclude that the difference between every pair of consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is exactly 1.
