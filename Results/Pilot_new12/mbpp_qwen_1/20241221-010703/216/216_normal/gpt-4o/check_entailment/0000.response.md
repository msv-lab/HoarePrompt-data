Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through the sorted list to check if each element is exactly one more than the previous element. If any pair of consecutive elements does not satisfy this condition, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A list with consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`.
- A list with a gap between consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`.
- A list with duplicate numbers but not consecutive `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`.

These test cases cover typical scenarios. Additionally, the function handles the case of an empty list correctly by returning `False`. Since the function behaves as expected in the provided examples and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the function is correct.
