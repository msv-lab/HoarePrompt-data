Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and checks if each element differs from the next by exactly 1. The code handles all the described scenarios correctly:

- For an empty list, it returns `False`.
- For a list with consecutive numbers in ascending order, it returns `True`.
- For a list with non-consecutive numbers, it returns `False`.

The code logic aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases. There are no apparent edge cases or examples that the code does not handle correctly within the constraints of the problem description.
