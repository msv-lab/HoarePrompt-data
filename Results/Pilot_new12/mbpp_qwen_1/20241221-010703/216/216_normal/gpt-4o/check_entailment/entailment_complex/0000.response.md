Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function first checks if the list is empty (`if (not lst)`). If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`. This handles the case where the input list might be empty.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list using `lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`. Sorting ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutiveness.

3. **Consecutive Check**: After sorting, the function iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 (`if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1`). If any pair of consecutive elements does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`.

4. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any pairs of elements with a difference other than 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The provided test cases also validate the behavior of the function:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the list is sorted and all elements are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the element 5 and 6 are not consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the list is not in ascending order (1, 2, 1).

Given that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
