Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotated version supports this by clearly indicating the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the function's logic. The function handles an empty list by returning `False`, and it correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers and those with gaps. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
