Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers by first ensuring the list is not empty. It then sorts the list and checks if each element differs from the previous one by exactly 1. This approach correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers in ascending order. Given the problem description and the examples provided in the output hints, the code handles all potential cases correctly.
