Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, requiring the list to be non-empty and for each element to differ from the previous one by exactly 1 when the list is sorted in ascending order. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including consecutive numbers, missing consecutive numbers, and repeated numbers, and the function behaves as expected in all cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
