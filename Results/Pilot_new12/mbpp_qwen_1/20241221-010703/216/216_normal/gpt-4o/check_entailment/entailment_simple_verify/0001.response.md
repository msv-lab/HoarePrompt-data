Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotations support the correctness of the program by describing the state of the program at different points:

1. Before the function call, `lst` is a list of integers.
2. Inside the function, the program first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is.
3. After sorting the list, the program iterates through it to ensure that each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. If any pair of consecutive elements does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
