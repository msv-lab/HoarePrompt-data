Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotations provided clarify that the function first checks if the list is empty, then sorts the list, and finally verifies if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. Since the program logic is sound and the test cases validate the function for the given problem description, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains accurate.
