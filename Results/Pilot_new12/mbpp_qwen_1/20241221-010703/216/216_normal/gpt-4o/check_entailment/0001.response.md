Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. The test cases provided cover different scenarios:

1. A list with consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`.
2. A list with missing consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`.
3. A list with repeated numbers `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`.

These test cases are sufficient to validate the function for the given problem description. Additionally, the function logic is sound and handles the requirement correctly for any input list. Therefore, the program is correct.
