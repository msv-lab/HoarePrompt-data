Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers by first checking if the list is empty and then sorting the list to ensure it is in ascending order. The function then iterates through the sorted list to verify that each element is exactly one more than the previous element. If any element does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The annotated version clearly supports the correctness of the function, as it describes the state of the program at various points and aligns with the expected behavior of the function. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as intended for different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the final assessment remains **True**.
