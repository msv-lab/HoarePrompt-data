Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by ensuring the list is non-empty and each element differs from the previous one by exactly 1 after sorting. The provided output hints confirm that the function returns `True` only if the list is non-empty and all elements are consecutive integers in ascending order. The function handles the case of an empty list by returning `False`. The test cases given also validate the function's behavior across different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is correct.
