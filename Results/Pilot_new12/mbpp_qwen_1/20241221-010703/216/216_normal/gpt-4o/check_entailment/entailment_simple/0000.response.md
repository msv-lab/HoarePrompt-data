Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function first checks if the list is empty using `if (not lst):`. If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting and Comparison**: The function sorts the list using `lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`. It then iterates through the sorted list and checks if each consecutive pair of elements has a difference of exactly 1. If any pair of consecutive elements does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.

3. **Return True**: If the function completes the iteration without finding any non-consecutive pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that all numbers in the list are consecutive.

The provided test cases also validate different scenarios:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `True` because all numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` should return `False` because there is a gap between 3 and 5.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` should return `False` because the numbers are not in increasing order and hence not consecutive.

Since the function logic aligns with the problem description and the test cases cover various edge cases, the program is correct.
