The code `frequency[digit] = 1` sets the value of the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency` to 1. Since `digit` is a key in the dictionary, its corresponding value is set to 1. The initial state is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), and `frequency` is a dictionary. After executing the code, the value of `frequency[digit]` is set to 1, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), `frequency` is a dictionary with `digit` as a key and its value set to 1.**
