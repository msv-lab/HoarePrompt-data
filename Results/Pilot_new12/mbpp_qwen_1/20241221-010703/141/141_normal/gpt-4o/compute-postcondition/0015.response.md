Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), and `frequency` is a dictionary where the key `digit` exists and its value is incremented by 1 if it was already present, otherwise a new entry is added with `digit` as the key and its value set to 1.***
