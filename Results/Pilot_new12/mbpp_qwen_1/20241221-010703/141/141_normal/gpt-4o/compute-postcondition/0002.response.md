According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must contain at least one character because the loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer. This information is not directly relevant to the loop condition since the loop depends on `digit_str`.
2. The variable `frequency` is an empty dictionary. This information is also not directly relevant to the loop condition.

The key point is that `digit_str` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `digit_str` is a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is an empty dictionary {}**
