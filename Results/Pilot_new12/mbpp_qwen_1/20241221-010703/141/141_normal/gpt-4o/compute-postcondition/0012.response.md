Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str` is a non-empty string.
   - `frequency` is a dictionary where, if a digit from `digit_str` is already a key in `frequency`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1. If it is not a key, a new entry is added with the digit as the key and its value set to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`. Since `digit_str` is a string, each iteration processes one character, which is treated as a digit.

3. **Effect of One Iteration**: After processing one character (digit) in `digit_str`, the loop updates the `frequency` dictionary accordingly.

4. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `digit_str` needs to be processed. Therefore, the state should reflect that one character has been processed.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer because the number of digits does not affect `n`.
   - `digit_str` is now one character shorter than before because one character has been processed.
   - `frequency` remains the same as it was updated based on the current character but will be updated again in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string (one character shorter), and `frequency` is a dictionary. If `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1. If `digit` is not a key in `frequency`, a new entry is added with `digit` as the key and its value set to 1.**
