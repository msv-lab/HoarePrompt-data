Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary. If `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1. If `digit` is not a key in `frequency`, a new entry is added with `digit` as the key and its value set to 1.***
