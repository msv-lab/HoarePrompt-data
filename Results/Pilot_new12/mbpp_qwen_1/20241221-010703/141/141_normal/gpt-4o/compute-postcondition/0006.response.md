The code assigns the value `1` to `frequency[digit]`. Since `digit` is not already in `frequency`, this adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary where the key is `digit` and the value is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{digit: 1}`, and `digit` is not in `frequency`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{digit: 1}`, and `digit` is not in `frequency`.**
