Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it into a string `digit_str` containing all its digits. It then creates a frequency dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each digit. After counting the digits, it checks if the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself. If such a case is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would still result in an empty string `digit_str`), and when `n` is a single-digit number (where `frequency` would contain only one entry).**

**The final state of the program after it concludes is as follows:**
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `digit_str` is a string containing all the digits of `n`.
- `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`.

The function returns `True` only if the frequency of every digit in `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. In all other cases, it returns `False`.
