The code increments the count of the `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary. Since `digit` is a key in the `frequency` dictionary, the current value of `frequency[digit]` is some non-negative integer (let's denote it as `current_value`). After executing `frequency[digit] += 1`, the new value of `frequency[digit]` will be `current_value + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary, and `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.**
