Postcondition: ***`frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string containing all the digits of `n`, and `count` is an integer. If `count` is greater than the integer value of any digit in `digit_str`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (implying the same state as the precondition).***
