Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string containing all the digits of `n`, and `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is a non-negative integer**: This remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`digit_str` is a string containing all the digits of `n`**: As the loop iterates through each digit in `digit_str`, it processes every digit exactly once. Therefore, after all iterations, `digit_str` will still represent all the digits of `n`.
- **`frequency` is a dictionary**:
  - Initially, `frequency` is an empty dictionary.
  - For each digit `digit` in `digit_str`, if `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1.
  - If `digit` is not a key in `frequency`, a new entry is added with `digit` as the key and its value set to 1.

By the end of the loop, `frequency` will contain each unique digit from `digit_str` as a key, with the value being the count of occurrences of that digit in `digit_str`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string containing all the digits of `n`, and `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`.
