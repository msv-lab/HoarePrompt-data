According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `digit_str` to process.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `digit_str` is a non-empty string.
- `frequency` is a dictionary where if a digit `digit` is already in `frequency`, `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must still contain characters. Therefore, `digit_str` must not be empty.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `digit_str` was non-empty.
2. For the loop to continue, `digit_str` must still have characters left to process.
3. Thus, `digit_str` must not be empty.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary.**
