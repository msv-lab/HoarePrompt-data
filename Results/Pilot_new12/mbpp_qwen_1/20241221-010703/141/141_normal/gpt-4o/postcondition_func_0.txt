The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it into a string `digit_str` containing all its digits. It then creates a frequency dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each digit. After counting the digits, it checks if the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself. If such a case is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which would still result in an empty string `digit_str`), and when `n` is a single-digit number (where `frequency` would contain only one entry).
