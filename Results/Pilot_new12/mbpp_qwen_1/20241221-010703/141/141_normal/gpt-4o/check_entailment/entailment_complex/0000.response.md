Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conversion to String**: The integer `n` is converted to a string `digit_str` to facilitate the counting of each digit. This step is necessary to process individual digits.

3. **Frequency Counting**: A dictionary `frequency` is used to count the occurrences of each digit in `digit_str`. The logic inside the first for-loop correctly updates the counts in the `frequency` dictionary.

4. **Validation**: After computing the frequencies, the second for-loop iterates over the items in the `frequency` dictionary. For each key-value pair `(digit, count)` in the dictionary, it checks if `count` is greater than the numeric value of `digit`. If such a condition is found, the function immediately returns `False`.

5. **Return Value**: If no digit has a frequency greater than its numeric value, the function returns `True`. This ensures that the function adheres to the requirement specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately:
   - When `n` is `0`, the string `digit_str` will be `"0"`, and the frequency dictionary will contain one entry with key `"0"` and value `1`. Since `1 <= 0` is false, the function correctly returns `False`.
   - When `n` is a single-digit number (e.g., `123`), the frequency dictionary will contain three entries, each with a value `1`, which is less than or equal to the digit itself, leading to `True`.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs.
