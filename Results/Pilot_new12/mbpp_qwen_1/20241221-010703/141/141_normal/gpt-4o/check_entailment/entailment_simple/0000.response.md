Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n`. The problem description does not explicitly state that the input should be validated for being a non-negative integer, so this part is within the assumptions made in the problem statement.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The integer `n` is converted to a string `digit_str` to easily iterate over each digit.
   - A dictionary `frequency` is used to count the occurrence of each digit in `digit_str`.

3. **Validation Logic**:
   - For each digit in `frequency`, the program checks if the count of the digit is greater than the digit itself (`count > int(digit)`).
   - If any digit's count exceeds the digit itself, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If no such digit is found, the function returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
     - `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because all digit frequencies (1, 1; 2, 1; 3, 1; 4, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.
     - `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit '5' appears once, which is greater than the digit '5'.
     - `func_1(321)` returns `True` because all digit frequencies (3, 1; 2, 1; 1, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.

Given these points, the program correctly checks the condition specified in the problem description for any valid integer input. Therefore, the program is correct.
