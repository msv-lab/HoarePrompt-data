Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. The code handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers and the number 0. For instance, `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to the digit itself. Similarly, `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the frequency of the digit '5' is 1, which is not less than or equal to 5. The code works for all tested examples and does not require additional handling for invalid inputs as per the problem description.
