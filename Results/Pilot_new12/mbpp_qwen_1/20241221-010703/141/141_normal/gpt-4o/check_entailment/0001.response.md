Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit value. Based on the assertions provided:

- `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because all digits' frequencies (1, 1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit '5' has a frequency of 1, which is not less than or equal to 5, but another instance exists making the frequency more than 1.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True` because all digits' frequencies (1, 1, 1) are less than or equal to the digits themselves.

The function handles the provided examples correctly and seems to cover the logic required by the problem description without any missing edge cases or logical errors.
