Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit value. Given the test cases:

- `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to the digit itself.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit '5' appears only once, but its frequency is 1, which is not less than or equal to 5.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (3, 2, 1) is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The function handles all these cases correctly, and upon further analysis, no other edge cases were found that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.
