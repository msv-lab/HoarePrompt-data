#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is an empty string, and the function returns None.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It converts `n` to a string and iterates through each digit. For each digit, it checks if the count of the digit in the string representation of `n` is greater than the value of the digit itself. If this condition is met for any digit, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after checking all digits, the function returns `True`. The function will return `False` in three cases (which are not specified explicitly in the code but can be inferred from the annotations), and it will return `True` in one case where none of the digits meet the condition described above. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 or a single-digit number.
