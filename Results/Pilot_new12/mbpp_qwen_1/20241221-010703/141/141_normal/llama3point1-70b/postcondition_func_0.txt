The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It converts `n` to a string and iterates through each digit. For each digit, it checks if the count of the digit in the string representation of `n` is greater than the value of the digit itself. If this condition is met for any digit, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after checking all digits, the function returns `True`. The function will return `False` in three cases (which are not specified explicitly in the code but can be inferred from the annotations), and it will return `True` in one case where none of the digits meet the condition described above. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 or a single-digit number.
