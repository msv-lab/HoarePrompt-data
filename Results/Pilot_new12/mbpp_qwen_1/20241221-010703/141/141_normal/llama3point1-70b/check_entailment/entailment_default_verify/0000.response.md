Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the program's functionality. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The output hints confirm that the function processes each digit correctly and returns `False` if any digit's frequency exceeds its value. Given the test cases and the logical structure of the function, there is no indication that the program fails to meet the problem description or the output hints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
