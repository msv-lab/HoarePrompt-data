Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with some test cases:

1. For `n = 12234`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1: 1 (<= 1)
   - 2: 2 (<= 2)
   - 3: 1 (<= 3)
   - 4: 1 (<= 4)

2. For `n = 3211000`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 0: 3 (<= 3)
   - 1: 2 (<= 1)
   - 2: 1 (<= 2)
   - 3: 1 (<= 3)

3. For `n = 9876543210`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 0: 1 (<= 0)
   - 1: 1 (<= 1)
   - 2: 1 (<= 2)
   - 3: 1 (<= 3)
   - 4: 1 (<= 4)
   - 5: 1 (<= 5)
   - 6: 1 (<= 6)
   - 7: 1 (<= 7)
   - 8: 1 (<= 8)
   - 9: 1 (<= 9)

In all these cases, the function returns the correct result. Since there are no counterexamples where the function fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
