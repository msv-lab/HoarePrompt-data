Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The code converts the integer to a string and iterates through each digit, counting its occurrences using `str_n.count(digit)` and comparing it to the digit's value converted to an integer. If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`. If no such digit is found, it returns `True`.

The potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints, such as when `n` is 0 or a single-digit number, are correctly handled by the code. For instance, if `n` is 0, the function will return `True` because there are no digits to compare. Similarly, for single-digit numbers, the function will also return `True` since the frequency of the digit itself is exactly equal to the digit.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
