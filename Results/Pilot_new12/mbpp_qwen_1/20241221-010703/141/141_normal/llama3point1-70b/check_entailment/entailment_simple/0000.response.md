Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires checking whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the current implementation checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit, which is not the same as the required condition.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

- The current code checks if `str_n.count(digit) > int(digit)`. This means it checks if the count of the digit in the number is greater than the digit itself.
- The problem statement requires that the frequency of each digit should be less than or equal to the digit itself. Therefore, the correct condition should be `str_n.count(digit) <= int(digit)`.

To fix this, the `if` statement should be updated to use the correct condition:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in set(str_n):  # Using set to avoid counting the same digit multiple times
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

With this correction, the program will accurately check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself, thereby meeting the problem description.
