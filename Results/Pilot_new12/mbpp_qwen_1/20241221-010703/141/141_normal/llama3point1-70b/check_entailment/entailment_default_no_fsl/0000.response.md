Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when the input integer `n` contains repeated digits. Specifically, the code checks if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is greater than the digit itself, but it does not account for the possibility that the same digit might appear multiple times. 

For example, consider the input `n = 33`. The code would correctly identify that the count of '3' is 2, which is equal to the digit itself, and thus should return `True`. However, the code should also correctly handle cases where the count of a digit exceeds the digit itself, such as `n = 34`, where the count of '3' is 1 and the digit itself is 3, so it should return `False`.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the count of each digit does not exceed the digit itself. The current implementation does not fail in the described problem statement for the specific examples given, but it does not cover all potential edge cases, leading to an incorrect verdict.
