Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with a few examples:

1. For `n = 332`, the digit '3' appears twice (frequency = 2), which is less than or equal to the digit itself (3). The digit '2' appears once (frequency = 1), which is also less than or equal to the digit itself (2). The function returns `True`.
2. For `n = 9876543210`, each digit's frequency is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function returns `True`.
3. For `n = 111`, the digit '1' appears three times (frequency = 3), which is equal to the digit itself (1). The function returns `True`.

In each of these cases, the function behaves as expected. Since no counterexample was found where the function does not meet the requirements, the program is correct.
