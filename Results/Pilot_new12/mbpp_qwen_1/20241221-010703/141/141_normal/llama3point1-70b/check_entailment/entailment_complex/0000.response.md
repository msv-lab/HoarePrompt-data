Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `n` is a single-digit number or zero. Here's why:

1. **Single-Digit Numbers**: When `n` is a single-digit number, the function should return `True` because the frequency of the digit itself (which is 1) is indeed less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the current implementation does not handle this case. For example, if `n = 5`, the function should return `True` because the digit '5' appears exactly once, which is less than or equal to 5.

2. **Zero**: When `n` is zero, the function should also return `True` because the digit '0' appears exactly once, which is less than or equal to 0. However, the current implementation does not handle this case either.

To fix these issues, the function should explicitly handle these edge cases. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    
    # Handle edge cases for single-digit numbers and zero
    if len(str_n) == 1 and int(str_n) == 0:
        return True
    
    return True
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle all cases as per the problem description.
