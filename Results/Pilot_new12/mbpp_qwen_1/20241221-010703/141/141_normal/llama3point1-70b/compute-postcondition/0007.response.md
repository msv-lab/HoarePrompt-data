Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n` (one character less). If the count of the digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the digit, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific action is taken and the postcondition remains as the preconditions state.***
