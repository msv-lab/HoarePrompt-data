Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is an empty string, and the function returns None.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `str_n` is a string representation of `n`.
2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `str_n`.
   - For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of that digit.
   - If the condition `str_n.count(digit) > int(digit)` is true for any digit, the function returns `False`.

3. **Output State After Loop Executes**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: The loop checks the first digit. If the count of that digit is greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`.
   - **After 2 iterations**: The loop checks the first two digits. If the count of any of these digits is greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`.
   - **After 3 iterations**: The loop checks the first three digits. If the count of any of these digits is greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`.

4. **Final Iteration**:
   - When the loop finishes executing, it means that for every digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit is not greater than its integer value.
   - This implies that `str_n` must become an empty string for the loop to finish without returning `False`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the loop continues until `str_n` becomes empty and the function does not return `False` during this process, the only possible outcome is that `str_n` is an empty string when the loop exits.
   - Therefore, the final output state is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is an empty string, and the function returns `None`.
