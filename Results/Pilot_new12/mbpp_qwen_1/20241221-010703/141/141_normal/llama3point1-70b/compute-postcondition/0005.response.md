Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n`.
   - The count of digits in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for digit in str_n:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `str_n`.
   - Each iteration assigns the current character to the variable `digit`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` holds the last character processed from `str_n`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each digit in `str_n`, we know that there are still more characters left in `str_n` that haven't been processed.

5. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `str_n` remains the same string but with one less character to be processed.
   - The number of digits left to process is now one less than before.

6. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `str_n` must be a non-empty string (one character less than before).
   - The count of digits in the remaining part of `str_n` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit` to be processed.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n` (one character less), and the count of digits in the remaining part of `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit` to be processed.**

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n` (one character less), and the count of digits in the remaining part of `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit` to be processed**
