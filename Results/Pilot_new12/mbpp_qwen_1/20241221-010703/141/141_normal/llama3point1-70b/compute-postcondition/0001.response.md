State before the loop starts: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is a string representation of `n`.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop iterates over each character in `str_n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must be a non-empty string because if `str_n` is an empty string, there will be no characters to iterate over.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `str_n` is a non-empty string. Since `str_n` is a string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` should be a string that represents at least one digit (0 through 9).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n`**
