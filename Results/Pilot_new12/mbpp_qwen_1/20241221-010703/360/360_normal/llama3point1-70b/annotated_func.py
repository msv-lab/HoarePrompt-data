#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the list from `lists` that has the highest sum of its integer elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the list from `lists` that has the highest sum of its integer elements. If multiple lists have the same highest sum, it returns one of them. An edge case to consider is when `lists` is empty; in such a scenario, the function should raise a `ValueError` since there are no lists to compare. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where one of the inner lists is empty, although this is less critical as the sum of an empty list would be zero.
