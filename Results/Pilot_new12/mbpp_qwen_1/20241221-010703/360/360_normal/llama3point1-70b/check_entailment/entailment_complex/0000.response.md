Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of integers as input and returns the list with the highest sum of its integer elements. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Input**: The function correctly accepts a parameter `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists of integers.
2. **Function Output**: The function uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument to find the list with the maximum sum. This ensures that the list with the highest sum of its elements is returned.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: While the program does not explicitly handle the case where `lists` is empty, it will raise a `TypeError` because `max()` cannot operate on an empty iterable. This behavior aligns with the assumption that the input will be valid, meaning the function does not need to handle an empty list scenario separately under this assumption.
4. **No Need for Special Handling of Empty Inner Lists**: As mentioned in the comments, the function does not need to handle the case where one of the inner lists is empty because the sum of an empty list is zero, which does not affect the overall comparison.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles the given requirements appropriately, the correctness is True.
