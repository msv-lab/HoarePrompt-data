Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when the input list `lists` is empty. According to the problem description, if `lists` is empty, the function should raise a `ValueError`. However, the current implementation simply returns `max(lists, key=sum)`, which would raise a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError` when `lists` is empty. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
