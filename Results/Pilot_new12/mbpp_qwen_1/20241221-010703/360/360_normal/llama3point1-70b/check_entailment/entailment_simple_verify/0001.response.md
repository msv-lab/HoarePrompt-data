Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly returns the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The `max` function with `key=sum` is used appropriately to find the list with the maximum sum. The annotations confirm that the input is a list of lists of integers, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct under the given assumptions.
