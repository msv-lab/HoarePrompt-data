Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and returns the list within that list whose sum of elements is the highest. This is achieved using the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument, which correctly identifies the list with the maximum sum of its elements. Given the problem description, this implementation is correct because:

- It processes a list of lists (as specified).
- It returns the list with the highest sum of elements.
- It handles all possible valid inputs as per the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors.

Therefore, the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
