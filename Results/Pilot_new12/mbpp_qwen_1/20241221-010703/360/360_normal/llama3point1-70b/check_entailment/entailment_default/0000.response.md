Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when the input list `lists` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should raise a `ValueError` in such a scenario. The current implementation simply returns the list with the highest sum, which is undefined behavior for an empty input list. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
