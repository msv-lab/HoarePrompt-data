Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. It uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument, which compares the sums of the lists and returns the one with the highest sum. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty sublists or sublists with negative numbers. There is no scenario provided or conceivable where this function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.
