Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is not entirely accurate. While the function `func_1` does indeed return the list with the highest sum of its integer elements, it fails to account for two critical edge cases:
1. **Empty Input List**: When `lists` is an empty list, the function does not raise a `ValueError`. Instead, it returns `None` because there are no lists to compare, leading to an undefined behavior. An appropriate response in this scenario would be to raise a `ValueError`.
2. **Empty Inner Lists**: Although not explicitly stated in the problem description, the function does not handle the case where one of the inner lists is empty. The sum of an empty list is zero, and the function may return such a list if it has the highest sum among other lists with lower sums. However, it is generally expected that the function should return the first list that has the highest sum, not necessarily the last one.

Given these considerations, the program does not fully meet the problem description without handling these edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
