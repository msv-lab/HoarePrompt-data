Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both support the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument, which correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotation clarifies that `lists` is a list of lists of integers, ensuring that the `sum` function can be applied to each sublist without issues. Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the function behaves as expected and meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
