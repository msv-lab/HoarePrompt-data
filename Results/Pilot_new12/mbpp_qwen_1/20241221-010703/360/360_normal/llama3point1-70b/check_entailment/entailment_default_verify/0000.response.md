Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. However, the output hints reveal a critical issue: the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In such a scenario, the function should raise a `ValueError` because there are no lists to compare. Since the original assessment did not mention this edge case, it appears to overlook an important aspect of the problem description. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description and the output hints.
