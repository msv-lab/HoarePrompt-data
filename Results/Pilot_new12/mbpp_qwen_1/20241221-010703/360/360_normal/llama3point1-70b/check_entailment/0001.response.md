Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The `max` function with `key=sum` ensures that the list with the maximum sum is returned. This approach works for all potential cases as long as the input is a non-empty list of lists containing numerical values. Since no specific edge cases or invalid inputs were mentioned, and the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
