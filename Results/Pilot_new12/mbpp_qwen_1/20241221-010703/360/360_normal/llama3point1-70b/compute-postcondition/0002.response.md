Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the list from `lists` that has the highest sum of its integer elements. If multiple lists have the same highest sum, it returns one of them. An edge case to consider is when `lists` is empty; in such a scenario, the function should raise a `ValueError` since there are no lists to compare. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where one of the inner lists is empty, although this is less critical as the sum of an empty list would be zero.**

**Final state of the program after it concludes:** The program will return a list (or one of the lists) from the input `lists` that has the highest sum of its integer elements. If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
