#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist in `list_of_lists` with the maximum sum.
    return max_list
    #The program returns `max_list`, which is the sublist in `list_of_lists` with the maximum sum
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` to calculate the sum of each sublist. It keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum (`max_list`) and its corresponding sum (`max_sum`). After evaluating all sublists, the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum. Potential edge cases include an empty `list_of_lists` (in which case the function would return an empty list) and sublists containing no elements (which would also result in an empty list being returned).
