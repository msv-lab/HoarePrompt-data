Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The annotated version supports this by clearly indicating the state of the program at different stages and confirming that the function logic is sound. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity, ensuring that any sum encountered during iteration will be higher, and updates `max_list` only when a higher sum is found. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function handles them correctly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is valid.
