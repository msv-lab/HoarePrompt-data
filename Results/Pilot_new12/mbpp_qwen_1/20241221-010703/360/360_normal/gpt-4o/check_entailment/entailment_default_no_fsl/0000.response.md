Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The code handles all the provided test cases and potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints. Specifically:

1. It correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum from non-empty lists.
2. It returns an empty list if the input `list_of_lists` is empty.
3. It handles sublists that contain no elements, which would result in a sum of zero and thus still an empty list.

Since the code works for all provided examples and potential edge cases, the program is correct.
