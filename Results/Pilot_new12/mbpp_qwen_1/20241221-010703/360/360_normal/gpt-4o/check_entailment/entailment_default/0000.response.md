Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct based on the problem description and the given assertions. The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. Finally, it returns the sublist with the maximum sum. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple sublists, single-element sublists, and sublists with different sums. The code handles these cases correctly, and there are no potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints.
