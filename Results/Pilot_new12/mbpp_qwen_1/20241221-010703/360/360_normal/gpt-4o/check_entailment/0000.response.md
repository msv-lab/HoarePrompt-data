Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum encountered so far. Given the examples and the logic implemented, the function works as expected for all potential cases.
