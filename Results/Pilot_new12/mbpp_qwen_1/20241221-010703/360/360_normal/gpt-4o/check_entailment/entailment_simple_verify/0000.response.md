Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the provided annotated version and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure any sublist sum will be greater initially. It iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly. After the loop, it returns `max_list`, which contains the sublist with the maximum sum. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, and the provided test cases validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
