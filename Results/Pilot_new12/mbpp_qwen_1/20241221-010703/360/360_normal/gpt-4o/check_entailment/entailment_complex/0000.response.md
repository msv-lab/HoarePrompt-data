Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to find and return the sublist within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements.
2. **Initialization**:
   - `max_sum` is initialized to `-inf` to ensure any list's sum will be larger.
   - `max_list` is initialized to an empty list to handle edge cases where there might be no suitable sublist found.
3. **Iterating Through Sublists**:
   - For each sublist in `list_of_lists`, the program calculates the sum of its elements using `sum(sublist)`.
   - If the calculated sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `max_list` are updated accordingly.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, the initial values of `max_sum` and `max_list` will be used, resulting in `max_list` being returned as an empty list.
   - Sublists with no elements will have a sum of `0`, which is not considered as they would be less than `-inf` initially, ensuring no incorrect handling.

Given the provided assertions, the function works correctly in all tested scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
