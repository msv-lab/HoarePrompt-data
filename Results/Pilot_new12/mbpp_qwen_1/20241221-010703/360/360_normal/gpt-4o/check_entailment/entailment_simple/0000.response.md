Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find and return the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements.
2. **Logic**: The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` as an empty list. It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the elements in the current sublist, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` if the current sum is greater than `max_sum`. After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`.
3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with different inputs and expected outputs, confirming that the function works correctly for those cases.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic to find the sublist with the highest sum, and the provided test cases validate its correctness for the specified scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
