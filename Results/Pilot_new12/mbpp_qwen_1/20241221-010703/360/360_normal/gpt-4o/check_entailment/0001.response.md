Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and iterates through each sublist, calculating its sum. If the current sublist's sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. This ensures that `max_list` will hold the sublist with the highest sum after iterating through all sublists.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. A list with multiple sublists of different sizes and values.
2. A list with sublists of similar values but different sums.
3. A list with a single sublist.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct for all potential cases within the given problem description.
