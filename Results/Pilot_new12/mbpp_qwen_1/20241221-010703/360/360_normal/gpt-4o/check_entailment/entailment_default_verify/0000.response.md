Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and return the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. The function handles edge cases such as an empty `list_of_lists` by returning an empty list. The provided test cases also support the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
