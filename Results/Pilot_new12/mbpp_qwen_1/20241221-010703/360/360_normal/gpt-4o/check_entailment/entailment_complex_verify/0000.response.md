Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is designed to find and return the sublist with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state transitions and logic within the function. 

- The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of each sublist, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly.
- After processing all sublists, the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

Given the provided assertions and the annotated version, the function behaves as intended and correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
