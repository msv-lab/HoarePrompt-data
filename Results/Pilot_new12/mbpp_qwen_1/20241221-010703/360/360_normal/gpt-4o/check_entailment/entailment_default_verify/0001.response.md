Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The logic of initializing `max_sum` to negative infinity and updating `max_list` and `max_sum` whenever a higher sum is found is sound. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including sublists of different sizes and values, ensuring the function behaves as expected. The output hints confirm that the function correctly iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
