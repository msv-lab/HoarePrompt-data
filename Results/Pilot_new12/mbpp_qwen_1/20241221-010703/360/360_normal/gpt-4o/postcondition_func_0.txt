The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` to calculate the sum of each sublist. It keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum (`max_list`) and its corresponding sum (`max_sum`). After evaluating all sublists, the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum. Potential edge cases include an empty `list_of_lists` (in which case the function would return an empty list) and sublists containing no elements (which would also result in an empty list being returned).
