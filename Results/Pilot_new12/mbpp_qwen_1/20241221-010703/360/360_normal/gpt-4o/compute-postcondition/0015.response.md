The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. This means `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, but no other changes occur to the variables. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 3, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the current sublist, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.**
