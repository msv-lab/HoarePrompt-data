`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of elements in `sublist`. The previous value of `current_sum` was the sum of elements in the previous sublist. The value of `index` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 2, and `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 2, and `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.**
