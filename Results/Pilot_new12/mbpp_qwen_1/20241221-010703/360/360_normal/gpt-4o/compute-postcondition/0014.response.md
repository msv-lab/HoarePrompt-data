The code `current_sum = sum(sublist)` calculates the sum of all elements in the current sublist and assigns it to `current_sum`. The previous value of `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the previous sublist. After executing this line, the new value of `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the current sublist.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 3, and `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the current sublist.**
