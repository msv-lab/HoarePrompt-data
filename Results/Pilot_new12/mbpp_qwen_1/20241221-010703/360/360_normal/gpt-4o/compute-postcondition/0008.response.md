According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sublist` from the `list_of_lists`. The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`.
- Since there is no else part, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged unless the if condition is met.
- The initial values of `sublist` as the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` as 0, and `current_sum` as the sum of elements in `sublist` are preserved.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The `sublist` variable will now refer to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
2. The `index` variable will increment by 1.
3. The `current_sum` will be recalculated as the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- The `sublist` will be the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
- The `index` will be incremented by 1.
- The `current_sum` will be recalculated as the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 1 (incremented from the initial 0), and `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.**
