The code assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. This does not change the value of `max_sum` or `current_sum`, nor does it affect `index` or `list_of_lists`. The only change is that `max_list` is now set to the current value of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 0, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
