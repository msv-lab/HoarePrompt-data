State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, index is 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **List of Lists (`list_of_lists`)**: The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **Initial Values**: 
   - `max_sum` is initialized to `float('-inf')`. This value ensures that any sum of sublists will be larger initially.
   - `max_list` is an empty list, which will store the sublist with the maximum sum.

3. **First Iteration**: During the first iteration of the loop, `sublist` should be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the loop variable `index` (which is implicitly used in `enumerate`) should be 0.

By adjusting the state as described, we ensure that the loop can proceed and begin its execution correctly.
