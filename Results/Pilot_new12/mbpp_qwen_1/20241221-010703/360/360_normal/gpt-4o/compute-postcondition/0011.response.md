`max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The previous values of `list_of_lists`, `sublist`, `index`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 2, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`; `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 2, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`; `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`**
