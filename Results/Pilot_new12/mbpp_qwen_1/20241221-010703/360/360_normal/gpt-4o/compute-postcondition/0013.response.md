Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers.
   - `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - `index` is 2.
   - `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop has just completed an iteration with the current `sublist`.
   - The `index` was incremented from 1 to 2, indicating that the loop is moving to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more sublists left to process in `list_of_lists`.
   - The `index` will be incremented again, so it will become 3.
   - The `sublist` will now be the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, `sublist` will be the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - `index` will be 3.
   - `current_sum` will be recalculated as the sum of the elements in the new `sublist`.
   - `max_sum` and `max_list` will either remain unchanged or be updated depending on the value of `current_sum`.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `list_of_lists` remains the same.
- `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
- `index` is 3.
- `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.

However, since we do not know the exact values of `max_sum` and `max_list` without seeing their values from previous iterations, we only update the states that are explicitly mentioned in the loop condition and the index.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 3, and `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the new `sublist`.**
