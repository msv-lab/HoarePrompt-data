Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 3, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the current sublist. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
