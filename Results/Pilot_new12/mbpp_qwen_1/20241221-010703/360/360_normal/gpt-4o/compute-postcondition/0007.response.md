Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`. Since there is no else part, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged unless the if condition is met. The initial values of `sublist` as the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` as 0, and `current_sum` as the sum of elements in `sublist` are preserved.***
