The code initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This does not affect the `list_of_lists` variable. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial state of `list_of_lists` being a list of lists of integers, and `max_sum` will be set to negative infinity.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is float('-inf')**
