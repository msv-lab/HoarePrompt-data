`max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, so `max_sum` now equals `current_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is updated to `sublist`, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 0, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
