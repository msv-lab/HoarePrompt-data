The code `max_list = sublist` assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. This does not change the values of `current_sum` or `max_sum`, nor does it affect `list_of_lists` or `index`. The state of `sublist` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `index` is 3, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in the current sublist, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is `sublist`**
