You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of `substring` in `string` if `substring` is found, otherwise -1. The value of `start` is not -1
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #`substring`, the non-empty string found in `string` at index `start`; `start`, the index of where `substring` begins in `string`; `end - 1`, the index right before the end of `substring` in `string`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. `string` is a string, and `substring` is a non-empty string. The function searches for `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the function returns `None`. If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple containing the `substring`, the index of where `substring` begins in `string` (inclusive), and the index right before the end of `substring` in `string` (exclusive).

Potential edge cases include:
- If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function correctly returns `None`.
- If `substring` is found, the function returns the correct indices, ensuring that the second index is right before the end of `substring`.

The function ensures that if `substring` is present in `string`, it provides the substring along with its starting and ending indices (excluding the end index). If `substring` is not found, it gracefully returns `None`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
