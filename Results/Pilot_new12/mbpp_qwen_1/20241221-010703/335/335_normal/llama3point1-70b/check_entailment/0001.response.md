Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and calculates the ending index accordingly. This approach handles all potential cases without any issues. Since there is no specific edge case mentioned in the problem description that the provided code fails to handle, the function appears to be correct.
