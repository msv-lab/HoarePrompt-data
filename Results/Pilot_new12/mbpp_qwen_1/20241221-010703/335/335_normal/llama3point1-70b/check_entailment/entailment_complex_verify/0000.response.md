Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substring within a string. The function uses the `find` method to locate the substring and returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and `None` otherwise. The annotations support this behavior, indicating that if the substring is not found, the function returns `None`, and if found, it returns the correct indices. The function handles all potential cases as described, including the scenario where the substring is not found, thus meeting the problem description.
