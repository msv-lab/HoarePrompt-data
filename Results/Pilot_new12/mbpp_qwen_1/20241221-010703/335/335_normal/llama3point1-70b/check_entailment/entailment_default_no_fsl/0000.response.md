Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `find` method to locate the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, it returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement. If the `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `substring`, the starting index (inclusive), and the index right before the end of the `substring` (exclusive). This behavior matches the output hints and the potential edge cases mentioned. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case described.
