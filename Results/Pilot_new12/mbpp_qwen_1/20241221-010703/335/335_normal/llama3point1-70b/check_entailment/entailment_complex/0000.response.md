Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Accepts Valid Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`, both of which are as specified in the problem description. The function checks if `substring` is found in `string` using `string.find(substring)`.

2. **Handling Non-Finding Case**: If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. This is correctly handled by checking if `start` is `-1` (which indicates that `substring` was not found) and returning `None` in that case.

3. **Handling Finding Case**: If `substring` is found in `string`, the function returns a tuple containing:
   - The found `substring`
   - The index of where `substring` begins in `string` (inclusive, which is stored in `start`)
   - The index right before the end of `substring` in `string` (exclusive, which is calculated as `end - 1`)

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases as described:
   - It correctly returns `None` if `substring` is not found.
   - It returns the correct indices when `substring` is found, ensuring the second index is right before the end of `substring`.

Since the program correctly implements the required behavior and handles all specified cases without deviation, it meets the problem description and hence is correct.
