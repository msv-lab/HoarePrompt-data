Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a string. It should return `None` if the substring is not found.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`.
   - It uses the `find` method to locate the starting index (`start`) of the substring within the string.
   - If the substring is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None` as required.
   - If the substring is found, the function calculates the ending index (`end`) and returns the substring along with its starting and ending indices.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`.
   - If the substring is found, the function returns the substring, its starting index, and the index just before the end of the substring (i.e., `end - 1`).

Since the program handles both cases (found substring and not found substring) as specified in the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is `Correctness: True`.
