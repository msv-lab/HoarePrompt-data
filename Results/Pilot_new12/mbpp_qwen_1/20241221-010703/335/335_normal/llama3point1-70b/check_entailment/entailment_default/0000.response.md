Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. If the substring is found, it returns a tuple containing the substring itself, the starting index (inclusive), and the ending index (exclusive).

Given the output hints, the function behaves as expected:
- If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it returns the correct indices.

Since the code handles all the mentioned edge cases and the problem description is followed correctly, the program is correct.
