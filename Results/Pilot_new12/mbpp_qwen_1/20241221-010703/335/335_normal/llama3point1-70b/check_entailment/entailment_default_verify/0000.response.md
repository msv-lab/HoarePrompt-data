Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the program. The function `func_1` meets the problem description by finding the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and `None` otherwise. The function handles all potential cases, including the scenario where the substring is not found. The output hints provided also accurately summarize the functionality of the function, confirming that it behaves as expected for both the presence and absence of the substring in the given string. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
