Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. According to the annotations, the function handles both cases where the substring is found or not found in the string. 

- If the substring is not found (`start == -1`), the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, the function calculates the correct starting and ending indices (with the ending index being exclusive) and returns them in a tuple.

The annotated version supports the correctness of the function by detailing the state of the program at various stages and confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
