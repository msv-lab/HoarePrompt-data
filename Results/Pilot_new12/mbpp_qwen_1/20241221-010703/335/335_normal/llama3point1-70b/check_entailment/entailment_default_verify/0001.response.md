Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and calculates the ending index correctly. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected in all given scenarios, including the handling of the case where the substring is not found. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
