Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. The function returns the substring along with its start and end positions if the substring is found, and `None` otherwise. The annotations support this behavior, indicating that:
- If the substring is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, the function calculates the correct end position as `end - 1` and returns the substring, start index, and end index.

Given that the function handles both cases as required by the problem description and the annotations confirm the expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
