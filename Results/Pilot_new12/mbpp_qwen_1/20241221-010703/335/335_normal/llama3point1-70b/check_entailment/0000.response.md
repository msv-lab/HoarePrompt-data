Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and `None` otherwise. The function uses the `find` method of the string to locate the substring, which is the correct approach. Since the function handles all potential cases as described, including the scenario where the substring is not found, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
