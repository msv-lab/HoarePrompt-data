The `find` method of the `string` class is called with `substring` as the argument. This method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. The variable `start` is assigned this value. 

Given that `substring` is a non-empty string, the output state will be:
- `start` is assigned the index of `substring` in `string` if `substring` is found in `string`.
- If `substring` is not found in `string`, `start` is -1.

Output State: **`string` is a string and `substring` is a non-empty string; `start` is the index of `substring` in `string` if `substring` is found, otherwise -1.**
