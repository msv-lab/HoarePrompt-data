The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. `string` is a string, and `substring` is a non-empty string. The function returns either `None` or a tuple containing `substring`, the index of where `substring` begins in `string` (inclusive), and the index right before the end of `substring` in `string` (exclusive).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `string` and a non-empty string `substring`, and return either `None` or a tuple with the substring, its starting index, and the index right before its end.
