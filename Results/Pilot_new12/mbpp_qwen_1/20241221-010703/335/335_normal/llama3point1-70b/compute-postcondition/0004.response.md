The variable `end` is assigned the value of `start + len(substring)`. Since `start` is not -1, `end` will be the value of `start` plus the length of `substring`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of `substring` in `string`, `end` is `start + len(substring)`**
