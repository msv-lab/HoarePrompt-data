Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `main_string`, which is a string, and `sub_string`, which is a non-empty string. It searches for `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, the function returns `sub_string`, the starting position (`start_pos`) of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and the ending position (`end_pos`) of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, the function returns `None`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `main_string` is an empty string, the function will still attempt to find `sub_string`, but since `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty, the search will always return `-1`, leading to a return value of `None`. Therefore, the function should handle this case explicitly by checking if `main_string` is empty before proceeding with the search.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code currently does not handle the case where `main_string` is an empty string. To cover this, we should add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` if `main_string` is empty.

**Summary of the Final State:**
- After the function concludes, the program will either return `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, or it will return `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos` if `sub_string` is found.
