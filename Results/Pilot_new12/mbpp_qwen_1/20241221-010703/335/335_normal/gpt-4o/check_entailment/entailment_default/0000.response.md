Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the `main_string` is an empty string. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if there is no match, which would include the case where the `main_string` is empty. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example, if `main_string` is an empty string, the function will still attempt to find the substring, which will not match and will return `None`, but it should explicitly return `None` at the beginning of the function to handle this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
