Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Finding Substrings**: The function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. It uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring, and if found, calculates the ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.

2. **Handling No Match**: If the substring is not found (`find` returns -1), the function correctly returns `None`.

3. **Assertions Satisfied**: The assertions provided in the comments are all satisfied:
   - `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` returns `('python', 0, 6)` — correct.
   - `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')` returns `('programming', 7, 18)` — correct.
   - `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language')` returns `('language', 31, 39)` — correct.
   - `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` returns `None` — correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling the case where `main_string` is empty, the function already handles this implicitly by returning `None` when `find` returns -1, which would occur if `main_string` is empty.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all provided test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `True`.
