Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including the presence of the substring, the absence of the substring, and the presence of multiple occurrences of the substring. The function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect the correct behavior of the function.
