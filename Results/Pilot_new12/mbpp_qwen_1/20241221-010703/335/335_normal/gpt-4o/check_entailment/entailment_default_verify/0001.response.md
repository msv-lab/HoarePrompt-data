Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case where `main_string` is an empty string. Although the provided output hints suggest adding a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` if `main_string` is empty, this omission means the program is not fully correct according to the problem description. The program should return `None` for an empty `main_string`, which is not handled currently. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as per the given problem description.
