Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected in all given scenarios, including cases where the substring is not found (returning `None`). The original assessment was correct in stating that the function handles the cases provided in the assertions, and the annotations further validate this behavior. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
