Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string and returns `None` if the substring is not found. The annotations support this behavior:

1. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring.
2. If the substring is not found (`start_pos == -1`), the function returns `None`.
3. If the substring is found, the function calculates the end position as `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions.

All provided test cases in the annotated version demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. The function handles all given cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment as True is appropriate.
