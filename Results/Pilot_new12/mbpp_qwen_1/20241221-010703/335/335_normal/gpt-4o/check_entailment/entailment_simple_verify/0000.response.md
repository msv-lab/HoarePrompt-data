Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring and calculates the end position accordingly. All the provided test cases demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. The annotated version confirms that the function handles both the presence and absence of the substring correctly, and the postconditions described in the annotations support the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
