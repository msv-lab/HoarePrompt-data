Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the `main_string` is an empty string. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if there is no match, which includes the scenario where the `main_string` itself is empty. The output hints correctly point out that adding a check for an empty `main_string` is necessary. Since the code does not include this check, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
