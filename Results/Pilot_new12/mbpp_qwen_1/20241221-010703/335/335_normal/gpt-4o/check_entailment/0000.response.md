Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring and calculates the end position accordingly. All the provided test cases demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Since the function handles all given cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
