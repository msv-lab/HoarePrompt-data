Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the substring appears multiple times within the main string. According to the problem description, the function should return the first occurrence of the substring along with its starting and ending positions. However, the assertions provided only test for single occurrences and the absence of a substring. To properly verify the correctness, consider a case where the substring appears multiple times:

Example:
```
assert func_1('python python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
```

In this case, the function returns the first occurrence of 'python', but the assertion checks for the first occurrence. Since the function returns the first match, it meets the requirement. However, we need to ensure that the function handles all cases correctly, including multiple occurrences. The function is correct based on the provided tests, but the problem description could be clearer about handling multiple occurrences. Given the current tests and the problem description, the function is correct. 

However, since the problem description asks to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the provided function handles the cases correctly, we conclude it is correct. But strictly following the format:

Correctness: **True**
