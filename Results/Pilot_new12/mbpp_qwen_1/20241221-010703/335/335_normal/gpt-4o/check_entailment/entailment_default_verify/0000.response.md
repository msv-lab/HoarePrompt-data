Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct because it handles all the provided test cases correctly and aligns with the problem description. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the case where `main_string` is an empty string. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if there is no match, and an empty string is a potential scenario that needs to be considered. Therefore, since the function does not account for an empty `main_string`, the original assessment is not fully accurate. The function needs to be updated to return `None` when `main_string` is empty to meet the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
