Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It should return the substring along with its starting and ending positions if found; otherwise, it should return `None`.

2. **Return Values**:
   - When the substring is found in the main string, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position (`start_pos`), and its ending position (`end_pos`). The ending position is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.
   - If the substring is not found in the main string, the function returns `None`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
     - `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)` checks for a simple exact match at the beginning.
     - `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)` checks for a match within the string.
     - `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)` checks for another substring that exists later in the string.
     - `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None` checks for a case where the substring does not exist in the main string.

4. **Code Logic**:
   - The function uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to find the starting index of the substring. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`.
   - If `start_pos` is `-1`, the function immediately returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the ending position (`end_pos`) and returns the substring along with its positions.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality for all given cases and matches the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
