Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters. If the resulting set contains exactly one unique character, it means all characters in the string are the same, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach satisfies the problem description, which states: "Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not." The function works as intended for any valid string input, including empty strings, and handles all alphabetic characters uniformly. It does not consider non-alphabetic characters separately, but the problem description does not specify handling of such characters, so this is within the scope of the given problem.
