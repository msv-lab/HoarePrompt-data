Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by using the fact that converting the string to a set removes duplicates. If the resulting set has exactly one element, it means all characters in the string are identical. This approach works for strings of any length, including the empty string, which is correctly identified as having all identical characters (vacuously true). The function does not account for non-alphabetic characters as part of the problem description, so it does not fail in doing so. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem.
