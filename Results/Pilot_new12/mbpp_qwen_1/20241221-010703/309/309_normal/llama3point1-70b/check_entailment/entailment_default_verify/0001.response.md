Final: **False**

Reason: While the original assessment correctly notes that the function `func_1(s)` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1, it fails to address the potential issue highlighted in the output hints. Specifically, the function does not distinguish between alphabetic characters and other types of characters (e.g., numbers or symbols). If the string contains non-alphabetic characters and they are all the same, the function will still return `True`, which is not necessarily correct according to the problem description that implies a focus on comparing alphabetic characters only. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate as it does not consider this edge case.
