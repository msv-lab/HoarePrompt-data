Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the set contains only one unique character. This approach works for all potential cases, including the empty string, where it correctly returns `True` since there are no differing characters. The program does not rely on specific types of characters (like alphabetic characters) and will correctly handle strings containing non-alphabetic characters as well. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
