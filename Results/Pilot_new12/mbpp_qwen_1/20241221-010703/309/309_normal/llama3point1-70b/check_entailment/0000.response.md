Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach correctly identifies strings where all characters are identical and returns `True` for such cases. It also correctly returns `False` for strings with different characters. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases, the program is correct.
