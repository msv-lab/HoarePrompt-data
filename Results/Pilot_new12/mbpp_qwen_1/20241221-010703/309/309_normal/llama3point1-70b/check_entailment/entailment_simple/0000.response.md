Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters in the string are identical; otherwise, they are not. This approach correctly identifies whether all characters in the string are the same, fulfilling the problem description accurately for any non-empty string input.
