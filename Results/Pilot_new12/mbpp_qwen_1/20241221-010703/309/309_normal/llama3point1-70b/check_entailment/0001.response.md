Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases because:
- If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one unique character.
- If there is even one different character, the set will contain more than one unique character.

Since the function correctly identifies both scenarios (all characters the same or not), it meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
