Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment assumes that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the string are the same, which is true based on the provided code. However, the output hints point out that the function does not account for cases where the string might contain non-alphabetic characters (like numbers or symbols). For example, a string like `"111"` or `"!!!"` would still return `True`, even though the problem description likely intended for the function to only consider alphabetic characters. Since the function does not handle these cases as expected, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect that the function is not fully correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
