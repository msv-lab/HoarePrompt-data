Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. 

- The function first checks if the string `s` is empty using `if (not s) :`. Since the problem assumes the input is valid and non-empty, this check immediately returns `True`, which aligns with the assumption that the string is non-empty.
- For non-empty strings, the function sets `first_char` to the first character of the string and then iterates through each character in the string to check if they are all equal to `first_char`. If any character is different, the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, the function returns `True`.

The test cases provided also validate the expected behavior:
- `assert func_1('python') == False`: 'python' has all different characters, so it should return `False`.
- `assert func_1('aaa') == True`: 'aaa' has the same character repeated, so it should return `True`.
- `assert func_1('data') == False`: 'data' has different characters, so it should return `False`.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for the given test cases.
