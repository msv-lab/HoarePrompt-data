Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It correctly returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters are identical, and `False` otherwise. Based on the examples provided:

- `func_1('python') == False` (Correct, because not all characters are the same)
- `func_1('aaa') == True` (Correct, because all characters are the same)
- `func_1('data') == False` (Correct, because not all characters are the same)

The function logic is sound and handles all cases appropriately, including the edge case of an empty string. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
