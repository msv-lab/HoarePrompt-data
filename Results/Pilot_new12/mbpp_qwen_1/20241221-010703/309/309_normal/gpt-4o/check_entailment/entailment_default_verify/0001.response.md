Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function logic is sound, handling edge cases such as an empty string and strings with all identical characters. The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, and the provided assertions confirm its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
