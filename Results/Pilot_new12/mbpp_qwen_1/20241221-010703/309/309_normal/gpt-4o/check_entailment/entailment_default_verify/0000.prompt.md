You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It correctly returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters are identical, and `False` otherwise. Based on the examples provided:

- `func_1('python') == False` (Correct, because not all characters are the same)
- `func_1('aaa') == True` (Correct, because all characters are the same)
- `func_1('data') == False` (Correct, because not all characters are the same)

The function logic is sound and handles all cases appropriately, including the edge case of an empty string. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the first character of the string and then iterates through the entire string to verify that every character matches the first one. If at least one character differs, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the input string is non-empty, as it immediately returns `True` if the string is empty (which would violate the requirement).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
