Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. It first handles the case where the string is empty by immediately returning `True`, which aligns with the problem description. For non-empty strings, it checks each character against the first character and returns `False` as soon as a mismatch is found. This logic correctly identifies when all characters are the same and when they are not. All the provided test cases (`'python'`, `'aaa'`, `'data'`) are handled correctly, and the code seems to cover the necessary conditions for the problem description.
