Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same, as described in the problem statement. The function logic is sound, and it handles all given test cases correctly. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, checking the first character and then iterating through the string to ensure all characters match. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases are valid, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
