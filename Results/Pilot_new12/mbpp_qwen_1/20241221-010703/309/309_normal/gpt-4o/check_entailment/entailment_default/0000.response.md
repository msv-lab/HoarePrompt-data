Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function first handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True` immediately, which aligns with the problem description that it should return `True` if all characters are the same (and an empty string trivially satisfies this condition). For non-empty strings, it compares each character with the first character and returns `False` as soon as it finds a mismatch. The assertions provided also validate the expected behavior:

- `func_1('python') == False` (All characters are different)
- `func_1('aaa') == True` (All characters are the same)
- `func_1('data') == False` (Not all characters are the same)

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, and the code handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
