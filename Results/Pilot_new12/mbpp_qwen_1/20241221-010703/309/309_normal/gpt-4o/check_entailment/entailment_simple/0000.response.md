Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the string is empty. According to the problem description, the function should meet the requirements with a non-empty string, but returning `True` for an empty string would also technically satisfy the problem as no characters are being compared. However, returning `True` for an empty string might be considered more intuitive, but it is not explicitly required by the problem statement.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function takes a non-empty string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `first_char` with the first character of the string.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is different from `first_char`. If any character differs, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.
   - If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, it means all characters in the string are the same, so the function returns `True`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions:
     - `func_1('python') == False`: This is correct because 'python' contains different characters.
     - `func_1('aaa') == True`: This is correct because 'aaa' contains the same character.
     - `func_1('data') == False`: This is correct because 'data' contains different characters.

Since the function meets the requirements described in the problem and passes the provided test cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
