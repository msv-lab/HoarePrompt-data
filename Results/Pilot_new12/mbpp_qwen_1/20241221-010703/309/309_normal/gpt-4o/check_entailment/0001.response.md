Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. The function works by comparing each character in the string with the first character. If any character differs from the first, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. 

The function handles all cases correctly:
- An empty string returns `True` (as specified).
- A string with all identical characters returns `True`.
- A string with different characters returns `False`.

The provided test cases also cover these scenarios:
- `func_1('python')` returns `False`, which is correct because not all characters are the same.
- `func_1('aaa')` returns `True`, which is correct because all characters are the same.
- `func_1('data')` returns `False`, which is correct because not all characters are the same.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and there are no apparent logical errors, the program is correct.
