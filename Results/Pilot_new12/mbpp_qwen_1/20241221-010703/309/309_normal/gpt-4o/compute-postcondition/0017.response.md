Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the first character of the string and then iterates through the entire string to verify that every character matches the first one. If at least one character differs, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the input string is non-empty, as it immediately returns `True` if the string is empty (which would violate the requirement).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string is empty, the function should not execute because the precondition states that `s` is a non-empty string. However, the function handles this case by returning `True` directly without entering the loop, which is correct based on the problem statement.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code. All logical paths and conditions are handled correctly, and the postconditions align with the described behavior.
