The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character, and `first_char` will be set to the first character of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
