Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The condition `if char != first_char:` checks if the current character `char` is different from the first character of the string `first_char`.
- If any character in `s` is different from `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any character different from `first_char`, it means all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.

Given the initial state where `s` is a non-empty string and `first_char` is the first character of `s`, the loop will continue to check each character. After the loop finishes, it confirms that every character in `s` matches `first_char`.

Thus, the final output state is that `s` is a non-empty string where all characters are equal to `first_char`.
