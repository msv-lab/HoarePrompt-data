Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `char` is the second character of `s`.
   - If `char` is not equal to the first character of `s`, the function returns `False`.

2. **Current Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` is the second character of `s`.
   - This means the loop has already processed the first character and moved to the second character.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, the loop should process the third character of the string `s`.
   - Therefore, `char` should be the third character of `s`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, it must have at least three characters for the loop to continue.
   - After processing the third character, `char` will be the third character of `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `s` is a non-empty string (still true).
- `char` is the third character of `s`.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character of `s`**
