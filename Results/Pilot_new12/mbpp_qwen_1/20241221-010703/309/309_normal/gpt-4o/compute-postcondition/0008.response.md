According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. If `char` is still within the bounds of the string `s`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is equal to `first_char`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `char` must still be within the bounds of the string `s`.

Therefore, `char` will now be the second character of `s`, and `s` remains a non-empty string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of `s`, and `char` is equal to the next character in `s`**
