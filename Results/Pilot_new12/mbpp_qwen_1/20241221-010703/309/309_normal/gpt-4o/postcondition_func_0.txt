The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the first character of the string and then iterates through the entire string to verify that every character matches the first one. If at least one character differs, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the input string is non-empty, as it immediately returns `True` if the string is empty (which would violate the requirement).
