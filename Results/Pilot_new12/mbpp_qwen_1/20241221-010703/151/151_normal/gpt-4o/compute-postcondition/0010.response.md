Postcondition: **`nested_list` contains at least one element. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` contains all the elements from processing `nested_list` and also includes the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all the elements from processing `nested_list`, plus the item.**
