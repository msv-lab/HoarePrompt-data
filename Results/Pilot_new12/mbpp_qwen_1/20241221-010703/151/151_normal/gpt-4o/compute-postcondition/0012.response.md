The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `nested_list` contains at least one element and there are no specific values given for `nested_list`, `func_1`, or `item`, we cannot determine the exact values added to `flat_list`. But we know that `flat_list` has been extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element; `flat_list` has been extended by the elements returned by `func_1(item)`**
