The code snippet `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` impacts the `flat_list` variable by extending it with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `nested_list` or the function `func_1`, we can only state that `flat_list` now includes all the elements from `func_1(item)`.

The `nested_list` remains unchanged, and the state of `flat_list` is updated to include the elements from `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, `flat_list` contains all the elements from processing `nested_list` and also includes the elements returned by `func_1(item)`**
