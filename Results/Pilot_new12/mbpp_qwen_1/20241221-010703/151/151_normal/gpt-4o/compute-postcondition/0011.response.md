To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the conditions and requirements given:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `nested_list` contains at least one element.
   - If `item` is a list, `flat_list` contains all the elements from processing `nested_list` and also includes the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.
   - Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all the elements from processing `nested_list`, plus the item.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must still contain at least one element. 

Since we are not given specific details about the changes in `flat_list` or the exact nature of `item` within the loop body, we focus on the condition that must hold true for the loop to continue. The only requirement for the loop to continue is that `nested_list` should have at least one element remaining.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `nested_list` must contain at least one element.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element**
