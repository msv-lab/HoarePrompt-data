The code `flat_list.append(item)` appends the value of `item` to the `flat_list`. Since `item` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `flat_list` was initially an empty list, and now it will contain at least one element, which is `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` contains at least one element, which is `item`; each item in `nested_list` is not a list**
