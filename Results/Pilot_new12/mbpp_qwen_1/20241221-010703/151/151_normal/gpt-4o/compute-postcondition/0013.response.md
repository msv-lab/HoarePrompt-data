`flat_list` is appending the value of `item`. The exact value of `item` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that `nested_list` contains at least one element. Therefore, `item` could be one of the elements from `nested_list`. After executing the line `flat_list.append(item)`, the `flat_list` will contain all the elements from `nested_list`, including the new `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element; `flat_list` now includes all elements from `nested_list` plus the new `item`.**
