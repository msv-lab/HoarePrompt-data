State before the loop starts: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the condition under which the loop will run. The loop will execute if `nested_list` contains at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for item in nested_list:` will execute if `nested_list` is not empty.
2. **Initial State**: Given that `nested_list` is initially a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level) and `flat_list` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `nested_list` is not empty for the loop to execute.
3. **Adjusting the State**: To satisfy the condition for the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nested_list` must contain at least one element.

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list**
