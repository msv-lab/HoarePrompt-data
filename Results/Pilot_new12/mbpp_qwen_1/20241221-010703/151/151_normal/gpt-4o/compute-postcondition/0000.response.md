The code initializes an empty list called `flat_list`. The initial state of `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), which is not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `flat_list` variable.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
