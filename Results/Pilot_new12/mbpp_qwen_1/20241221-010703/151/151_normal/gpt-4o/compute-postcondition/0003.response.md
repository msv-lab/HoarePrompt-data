The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Since the current item being processed is a list, `func_1(item)` returns the elements of that list. The `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Given that the current item being processed is a list, let's denote it as `current_list`. So, `func_1(current_list)` returns the elements of `current_list`. After calling `extend`, the `flat_list` will include these elements.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` is now a list containing all the elements from `func_1(current_list)`; the current item being processed is a list.**
