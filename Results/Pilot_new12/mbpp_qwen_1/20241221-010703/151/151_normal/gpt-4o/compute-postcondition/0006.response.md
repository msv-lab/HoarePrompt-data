Postcondition: ***`nested_list` contains at least one element, and `flat_list` is a list containing all the elements from processing `nested_list`. If the current item is a list, it is flattened into `flat_list`. Otherwise, `item` is added to `flat_list` if it is not already part of the nested structure.***
