Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure, meaning it should take a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level) and return a single-level list containing all the elements from the nested structure.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: When the function encounters an element that is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: When the function encounters an element that is a list, it recursively calls itself on this sublist and extends the result to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all nested structures are processed and flattened.

3. **Final Return**: After processing all elements in the input list, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the nested structure in a single-level list.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different types of input, including lists with varying levels of nesting and different data structures within the nested lists.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and always produces the expected output for the given inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
