Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively extending the `flat_list` with elements from nested lists. The function handles both direct integers and nested lists, ensuring that all elements are eventually appended to the `flat_list`. Given the provided test cases and the nature of the recursive approach, the function appears to handle various scenarios of nested lists correctly. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
