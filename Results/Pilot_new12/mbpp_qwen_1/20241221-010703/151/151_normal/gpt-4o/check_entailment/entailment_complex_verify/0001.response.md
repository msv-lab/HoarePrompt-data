Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function handles both direct integers and nested lists, ensuring that all elements are eventually appended to the `flat_list`. The recursive approach ensures that all levels of nesting are processed correctly. Given the test cases and the nature of the recursive approach, there is no indication that the function would fail for any valid input as per the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness as True is justified.
