Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly flatten a nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively processes each element of the input list. If an element is a list, the function calls itself on this sublist and extends the result to the current flat list. If the element is not a list, it is directly appended to the flat list. This approach ensures that all nested structures are removed, resulting in a single-level list containing all the original elements.

The examples given demonstrate that the function works as expected for various inputs:

1. `func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])` results in `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`.
2. `func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]])` results in `[10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]`.
3. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]`.

Given the recursive nature of the function and the examples provided, the code seems to handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
