Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports this assessment by clearly explaining the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and returns a flattened list containing all elements from the nested structure. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with multiple levels of nesting. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is supported by both the problem description and the annotated version of the code.
