Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all the elements from the nested structure. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if each item in the input list is itself a list using `isinstance(item, list)`. If it is, the function recursively calls itself on that sublist, effectively handling nested structures of any depth.

2. **Element Appending**: If the item is not a list, it is directly appended to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all elements are included in the final flattened list.

3. **Recursive Structure**: The recursive nature of the function ensures that even deeply nested lists are fully flattened. Each nested list is processed individually, contributing its elements to the `flat_list`.

4. **Edge Cases**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list with elements that are either integers or other lists), the function does not need to handle invalid inputs like non-lists or empty lists.

Thus, the program correctly flattens any given nested list structure into a single list of integers, meeting the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
