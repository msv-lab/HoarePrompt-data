Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element and if it is a list, it calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the current list with the flattened result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to the current list. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nested structure, are included in the final flat list. Based on the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the given inputs. There doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential input that would make this function incorrect based on the problem description.
