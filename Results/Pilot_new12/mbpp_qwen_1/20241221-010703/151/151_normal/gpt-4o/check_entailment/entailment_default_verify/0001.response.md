Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively extending the `flat_list` with elements from nested lists. The function handles both direct integers and nested lists, ensuring that all elements are eventually appended to the `flat_list`. The output hints confirm that the function processes each element of the input list, recursively handling nested lists and appending non-list elements directly. Given the problem description and the nature of the recursive approach, the function appears to handle various scenarios of nested lists correctly. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information.
