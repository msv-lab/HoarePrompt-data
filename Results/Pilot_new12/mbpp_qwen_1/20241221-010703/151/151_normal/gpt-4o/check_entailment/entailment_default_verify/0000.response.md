Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling nested lists and returning a single-level list with all original elements. The provided test cases also support the correctness of the function. There are no indications from the code, problem description, or output hints that suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is justified.
