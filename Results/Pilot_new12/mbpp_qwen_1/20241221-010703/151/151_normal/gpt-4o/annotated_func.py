#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level).
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` contains a list of integers or nested lists (possibly at multiple levels), `flat_list` is a list containing all the elements from `nested_list` after fully flattening the nested structure. If the loop does not execute, `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    return flat_list
    #`The program returns an empty list flat_list since the loop does not execute`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version of this list, where all nested structures are removed, resulting in a single-level list containing all the original elements. If the input `nested_list` is empty or contains no nested lists, the function returns an empty list. The function recursively processes each element of the input list: if an element is itself a list, the function calls itself on this sublist and extends the result to the current flat list; otherwise, the element is directly appended to the flat list.
