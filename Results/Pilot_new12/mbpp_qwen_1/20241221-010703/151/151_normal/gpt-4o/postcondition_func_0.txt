The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version of this list, where all nested structures are removed, resulting in a single-level list containing all the original elements. If the input `nested_list` is empty or contains no nested lists, the function returns an empty list. The function recursively processes each element of the input list: if an element is itself a list, the function calls itself on this sublist and extends the result to the current flat list; otherwise, the element is directly appended to the flat list.
