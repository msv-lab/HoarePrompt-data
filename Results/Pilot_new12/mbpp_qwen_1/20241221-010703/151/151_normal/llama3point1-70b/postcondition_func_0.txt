The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested lists). It recursively flattens `nested_list` by expanding all nested lists into their elements, resulting in a new list called `flat_list`. This process continues until all elements within the nested structure are integers. The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the integer elements from the original `nested_list` in a flattened form. Potential edge cases include when `nested_list` is empty, contains only non-list elements, or contains a mix of integers and lists. The function handles these cases by appropriately traversing and expanding the nested structure.
