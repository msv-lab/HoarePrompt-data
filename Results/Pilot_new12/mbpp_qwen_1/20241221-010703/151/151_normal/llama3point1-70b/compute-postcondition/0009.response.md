`flat_list.append(i)` appends the current element `i` from `nested_list` to `flat_list`. The value of `nested_list` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged because the code does not modify `i`. The output state is that `flat_list` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the current element from `nested_list`, `flat_list` has been updated with the value of `i`.**
