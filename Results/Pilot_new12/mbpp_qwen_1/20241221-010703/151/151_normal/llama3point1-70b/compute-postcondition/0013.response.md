The code appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the next element from `nested_list`, it could either be a list or not a list. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` would be extended with the result of `func_1(i)`. However, the code only appends `i` directly to `flat_list` regardless of whether `i` is a list or not. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the next element from `nested_list`, `flat_list` is updated with the value of `i`.**
