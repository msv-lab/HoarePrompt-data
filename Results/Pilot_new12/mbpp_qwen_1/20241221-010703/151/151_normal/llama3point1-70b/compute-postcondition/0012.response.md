`flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the next element from `nested_list`. The value of `i` can be a list or a non-list value. If `i` is a list, `func_1(i)` will be called, and its result will be added to `flat_list`. If `i` is not a list, `i` itself will be added to `flat_list`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the next element from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`**
