According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, it updates `flat_list` with the value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `nested_list` must still have elements remaining.
- `i` is the current element from `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` has been updated accordingly (either extended with the result of `func_1(i)` or updated with the value of `i`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must still have elements remaining. Therefore, we need to ensure that the next element `i` comes from the remaining elements in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the next element from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been updated. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` is updated with the value of `i`.**
