Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`, assigning each element to the variable `i` in each iteration.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `i` is either a list or a non-list variable.
   - If `i` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements from `func_1(i)`.
   - If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the value of `i`.

3. **Identify the Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, `nested_list` must still have elements remaining.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` could be a list or a non-list variable.
   - `flat_list` has been updated according to the value of `i` from the previous iteration.

5. **Prepare for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `i` was a list, it has been processed, and `nested_list` will now contain the next element (if any).
   - If `i` was not a list, `nested_list` will now contain the next element (if any).

Given the above analysis, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- Since we don't know the exact nature of `i` from the previous iteration (whether it was a list or not), we need to consider both cases.
- If `i` was a list, `nested_list` should now contain the next element.
- If `i` was not a list, `nested_list` should also now contain the next element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is either a list or a non-list variable.
- `flat_list` has been updated based on the previous value of `i`.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is either a list or a non-list variable, and `flat_list` has been updated based on the previous value of `i`**.

However, to be more precise and specific, we can reframe this as:
State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the current element from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been updated based on the previous value of `i`**.
