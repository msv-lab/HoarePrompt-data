`flat_list` extends its contents with the result of `func_1(i)`. The function `func_1(i)` is applied to the current element `i` from `nested_list`, and its return value (a list) is added to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the current element from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been updated by extending itself with the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must still have elements remaining, `i` is the current element from `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been updated by extending itself with the result of `func_1(i)`**
