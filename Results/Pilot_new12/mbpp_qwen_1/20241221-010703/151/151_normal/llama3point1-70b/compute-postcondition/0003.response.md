The code snippet `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` extends the `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `i` or the function `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `flat_list` after the operation. However, we know that `i` is a list, and `func_1(i)` returns a list which is then extended into `flat_list`.

Output State: **`i` is a list; `flat_list` is the original `flat_list` extended with the elements from `func_1(i)`**
