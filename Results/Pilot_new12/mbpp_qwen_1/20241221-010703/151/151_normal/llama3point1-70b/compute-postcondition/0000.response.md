The code initializes an empty list called `flat_list`. This does not modify any existing elements in `nested_list`, but rather creates a new list. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) as elements; `flat_list` is an empty list**
