The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) as elements. After executing the function body, the function returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists have been expanded into their elements.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` that may contain integers or other lists, and return a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists have been expanded into their elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, returns a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists have been expanded into their elements.**
