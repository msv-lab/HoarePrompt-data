To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the structure and initial state of the `nested_list`. The loop will iterate over each element in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one item.

Given that `nested_list` can contain integers or other lists (nested lists), let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Ensure `nested_list` contains at least one element**: This ensures there is something to iterate over in the loop.
2. **Set the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being the first element in `nested_list`, we need to specify what `i` is initially.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no elements to iterate over.
- We need to adjust the state such that `nested_list` is non-empty.
- The variable `i` will take the first element of `nested_list`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `nested_list` is not empty and to set the initial value of `i` to the first element in `nested_list`.

**State:**
**`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) as elements, `nested_list` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
