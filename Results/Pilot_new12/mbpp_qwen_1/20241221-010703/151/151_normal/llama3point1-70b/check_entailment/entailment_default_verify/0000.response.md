Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases, including when the input is an empty list, contains only non-list elements, or contains a mix of integers and lists. The recursive approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are added to the final flattened list. Since the problem description asks to write a function to flatten a given nested list structure, and the provided code satisfies this requirement without any apparent logical errors or missing cases, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
