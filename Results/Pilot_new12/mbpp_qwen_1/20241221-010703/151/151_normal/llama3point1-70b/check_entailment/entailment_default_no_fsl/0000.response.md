Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively extending the `flat_list` with elements from nested lists. It handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including an empty list, a list with only non-list elements, and a mix of integers and lists. The function works correctly for all these scenarios without any issues. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
