Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The annotated version confirms that the function recursively processes each element in the input list, appending integers directly to `flat_list` and extending `flat_list` with the result of recursively calling `func_1` on nested lists. The annotations also cover potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing only non-list elements, indicating that the function handles these scenarios appropriately. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
