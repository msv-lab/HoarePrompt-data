You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each element of the nested list. If an element is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are added to the final flattened list. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that this code does not handle, making it correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) as elements.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) as elements; `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists have been expanded into their elements using `func_1`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all nested lists have been expanded into their elements using `func_1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested lists). It recursively flattens `nested_list` by expanding all nested lists into their elements, resulting in a new list called `flat_list`. This process continues until all elements within the nested structure are integers. The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the integer elements from the original `nested_list` in a flattened form. Potential edge cases include when `nested_list` is empty, contains only non-list elements, or contains a mix of integers and lists. The function handles these cases by appropriately traversing and expanding the nested structure.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
