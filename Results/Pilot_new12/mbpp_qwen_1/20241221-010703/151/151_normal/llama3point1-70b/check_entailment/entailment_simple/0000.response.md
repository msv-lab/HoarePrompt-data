Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input, which can contain integers or other lists (nested lists), and returns a `flat_list` that contains all the elements from the nested structure without any nested lists remaining.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: If an element in `nested_list` is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: If an element in `nested_list` is a list, the function calls itself recursively with this element, flattening any further nested structures. The result of the recursive call is then extended to `flat_list`.

3. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns `flat_list`, which is a fully flattened version of the original `nested_list`.

Given these points, the program will correctly flatten any nested list structure, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
