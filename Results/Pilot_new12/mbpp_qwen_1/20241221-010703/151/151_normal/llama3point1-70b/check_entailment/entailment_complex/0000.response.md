Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a nested list `nested_list` as input and recursively flattens it into a single list of integers. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists). This matches the expected input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle nested lists. For each element in the `nested_list`, it checks if the element is a list. If it is, the function calls itself (`func_1(i)`) and extends the `flat_list` with the result of the recursive call. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When `nested_list` is empty, the function simply returns an empty `flat_list`, which is correct.
   - When `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, the function will directly append those elements to `flat_list`, again, producing the correct result.
   - When `nested_list` contains a mix of integers and lists, the function correctly handles this by recursively processing nested lists and appending integers directly.

4. **Output**: The function returns the `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of the input `nested_list`. This output aligns with the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly flattens the nested list according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
