Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each element of the nested list. If an element is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are added to the final flattened list. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that this code does not handle, making it correct according to the problem description.
