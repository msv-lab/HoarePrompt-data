Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function iterates through each element of the `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist, and if it is not a list, it appends the element to `flat_list`. This process ensures that all elements from the nested structure are included in the final flattened list. The annotations align with the function's behavior, supporting the original assessment that the program is correct.
