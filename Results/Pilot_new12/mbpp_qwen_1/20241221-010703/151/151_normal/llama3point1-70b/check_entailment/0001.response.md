Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element of the input list. If the element is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist. Otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements from the nested structure are included in the final flattened list, regardless of how deeply nested the lists are. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
