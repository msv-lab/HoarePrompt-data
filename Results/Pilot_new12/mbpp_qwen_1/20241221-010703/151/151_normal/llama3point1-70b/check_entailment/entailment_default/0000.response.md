Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element in the `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that list. If the element is not a list, it appends it directly to `flat_list`. The function handles various cases, including nested lists of arbitrary depth, empty lists, and lists containing only non-list elements. Given the recursive nature of the function and the way it processes each element, it ensures that all integers within the nested structure are flattened into a single list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended for all described scenarios.
