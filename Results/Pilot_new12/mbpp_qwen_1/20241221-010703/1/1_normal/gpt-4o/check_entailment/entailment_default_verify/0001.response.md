Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description. The function handles cases where one or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple, and it correctly sorts and returns the common elements. Given the provided assertions and the logical structure of the function, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
