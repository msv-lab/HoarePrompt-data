Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds and returns the common elements from the two input lists as tuples. The annotated version confirms that the function first converts the input lists into sets to find their intersection and then returns a sorted tuple of these common elements. The provided assertions validate that the function behaves as expected for the given integer inputs. Since the function logic is sound and the assertions pass, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
