Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version and the provided assertions, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the common elements from the two input lists as tuples. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. The annotated version clearly describes the steps taken by the function and confirms that it returns the expected results for the given examples. Since the function handles the provided examples and the logic seems sound, it is likely to work for any similar cases involving integer inputs. Therefore, the function meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
