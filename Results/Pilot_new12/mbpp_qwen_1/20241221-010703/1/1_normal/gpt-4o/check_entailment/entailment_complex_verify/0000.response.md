Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotated version further clarifies that the function handles empty lists by returning an empty tuple and that it only includes unique elements that are present in both input lists. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as intended for various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
