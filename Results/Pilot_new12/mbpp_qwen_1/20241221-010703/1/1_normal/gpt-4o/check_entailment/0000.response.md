Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements between them. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. This approach correctly identifies all common elements and sorts them, which aligns with the problem description. Given the provided test cases, the function works as expected for the shared elements. Since no counterexample has been found where the function does not meet the requirements, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
