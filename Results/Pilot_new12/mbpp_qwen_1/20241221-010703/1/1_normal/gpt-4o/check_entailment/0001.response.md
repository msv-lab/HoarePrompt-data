Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the common elements from the two input lists as tuples. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. Given the assertions provided, the function works correctly for the cases where the lists contain integers. Since the function handles the provided examples and the logic seems sound, it is likely to work for any similar cases involving integer inputs. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the examples, the function appears to be correct.
