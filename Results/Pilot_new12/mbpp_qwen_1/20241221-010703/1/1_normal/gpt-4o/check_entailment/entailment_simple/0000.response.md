Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description for finding the shared elements between two lists. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters (`list1` and `list2`), which aligns with the problem description asking for a function to take two lists as inputs.

2. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - The function converts both lists into sets using `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`.
   - It then uses the set intersection operator `&` to find common elements between the two sets.
   - Finally, it converts the resulting set back into a sorted tuple using `sorted()` and `tuple()`, ensuring the output is a tuple of sorted common elements.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with different inputs and expected outputs, verifying that the function correctly identifies and returns the shared elements as tuples in sorted order.

Since the program consistently implements the required logic to find and return the sorted common elements between two lists, it meets the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
