Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior and aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, finds their common elements using set operations, and returns these elements as a sorted tuple. The provided output hints further confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either of the lists is empty. Given the problem description and the test cases, the function meets the requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
