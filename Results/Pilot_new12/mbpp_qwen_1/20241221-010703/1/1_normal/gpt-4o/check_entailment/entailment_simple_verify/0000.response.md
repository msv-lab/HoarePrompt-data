Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements between them. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly identifies the common elements using sets and returns them as a sorted tuple. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, there is no evidence from the annotations or additional information that suggests the program is incorrect based on the problem description.
