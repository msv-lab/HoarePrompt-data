Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly finds the shared elements from the given two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function `func_1` handles the following cases:
1. It returns the common elements between the two lists.
2. It returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements.
3. It sorts the common elements before returning them.
4. It works with different types of inputs (e.g., `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `[5, 7, 4, 10]`).

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in these scenarios. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
