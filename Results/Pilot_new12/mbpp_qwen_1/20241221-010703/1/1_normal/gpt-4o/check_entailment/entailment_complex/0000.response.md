Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists and return them as a sorted tuple.
2. **Set Intersection**: The function uses set intersection (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) to identify common elements between the two lists. This ensures that the function works correctly regardless of the order of elements within each list.
3. **Sorting and Returning**: The resulting set of common elements is converted into a sorted tuple using `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. This guarantees that the output is always sorted and unique.
4. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description does not explicitly mention handling edge cases such as empty lists or non-list inputs, the provided assertions implicitly cover these scenarios. For example, if either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the intersection will result in an empty set, which gets converted to an empty tuple as expected.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the expected inputs correctly, the program is considered correct.
