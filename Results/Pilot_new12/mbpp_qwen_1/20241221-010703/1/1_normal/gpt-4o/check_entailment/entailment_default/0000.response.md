Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements found in both lists. The code uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. The examples provided in the output hints match the behavior of the function, and the function handles all the cases described without any issues. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
