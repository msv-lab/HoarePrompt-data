The code creates a set containing the common elements between `list1` and `list2`. However, the exact values of the elements in the lists are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values in the `common_elements` set. But we know that `common_elements` will contain only the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is a set containing elements present in both `list1` and `list2`**
