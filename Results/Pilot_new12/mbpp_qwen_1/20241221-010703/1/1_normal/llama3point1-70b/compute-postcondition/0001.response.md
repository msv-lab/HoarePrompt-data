The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and return a tuple containing the intersection of elements from both tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.**
