Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. If either of the input tuples is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
- If one of the tuples is empty and the other is non-empty, the function will still return an empty tuple.
