Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two input tuples. The function uses sets to find common elements and then converts the result back into a tuple. This approach correctly identifies shared elements between the two input tuples and handles all potential cases where elements may or may not be present in both tuples. Since the function meets the requirements for every potential case, the correctness is True.
