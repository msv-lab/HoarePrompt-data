Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two tuples and returns them as a tuple. It handles the case where either of the input tuples is empty by returning an empty tuple. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function works as expected for every potential case described.
