Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from both tuples. This directly follows the requirement to find shared elements from the given two lists (tuples in this case). The use of `set` to find the intersection and converting it back to a tuple ensures that the output format matches the expected result. Since the problem description specifies working with tuples, and the function correctly processes them to produce the required output, the program is correct according to the given requirements.
