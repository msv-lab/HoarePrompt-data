Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find shared elements from two given tuples. It handles all potential cases, including when one or both of the input tuples are empty, by returning an empty tuple in such scenarios. The use of sets to find the intersection ensures that only unique shared elements are returned, which aligns with the problem description. The provided output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, further supporting the original assessment of correctness.
