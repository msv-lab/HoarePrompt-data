Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses sets to find the intersection of the two tuples and then converts the result back into a tuple. This approach works correctly for finding shared elements, but there is a critical issue: the order of elements in the output tuple is not guaranteed. According to the problem description, the function should find shared elements, but it does not specify that the order of elements in the result should be preserved. However, the program's behavior can be problematic if the order of elements matters in the context of the problem.

For example, consider the following inputs:
```
test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
test_tup2 = (3, 4, 5, 6)
```
The expected output could be `(3, 4)` or `(4, 3)` depending on how the set operation handles the order internally. If the order of elements needs to be preserved, this implementation will fail to meet the requirements.

To ensure the order is preserved, a different approach such as using list comprehension and checking each element could be used:

```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(x for x in test_tup1 if x in test_tup2)
```

This version will maintain the order of elements from the first tuple that are also present in the second tuple.
