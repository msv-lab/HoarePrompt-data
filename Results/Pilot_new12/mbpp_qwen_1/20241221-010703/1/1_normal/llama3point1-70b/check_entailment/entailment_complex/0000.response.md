Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of these two tuples. The use of `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` ensures that only the common elements between the two tuples are retained, and converting the resulting set back into a tuple ensures the output format matches the expected result. This approach handles all cases where both input tuples can contain any type of elements (assuming they are hashable), and it correctly returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements. Thus, the function always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
