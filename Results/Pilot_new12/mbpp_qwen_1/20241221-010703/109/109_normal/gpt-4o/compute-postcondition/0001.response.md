The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. The function returns a list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` except the last element with all elements in `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list containing all elements of `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements of `list2`.
