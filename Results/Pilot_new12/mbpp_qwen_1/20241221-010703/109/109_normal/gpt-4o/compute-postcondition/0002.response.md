Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list. This new list contains all elements of `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements of `list2`. 

Potential edge cases to consider:
1. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function still behaves correctly by only including elements from `list1` (excluding the last element) or `list2` as appropriate.
2. If `list1` has only one element, that single element will be excluded from the returned list.
3. If `list1` is empty, the returned list will only contain elements from `list2`.
4. If `list2` is empty, the returned list will only contain elements from `list1` (excluding the last element if present).

The function does not modify the original lists; it creates and returns a new list.**

Note: The annotation accurately describes the function's behavior without any missing logic or edge cases.**
