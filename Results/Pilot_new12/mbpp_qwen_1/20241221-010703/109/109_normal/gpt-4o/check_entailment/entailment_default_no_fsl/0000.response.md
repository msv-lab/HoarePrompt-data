Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. It handles various edge cases such as empty lists and lists with different lengths. The function creates a new list by slicing `list1` (excluding the last element) and concatenating it with `list2`. This behavior matches the problem description and the output hints provided. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case under the given assumptions.
