Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. However, upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the function actually removes the last element of the first list and concatenates the second list to the remaining elements of the first list. This means the function does not replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list, but rather removes the last element of the first list and appends the second list to it. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the function does not meet the problem description.
