Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with all elements of the second list (`list2`). The output hints align with this functionality and cover potential edge cases such as empty lists. The function does not modify the original lists but returns a new list, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as True remains valid.
