Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a new list where the last element of the first list (`list1`) is replaced by the elements of the second list (`list2`). 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists as specified in the problem description.
2. The line `return list1[:-1] + list2` ensures that the last element of `list1` is removed and the elements of `list2` are appended to the truncated `list1`. This effectively replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
3. The provided test cases verify that the function behaves as expected:
   - In the first test case, the last element of `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` (which is `10`) is replaced by the elements of `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
   - In the second test case, the last element of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (which is `5`) is replaced by the elements of `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
   - In the third test case, the last element of `['red', 'blue', 'green']` (which is `'green'`) is replaced by the single element of `['yellow']`, resulting in `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`.

Since the function correctly implements the specified behavior and the test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
