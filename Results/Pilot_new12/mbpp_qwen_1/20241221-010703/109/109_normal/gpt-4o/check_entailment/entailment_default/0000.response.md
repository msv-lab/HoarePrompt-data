Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). The function achieves this by using list slicing (`list1[:-1]`), which removes the last element of `list1`, and concatenating it with `list2`. The function handles various edge cases as well:

1. If `list1` is empty, `list1[:-1]` results in an empty list, and the function returns the elements of `list2`.
2. If `list2` is empty, the function returns `list1[:-1]`, which is correct because it excludes the last element of `list1`.
3. If `list1` has only one element, that single element will be excluded from the returned list, which is the expected behavior.
4. The function does not modify the original lists; it creates and returns a new list, which is consistent with the problem description.

All provided test cases and the general logic of the function indicate that it works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement.
