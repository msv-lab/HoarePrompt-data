Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2` if `list1` is not empty. If `list1` is empty, it correctly assigns `list2` to `list1`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both non-empty and empty lists appropriately. There are no contradictions between the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
