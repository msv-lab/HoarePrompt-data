Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). The annotations clearly indicate that if `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with `list2`, and if `list1` is empty, `list1` is set to `list2`. This behavior matches the problem description perfectly. There are no issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the given annotations and problem description.
