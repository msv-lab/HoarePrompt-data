Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if `list1` is non-empty using the condition `if list1 :`. This ensures that the function handles the case where `list1` is not empty.

2. **Replacing Last Element**:
   - If `list1` is non-empty, the line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. Since `list1[-1:]` refers to the last element of `list1`, this operation effectively removes the last element of `list1` and replaces it with the entire `list2`.

3. **Handling Empty `list1`**:
   - If `list1` is empty (`else` block), the function assigns `list2` directly to `list1`. In this case, `list1` becomes exactly `list2`, which is the expected behavior.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns `list1`, which is either modified (if `list1` was non-empty) or replaced entirely (if `list1` was empty).

5. **Unchanged Input Lists**:
   - The problem description mentions that `list2` should remain unchanged, and the function achieves this by not modifying `list2` during its execution.

Since the function handles both cases (non-empty and empty `list1`) as per the problem description and ensures that `list2` remains unchanged, the program is correct.
