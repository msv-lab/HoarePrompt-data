Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as inputs. 
   - It first checks if `list1` is not empty using the condition `if list1 :`. This ensures that the function handles both non-empty and empty lists appropriately.

2. **Replacing the Last Element**:
   - If `list1` is not empty (`if list1 :`), the last element of `list1` (i.e., `list1[-1:]`) is replaced with all elements of `list2` (`list1[-1:] = list2`). 
   - This operation effectively appends all elements of `list2` to the end of `list1`, replacing its last element(s).

3. **Handling Empty `list1`**:
   - If `list1` is empty (`else` block), `list1` is directly assigned the value of `list2` (`list1 = list2`). 
   - This means `list1` becomes exactly `list2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns `list1`, which is either modified according to the conditions mentioned or remains unchanged if `list1` was already empty.

5. **Unchanged `list2`**:
   - The function ensures that `list2` remains unchanged throughout the execution, which is also explicitly stated in the problem description.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
