The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. If `list1` is not empty, `list1` ends with `list2` instead of its original last element; otherwise, `list1` remains unchanged and is the same as `list2`. `list2` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters list1 and list2, where if list1 is not empty, it ends with list2; otherwise, it remains unchanged and is the same as list2. list2 remains unchanged.**
