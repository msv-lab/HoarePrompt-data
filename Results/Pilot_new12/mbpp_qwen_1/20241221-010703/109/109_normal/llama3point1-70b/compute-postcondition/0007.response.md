Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists. If `list1` is not empty, the function replaces the last element of `list1` with `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. In both cases, `list2` remains unchanged. After the function executes, `list1` will either end with `list2` if `list1` was not empty, or be equal to `list2` if `list1` was empty. `list2` remains unchanged throughout the function execution.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code and includes the edge case where `list1` is empty, ensuring that all potential cases are accounted for.
