The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` (which is a slice of one element) with the entire `list2`. Let's consider the impact of this operation.

- The last element of `list1` is replaced by `list2`.
- `list1` was initially not empty, meaning it had at least one element before this operation.
- `list2` remains unchanged, but now its contents replace the last element of `list1`.

Since the exact contents of `list1` and `list2` were not specified in the initial state, we can denote the updated state as follows:

- `list1` now ends with `list2` instead of its original last element.
- `list2` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`list1` now ends with `list2` instead of its original last element; `list2` remains unchanged.**
