Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment suggested that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number, upon closer inspection and considering the annotations, it appears that the function actually calculates the n-th Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, while the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. The annotated version clarifies that after the for loop, `a` is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number and `b` is the (n)-th Fibonacci number, which means the function is returning the wrong sequence. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment is False.
