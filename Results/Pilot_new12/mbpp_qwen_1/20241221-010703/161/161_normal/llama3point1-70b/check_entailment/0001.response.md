Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` correctly and uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number for any positive integer `n`. Since the function works correctly for the base cases and follows the recursive definition of the Lucas sequence, it is correct for all potential cases.
