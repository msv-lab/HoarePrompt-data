Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment assumes that the function correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. However, the annotated version reveals that the function actually calculates the (n)-th Fibonacci number instead of the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, which requires finding the n'th Lucas number. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly calculates the (n)-th Fibonacci number for any non-negative integer `n`, but this is not what the problem description asks for. Hence, the program is incorrect.
