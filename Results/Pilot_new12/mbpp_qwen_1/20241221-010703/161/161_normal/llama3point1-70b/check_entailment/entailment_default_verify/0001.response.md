Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and correctly calculates the (n)-th Fibonacci number for any other non-negative integer `n`, the problem description specifically asks for the n-th Lucas number, not the n-th Fibonacci number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Therefore, the function `func_1` returns the correct values for the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence but fails to generate the correct n-th term of the Lucas sequence for `n > 1`. The output hints confirm this misunderstanding, as they mention that the function returns the (n)-th Fibonacci number instead of the (n)-th Lucas number. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should be assessed as incorrect.
