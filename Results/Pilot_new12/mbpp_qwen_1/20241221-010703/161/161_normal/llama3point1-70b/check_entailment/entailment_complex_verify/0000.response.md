Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the Lucas number sequence as described in the problem statement. Specifically:
- For \( n = 0 \), the function returns 2, which matches the definition of the Lucas sequence.
- For \( n = 1 \), the function returns 1, which also matches the definition.
- For any \( n > 1 \), the function correctly computes the \( n \)-th Lucas number using a loop that updates the values of \( a \) and \( b \) according to the recurrence relation \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \).

The annotations clearly show that the program handles all necessary base cases and iterates correctly to compute the desired Lucas number. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
