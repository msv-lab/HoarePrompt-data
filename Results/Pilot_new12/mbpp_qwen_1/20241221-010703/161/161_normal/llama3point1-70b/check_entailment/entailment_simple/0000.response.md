Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. However, the provided program implements the n'th Fibonacci number instead of the n'th Lucas number. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The given program correctly calculates the n'th Fibonacci number:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- For n > 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

While the base cases match the Lucas numbers for the first two terms, the general formula for generating subsequent terms differs. The program returns the n-th Fibonacci number, not the n-th Lucas number. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
