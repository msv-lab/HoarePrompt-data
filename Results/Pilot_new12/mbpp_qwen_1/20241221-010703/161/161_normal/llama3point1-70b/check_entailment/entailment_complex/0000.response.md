Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually compute the n-th Lucas number as required by the problem description. Instead, it computes the n-th Fibonacci number. The Lucas numbers are defined by the recurrence relation \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\) with initial conditions \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\). However, the given program uses the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci sequence but with different initial conditions. Specifically, it returns 2 for \(L(0)\) and 1 for \(L(1)\), which are the same as the Fibonacci sequence's initial conditions, leading to the correct computation of Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers.

To correct this, the program should initialize `a` and `b` to 2 and 1 respectively, as these are the initial conditions for the Lucas sequence. The corrected code would look like:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    else:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
            return b
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the n-th Lucas number as per the problem description.
