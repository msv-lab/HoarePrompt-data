Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number, but based on the problem description, it is supposed to return the n-th Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas numbers start with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. The code correctly implements the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, but this is not the same as the Lucas numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
