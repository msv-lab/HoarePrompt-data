Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the Lucas number sequence. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The program initializes the first two Lucas numbers and then iterates from 2 to n, updating the values of a and b according to the definition. This ensures that the function returns the correct Lucas number for any non-negative integer n. Since the implementation matches the definition and handles all base cases and recursive steps correctly, the program is correct.
