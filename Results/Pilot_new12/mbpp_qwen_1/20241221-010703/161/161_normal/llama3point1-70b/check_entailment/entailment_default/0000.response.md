Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the n-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\) with initial values \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\). However, the code incorrectly computes the Fibonacci sequence, which is defined as \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\) with initial values \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F(1) = 1\).

For example, the first few terms of the Lucas sequence are:
- \(L(0) = 2\)
- \(L(1) = 1\)
- \(L(2) = 3\)
- \(L(3) = 4\)
- \(L(4) = 7\)

However, the provided code will compute:
- \(F(0) = 0\)
- \(F(1) = 1\)
- \(F(2) = 1\)
- \(F(3) = 2\)
- \(F(4) = 3\)

Since the code does not meet the requirements of finding the n-th Lucas number for every potential case, the correctness is **False**.
