Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(2, n + 1):` means the loop will iterate from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). For this loop to execute, the value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is not equal to 0.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 1.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - From the current state, we know that `n` is not 0 and not 1, but we need to confirm that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Since `n` is explicitly stated as a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, it must be at least 2.

4. **Final State Description**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `a` and `b` are already given and do not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
