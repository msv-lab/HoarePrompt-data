`a` and `b` are assigned the values `2` and `1` respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
