The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and assigns `a + b` to `b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. After the assignment, `a` will become 4, and `b` will become `a + b`, which is `3 + 4` or 7. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `a` is 4; `b` is 7**
