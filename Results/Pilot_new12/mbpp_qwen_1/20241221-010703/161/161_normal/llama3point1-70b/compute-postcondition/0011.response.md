According to the code, the loop runs for values of the range starting from 2 up to but not including `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the condition for the loop to continue depends on the value of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `a` is 3
- `b` is 4

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, but since the loop has already started, we need to consider the next possible value of `n` that would allow the loop to continue.

Since the loop has already run for at least one iteration (from 2 to some value less than `n`), the smallest possible value for `n` that would allow the loop to continue is 4 (as it must be greater than or equal to 3).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `a` remains 3
- `b` remains 4

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
