The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After executing the code:

- `a` will take the value of `b`, which is 3.
- `b` will take the value of `a + b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
