The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and updates `a` to be the sum of the original values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is 2 and `b` is 1:

- Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1.
- After executing `a, b = b, a + b`, `a` is updated to `b` (which is 1), and `b` is updated to `a + b` (which is 2 + 1 = 3).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
