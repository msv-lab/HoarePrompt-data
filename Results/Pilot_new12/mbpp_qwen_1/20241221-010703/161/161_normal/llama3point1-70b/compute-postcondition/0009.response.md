According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs from 2 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since it starts at 2 and increments up to `n`). Therefore, the new state should reflect this updated requirement for `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
