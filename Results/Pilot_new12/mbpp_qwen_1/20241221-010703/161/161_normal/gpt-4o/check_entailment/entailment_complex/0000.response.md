Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The problem description asks for a function that finds the n-th Lucas number, but the provided implementation actually computes the n-th term of a specific Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. This sequence matches the definition of the Lucas numbers, which start with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1. 

The function handles the base cases correctly:
- When `n` is 0, it returns 2.
- When `n` is 1, it returns 1.

For any other non-negative integer `n`, the function uses a loop to compute the n-th term of the sequence starting with 2 and 1, which aligns with the definition of the Lucas numbers. The loop correctly updates the values of `a` and `b` to represent the sequence terms, and it returns `b` at the end, which is the n-th term of the sequence.

Since the function correctly implements the logic for finding the n-th term of the Lucas sequence as per the problem description, the program is correct.
