Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the correctness is **False** because the provided function `func_1` calculates the n'th Lucas number correctly for the given test cases, but it should be noted that the Lucas sequence is defined such that \(L(0) = 2\), \(L(1) = 1\), and \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\) for \(n > 1\). However, upon closer inspection of the annotated version, it is clear that the function indeed implements the Lucas sequence correctly. The annotations show that for \(n = 0\) it returns 2, and for \(n = 1\) it returns 1, which aligns with the definition of the Lucas sequence. Additionally, the loop correctly computes the subsequent terms of the sequence using the formula \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\). Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function is correctly implementing the Lucas sequence and thus the original assessment of **False** is inaccurate. The final assessment is **True**.
