Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas number sequence as described. It handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` appropriately and uses a loop to compute the n-th term of the Lucas sequence for any other non-negative integer `n`. The test cases provided also match the expected outputs for the given inputs, confirming that the function works as intended for the specified cases. Since the function correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is True.
