Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the n-th Lucas number. The problem description asks for a function that finds the n-th Lucas number, and the code handles the base cases \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) correctly, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For \( n > 1 \), the code uses a loop to compute the n-th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, which matches the definition of the Lucas sequence. The output hints confirm this behavior and no potential cases are identified where the code fails to meet the requirements.
