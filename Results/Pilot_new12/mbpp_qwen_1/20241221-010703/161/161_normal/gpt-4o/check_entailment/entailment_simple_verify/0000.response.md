Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program attempts to calculate the n-th Lucas number using a loop to iteratively update the values of `a` and `b`. However, the annotation indicates that the loop updates `a` and `b` incorrectly. Specifically, the line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` should be `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` to correctly reflect the Lucas number sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. The current implementation incorrectly sets `b` to the sum of the previous values and then uses `b` for the next iteration without updating `a`. 

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the Lucas number sequence. The annotations confirm the issue with the loop logic, which means the program does not meet the problem description of finding the n-th Lucas number.
