You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n-th Lucas number correctly for the given test cases. However, the program has a logical error in the loop where it updates the values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` should update `a` to the previous value of `b` and `b` to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. Instead, the current implementation incorrectly sets `b` to the sum of the previous values and then uses `b` for the next iteration without updating `a`.

To fix this, the loop should be updated as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This corrected version ensures that `a` and `b` are updated correctly, and the function will work for all potential cases as described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is the \((n+1)\)-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1; `b` is the \(n\)-th term of the same Fibonacci sequence; `i` is `n`.
            return b
            #`The program returns b, which is the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns either 2, 1, or the n-th term of a specific Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1. Specifically:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- For any other non-negative integer `n`, the function computes the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence where the sequence starts with 2 and 1, and returns this value.

The function correctly handles the base cases (`n = 0` and `n = 1`) and uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci sequence for larger values of `n`. After the loop completes, the function returns the correct n-th term of the specified Fibonacci sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
