Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The problem description requires a function that finds the n-th Lucas number, and the annotated program accomplishes this by using a well-defined algorithm.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - When `n == 0`, the function returns `2`, which is the 0th Lucas number.
   - When `n == 1`, the function returns `1`, which is the 1st Lucas number.
   
2. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to calculate the n-th Lucas number using the recurrence relation of the Lucas sequence: \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\), where \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\).
   - The variables `a` and `b` are initialized as `2` and `1`, respectively. In each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes the previous value of `b` and `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `b`, which is the n-th Lucas number.

The provided test cases (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(3) == 4`) match the expected Lucas numbers for those indices (Lucas sequence starts as: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ...).

Since the program follows the problem description and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
