Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n-th Lucas number correctly for the given test cases. However, the program has a logical error in the loop where it updates the values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` should update `a` to the previous value of `b` and `b` to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. Instead, the current implementation incorrectly sets `b` to the sum of the previous values and then uses `b` for the next iteration without updating `a`.

To fix this, the loop should be updated as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This corrected version ensures that `a` and `b` are updated correctly, and the function will work for all potential cases as described.
