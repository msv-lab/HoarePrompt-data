Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the annotated version provides a detailed state analysis of the program, it confirms that there is indeed a logical error in the function as originally assessed. The annotation states that after the for loop, `a` is the \((n+1)\)-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1, and `b` is the \(n\)-th term of the same sequence. However, this is incorrect because the loop should be updating `a` to the previous value of `b` and `b` to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, not just setting `b` to `a + b`. The original assessment correctly identified this issue, and the annotated version further confirms it. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number, hence the final assessment remains **False**.
