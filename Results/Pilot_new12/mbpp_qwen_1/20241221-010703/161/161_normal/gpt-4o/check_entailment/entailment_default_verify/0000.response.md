Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that there is a logical error in the loop where the values of `a` and `b` are being updated incorrectly. The output hints also confirm that the function should compute the n-th term of a specific Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, but the current implementation does not correctly update these values. Specifically, the line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` should be corrected to `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` to ensure that `a` is updated to the previous value of `b` and `b` is updated to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. Since the provided code does not perform this update correctly, the original assessment is accurate.
