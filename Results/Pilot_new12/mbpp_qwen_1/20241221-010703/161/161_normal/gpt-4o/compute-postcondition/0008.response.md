The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. After the assignment, `a` takes the current value of `b`, which is 1, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and n is not equal to 1, but must be greater than or equal to 2; `a` is 1; `b` is 3**
