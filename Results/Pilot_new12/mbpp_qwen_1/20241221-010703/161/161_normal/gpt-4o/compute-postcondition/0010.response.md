The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After executing the code:

- `b` is reassigned to its original value, which is 3.
- `a` is reassigned to the sum of the original `b` and `a`, which is `3 + 1 = 4`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 4; `b` is 3**
