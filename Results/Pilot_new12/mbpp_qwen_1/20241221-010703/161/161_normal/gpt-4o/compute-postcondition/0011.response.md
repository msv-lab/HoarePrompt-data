According to the code, the loop runs from 2 to \( n \) (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 4; `b` is 3.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as the current value of the loop variable (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each time) is less than or equal to \( n \).
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: Let's denote the current value of the loop variable as `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the last value it had before incrementing. Since the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

Given that the loop starts from 2 and goes up to \( n \), if the loop just finished its previous iteration, then the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration would be \( n - 1 \).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to \( n \) (since \( i = n - 1 \) at the end of the previous iteration).
- The condition for the next iteration will check if \( n \) is still within the bounds of the loop, i.e., \( 2 \leq n \leq n \), which simplifies to \( 2 \leq n \).

Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3, and given that the loop just finished, \( n \) must still satisfy these conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `n`, but `i` will now be \( n \).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 4; `b` is 3; `i` is `n`**
