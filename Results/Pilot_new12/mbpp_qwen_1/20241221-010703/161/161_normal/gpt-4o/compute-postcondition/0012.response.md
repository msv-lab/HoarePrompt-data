The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and also updates `a` to the sum of its original value and `b`. Given the initial values:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is 4.
- `b` is 3.
- `i` is `n`.

After executing the line `a, b = b, a + b`:
- `a` will be updated to `b` which is 3.
- `b` will be updated to `a + b` which is `4 + 3 = 7`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was set before the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 3; `b` is 7; `i` is `n`.**
