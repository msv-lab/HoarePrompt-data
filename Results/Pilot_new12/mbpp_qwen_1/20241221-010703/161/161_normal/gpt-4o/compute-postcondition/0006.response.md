The code assigns the value 2 to `a` and the value 1 to `b`. The initial value of `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated, but the conditions regarding `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
