According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it is greater than or equal to 2. The value of `a` is 1, and `b` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged since the loop body is omitted and does not modify these variables.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and it must be greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 1; `b` is 3**
