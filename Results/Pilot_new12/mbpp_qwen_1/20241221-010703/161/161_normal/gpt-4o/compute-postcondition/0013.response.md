Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 1.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```

### Observations from the First Few Iterations:

#### After 1 iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1, but must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is 1.
- `b` is 3.

#### After 2 iterations:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is 4.
- `b` is 3.

### Understanding the Loop:
The loop iterates from `2` to `n+1`, which means it will execute `n - 1` times. Each iteration updates the values of `a` and `b` according to the Fibonacci sequence formula:
- `a` becomes the previous `b`.
- `b` becomes the sum of the previous `a` and `b`.

### Final Values:
- Initially, `a = 2` and `b = 1`.
- After `n-1` iterations, `a` and `b` will follow the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 3rd term (since the loop starts from `2`).

Given the initial values and the number of iterations, we can deduce the final values of `a` and `b`:
- The `k`-th term of the Fibonacci sequence can be calculated as follows:
  - `F(0) = 0`
  - `F(1) = 1`
  - `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k > 1`

Since the loop starts from `2`, the sequence we need is shifted by 2 terms:
- `F(2) = 1`
- `F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `F(4) = 1 + 2 = 3`
- `F(5) = 2 + 3 = 5`
- And so on...

After `n-1` iterations, the value of `a` will be the `(n+1)`-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from the initial values `2` and `1`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `a` will be the `(n+1)`-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from `2` and `1`.
- `b` will be the `n`-th term of the same Fibonacci sequence.
- `i` will be `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is the \((n+1)\)-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1; `b` is the \(n\)-th term of the same Fibonacci sequence; `i` is `n`.**
