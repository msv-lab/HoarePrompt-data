Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts it in non-decreasing order. It achieves this by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the current subarray and moving it to the end of that subarray. Specifically, the function iterates over the array from the largest possible subarray to the smallest (from the entire array down to individual elements), finding the index of the maximum element in each subarray. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the current subarray, it swaps it to the end. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the original array in place; instead, it returns a new sorted array. Potential edge cases include an empty array or an array with one element, both of which are handled correctly as they do not require any sorting operations. However, the annotation suggesting that the array is reversed twice (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` and `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`) is incorrect; only the second reversal is necessary.**
