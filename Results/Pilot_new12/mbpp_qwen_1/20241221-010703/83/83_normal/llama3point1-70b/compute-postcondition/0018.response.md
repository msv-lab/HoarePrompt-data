Postcondition: **`max_index` is reassigned to the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size-2]`, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` still maintain the same relative order among themselves but in reverse positions; the rest of `arr[:n-2]` remains reversed, and the rest of the array remains unchanged. If `max_index` is not 0, then the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, and the rest of the array remains in its original reversed order from `max_index + 1` to `n-2`. If `max_index` is 0, the array remains unchanged.**
