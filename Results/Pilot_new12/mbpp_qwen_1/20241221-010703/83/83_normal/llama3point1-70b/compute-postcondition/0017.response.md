The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements of the array `arr`. Given the initial state, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` will be reversed, but the rest of the array remains unchanged.

Let's denote the initial state of `arr` as follows:
- `arr[:max_index + 1]` is the subarray up to and including `max_index`.
- The first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed.
- The rest of the array remains in its original reversed order from `max_index + 1` to `n-2`.

After executing the code, the subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]` will be reversed. 

Output State: **`arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, and the rest of the array remains in its original reversed order from `max_index + 1` to `n-2`.**
