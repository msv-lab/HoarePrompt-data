Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]`, and it is not equal to `size - 1`.
   - `arr[:size]` is reversed.
   - If `max_index` is equal to `size - 1`, the array remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `size` in the range from `n` down to 1. This means `size` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `size` must be `n - 1` (since `size` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration).

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `size` is decreased by 1, the new value of `size` will be `n - 1`.
   - The condition for `max_index` remains the same: it is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]` and is not equal to `size - 1`.
   - `arr[:size]` will be reversed again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, and it is not equal to `n - 2`.
- `arr[:n-1]` is reversed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, and it is not equal to `n - 2`. After executing the program fragment, `arr[:n-1]` is reversed.**
