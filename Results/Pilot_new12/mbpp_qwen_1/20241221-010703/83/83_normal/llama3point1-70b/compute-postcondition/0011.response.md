The code reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr`. Given that `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]` and is not equal to `n - 2`, and `arr[:n-1]` is reversed, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` before the reversal would have been the last `max_index + 1` elements of the original `arr[:n-1]`.

After the reversal, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` will now be in descending order based on their original values.

Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]` and it is not equal to `n - 2`; `arr[:n-1]` is reversed and the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are now in descending order based on their original values.**
