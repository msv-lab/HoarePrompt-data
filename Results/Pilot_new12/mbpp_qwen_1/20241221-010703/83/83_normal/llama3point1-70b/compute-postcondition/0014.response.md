Postcondition: ***`max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, and it is not equal to `size - 1`. The first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` still maintain the same relative order among themselves but in reverse positions; the rest of `arr[:n-1]` remains reversed, and the rest of the array remains unchanged.***
