Postcondition: ***`max_index` is reassigned to the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size-2]`, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` still maintain the same relative order among themselves but in reverse positions, and the rest of `arr[:n-2]` remains reversed. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the rest of the array remains in its reversed order from `size` to the end; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged as the array was already in the specified state.***
