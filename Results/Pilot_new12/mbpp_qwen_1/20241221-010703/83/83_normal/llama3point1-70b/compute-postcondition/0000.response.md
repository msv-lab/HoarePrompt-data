The code `n = len(arr)` calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state is that `arr` is a list of comparable elements. After executing this line of code, the value of `arr` remains unchanged, but `n` is now the length of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is the length of `arr`**
