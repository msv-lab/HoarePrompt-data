Initially, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, and it is not equal to `n - 2`. The code `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]` (which is equivalent to `arr[:n-1]` from the initial state) and assigns this index to `max_index`.

Since `max_index` was already the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, the value of `max_index` does not change. However, `arr[:n-1]` is reversed, which affects the positions of the elements in the list.

Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`, and it is not equal to `n - 2`; `arr[:n-1]` is reversed.**
