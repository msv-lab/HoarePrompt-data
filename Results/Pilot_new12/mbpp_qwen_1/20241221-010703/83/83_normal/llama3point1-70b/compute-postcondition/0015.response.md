Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-1]`.
   - `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`.
   - The first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` maintain the same relative order among themselves but are in reverse positions.
   - The rest of `arr[:n-1]` remains reversed.
   - The rest of the array remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs over `range(n, 0, -1)`, which means it starts from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `size` was decremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to run as long as `size` is greater than 0.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is running in reverse from `n` to 1, the new value of `size` will be `n - 1`.
   - The `max_index` does not change during the loop execution unless explicitly modified inside the loop, which is not mentioned here.
   - The state of `arr` changes based on the value of `size`:
     - For `size = n - 1`, the last element of the subarray `arr[:n-1]` (which is `arr[n-2]`) will no longer be considered in the reversed part because we are decrementing `size` by 1 each time.
     - Therefore, the rest of `arr[:n-2]` will remain reversed, and the first `max_index + 1` elements will maintain their relative order among themselves but be in reverse positions.

5. **New State**:
   - `max_index` remains the same.
   - The first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` still maintain the same relative order among themselves but are in reverse positions.
   - The rest of `arr[:n-2]` remains reversed.
   - The rest of the array remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n-2]`, and it is not equal to `size - 1`. The first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` still maintain the same relative order among themselves but in reverse positions; the rest of `arr[:n-2]` remains reversed, and the rest of the array remains unchanged.**
