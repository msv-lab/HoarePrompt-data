The code reverses the slice of the list `arr` from the start up to and including the index `max_index`. Since `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the slice being reversed does not include the last element of the list. The value of `max_index` is not 0, so the slice includes at least one element.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `arr[:max_index + 1]` is the slice of the list `arr` from the start up to and including `max_index`.
- After reversing this slice, the elements in this slice will be in reverse order.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `max_index` are not given, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]` and is not equal to `size - 1`, and `max_index` is not 0.**
