Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm described in the problem description. Specifically, the line `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` is unnecessary and incorrect. According to the output hints, only the second reversal `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` is necessary. The first reversal moves the maximum element to its correct position, but then immediately reversing the subarray up to `max_index + 1` again disrupts the order. This extra reversal causes the sorting algorithm to produce incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
