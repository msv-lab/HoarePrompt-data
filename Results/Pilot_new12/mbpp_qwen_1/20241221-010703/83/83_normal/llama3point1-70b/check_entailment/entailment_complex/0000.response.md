Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description asks to sort a list of elements in non-decreasing order. However, the provided code snippet actually performs a series of reversals that do not result in a sorted list. Instead of sorting the list, the code reverses segments of the list multiple times, which leads to incorrect results.

Specifically, the line `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses a segment of the array up to and including the maximum element's index, and the line `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the entire current subarray. Reversing these segments twice (as the comment suggests) does not lead to a sorted list but rather results in an incorrectly ordered list.

To achieve the correct sorting behavior, a different algorithm should be used, such as the bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort, which explicitly arrange elements in non-decreasing order. The current implementation does not accomplish this goal.
