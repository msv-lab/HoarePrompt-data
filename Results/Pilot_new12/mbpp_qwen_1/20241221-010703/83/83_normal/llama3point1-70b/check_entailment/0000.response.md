Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Specifically, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The intention seems to be to sort the array by repeatedly moving the maximum element to its correct position, but the implementation does not achieve this correctly. For instance, consider the input `[3, 2, 4, 1]`. The first iteration sets `size` to 4, finds the maximum index as 2 (for the value 4), and then performs swaps which do not correctly place the maximum element. The program should use a proper sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort, but the current implementation does not sort the array correctly for all possible inputs.
