You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort the array using a custom algorithm, but it does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Specifically, the logic used to reverse parts of the array does not ensure that the array is sorted in ascending order.

For example, consider the input `[3, 2, 1]`:
- In the first iteration, `size` starts at 3 and `max_index` will be 0 because `arr[0]` is the maximum value.
- The array is reversed from index 0 to 0, which doesn't change anything.
- In the second iteration, `size` is 2, and `max_index` will be 1 because `arr[1]` is the maximum value.
- The array is reversed from index 0 to 1, resulting in `[2, 3, 1]`.
- In the third iteration, `size` is 1, and `max_index` will be 1 (which is equal to `size - 1`), so no action is taken.

The output is `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted. Therefore, the program does not correctly sort the list for this input.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts it in non-decreasing order. It achieves this by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the current subarray and moving it to the end of that subarray. Specifically, the function iterates over the array from the largest possible subarray to the smallest (from the entire array down to individual elements), finding the index of the maximum element in each subarray. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the current subarray, it swaps it to the end. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the original array in place; instead, it returns a new sorted array. Potential edge cases include an empty array or an array with one element, both of which are handled correctly as they do not require any sorting operations. However, the annotation suggesting that the array is reversed twice (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` and `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`) is incorrect; only the second reversal is necessary.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
