Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm. The function `func_1` attempts to sort the array by moving the maximum element of the current subarray to its correct position, but it does so by reversing parts of the array, which is not an efficient or correct way to sort. The issue lies in the double reversal of the subarray, which results in the subarray being partially or fully reversed multiple times, leading to incorrect ordering. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`. The first iteration would move `9` to the end, resulting in `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 9]`. The second iteration would move `6` to the end, but the previous reversal affects the order, leading to incorrect sorting. This approach does not guarantee that the array will be sorted correctly for all cases.
