Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort the array using a custom algorithm, but it does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Specifically, the logic used to reverse parts of the array does not ensure that the array is sorted in ascending order.

For example, consider the input `[3, 2, 1]`:
- In the first iteration, `size` starts at 3 and `max_index` will be 0 because `arr[0]` is the maximum value.
- The array is reversed from index 0 to 0, which doesn't change anything.
- In the second iteration, `size` is 2, and `max_index` will be 1 because `arr[1]` is the maximum value.
- The array is reversed from index 0 to 1, resulting in `[2, 3, 1]`.
- In the third iteration, `size` is 1, and `max_index` will be 1 (which is equal to `size - 1`), so no action is taken.

The output is `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted. Therefore, the program does not correctly sort the list for this input.
