Functionality: **The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `arr` to find the index of the maximum element. If the loop executes at least once, it returns the index of the maximum element. If the loop does not execute (i.e., the list is empty or `n` is 1), it returns 0. An edge case to consider is when `n` is 0, in which case the function should return 0 immediately without entering the loop. Additionally, the function assumes that `arr` has at least `n` elements, which might not always be true; thus, the function should handle this case by checking the length of `arr` against `n` before proceeding with the loop.**
