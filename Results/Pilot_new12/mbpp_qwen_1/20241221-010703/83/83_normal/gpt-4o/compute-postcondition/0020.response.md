Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and returns the same list sorted in descending order. It achieves this by iterating over the list from the end to the beginning, finding the index of the maximum element in the current subarray, and swapping it with the last element of the subarray. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in descending order. The function handles the case where the maximum element is already in its correct position, avoiding unnecessary swaps. However, it does not handle the case where the input list is already sorted in descending order, as no changes would be made in such a scenario.**
