The code initializes `max_index` to 0. This does not affect any existing values in the list `arr` or the integer `n`. The output state will retain the initial conditions of the variables.

Output State: **arr is a list of comparable elements, n is an integer representing the length of the list such that 0 < n <= len(arr), and max_index is 0.**
