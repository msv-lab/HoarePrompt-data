According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1, and `arr` must have at least `n` elements. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `arr` must have at least `n` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `arr` must still have at least `n` elements.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `arr` must still have at least `n` elements.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `arr` must have at least `n` elements**
