Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of comparable elements. If `max_index` is not equal to `n - 1`, the sublist from index 0 to `n - 1` in `arr` is reversed, where `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n-1` elements of `arr` and `n` remains greater than or equal to 2. If `max_index` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made to the sublist from index 0 to `n - 1` in `arr`.***
