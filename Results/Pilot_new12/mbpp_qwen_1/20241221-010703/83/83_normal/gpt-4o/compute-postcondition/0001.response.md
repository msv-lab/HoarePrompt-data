Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list, such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(arr)}\).
- `max_index` is initially set to 0.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` (since `range(1, n)` generates values from 1 to `n-1`).

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop should continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **List `arr`:**
   - The list `arr` must have at least `n` elements because `n` is the upper limit for the loop.

4. **Variable `max_index`:**
   - The value of `max_index` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but may be used inside the loop. It is initialized to 0, but this doesn't affect the loop's starting condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` starts at 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The list `arr` must have at least `n` elements.

### State after adjustment:
State: **`total` is not specified (not relevant here), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `arr` must have at least `n` elements**
