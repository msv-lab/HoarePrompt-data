Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements; `n` is the length of `arr`; the list `arr` is sorted in descending order.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution Analysis**:
  - The loop iterates over `curr_size` starting from `n` down to 2.
  - For each `curr_size`, it finds the `max_index` of the largest element in the sublist from `0` to `curr_size - 1`.
  - If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, it swaps the element at `max_index` with the element at `curr_size - 1`.

- **Understanding the Effect of Each Iteration**:
  - In each iteration, the largest element in the current sublist is moved to its correct position (i.e., the end of the sublist).
  - After the loop completes, the largest element will be at the end of the sublist, and this process continues until the entire list is sorted in descending order.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `arr` will be fully sorted in descending order.
  - The variable `n` will still hold the original length of the list, as it is not modified within the loop.
  - The variable `max_index` will hold the index of the largest element in the current sublist during each iteration, but its final value will not affect the final sorted list.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the list `arr` will be sorted in descending order, with `n` retaining its original value and `max_index` being irrelevant to the final state of the list.
