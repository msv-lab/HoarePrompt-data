`max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `max_index` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `max_index` is 2**
