You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of comparable elements; `n` is the length of `arr`; the list `arr` is sorted in descending order.
    return arr
    #`arr` which is a list of comparable elements sorted in descending order

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and end is an integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr), indicating the end index of the sublist to be flipped.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is 0, and every pair of elements that were originally at indices `(i, len(arr) - 1 - i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `start - 1` have been swapped.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements, and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that 0 < n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` if the loop executes at least once. Otherwise, `max_index` remains 0.
    return max_index
    #`The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in list 'arr' if the loop executes at least once. Otherwise, max_index remains 0.`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
