You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and returns the same list sorted in descending order. It achieves this by iterating over the list from the end to the beginning, finding the index of the maximum element in the current subarray, and swapping it with the last element of the subarray. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in descending order. The function handles the case where the maximum element is already in its correct position, avoiding unnecessary swaps. However, it does not handle the case where the input list is already sorted in descending order, as no changes would be made in such a scenario.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip` takes an integer `end` as a parameter, where `0 <= end < len(arr)`, and reverses the sublist of the list `arr` from index `0` to `end` inclusive. After executing the function, the elements in `arr` from index `0` to `end` will be in reverse order, with the element originally at index `0` now at index `end`, and the element originally at index `end` now at index `0`. If `end` is `0`, the function does nothing since there are no elements to flip. The function also ensures that after the flip operation, the value of `start` becomes equal to `end + 1`, and `end` becomes `0`, indicating that the entire sublist has been processed.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `arr` to find the index of the maximum element. If the loop executes at least once, it returns the index of the maximum element. If the loop does not execute (i.e., the list is empty or `n` is 1), it returns 0. An edge case to consider is when `n` is 0, in which case the function should return 0 immediately without entering the loop. Additionally, the function assumes that `arr` has at least `n` elements, which might not always be true; thus, the function should handle this case by checking the length of `arr` against `n` before proceeding with the loop.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
