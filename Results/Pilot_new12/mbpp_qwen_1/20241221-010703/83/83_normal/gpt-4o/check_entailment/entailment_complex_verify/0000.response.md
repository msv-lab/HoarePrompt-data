Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description of sorting a list in ascending order. The annotated version confirms that `func_1` sorts the array in descending order instead of ascending order. Although the annotations mention that the function handles the case where the maximum element is already in its correct position, they do not address the fundamental issue that the array is sorted in descending order rather than ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of sorting the list in ascending order as specified in the problem description.
