Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to sort the array by finding the maximum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the last unsorted element, but this approach does not guarantee a sorted array. The annotations suggest that the array is sorted in descending order, which is not a correct interpretation of a fully sorted array. A fully sorted array should be in ascending order. The provided test cases only verify that the maximum element is moved to the end, but they do not ensure that the rest of the array is correctly sorted. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description of sorting a list of elements in ascending order.
