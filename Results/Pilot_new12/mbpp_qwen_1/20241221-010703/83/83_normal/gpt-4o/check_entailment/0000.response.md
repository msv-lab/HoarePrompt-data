Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. The `func_1` function attempts to sort the array by finding the maximum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the last unsorted element, but this approach does not guarantee a sorted array. For example, consider the input `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`. After the first iteration of the outer loop, the maximum element in the first two elements is found, but it is not swapped with the last element of the current unsorted portion, leading to incorrect ordering. Additionally, the flipping operations are not performed correctly; the second call to `flip` should not be called if no swap was made in the first call. This results in an incorrect final sorted order.
