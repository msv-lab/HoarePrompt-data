Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly sort the list. The `func_1` function attempts to sort the list by finding the maximum element and flipping it to the end, but this approach only partially sorts the list. Specifically, after each iteration of the outer loop, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position, but the inner structure of the remaining unsorted portion is not properly maintained.

For example, consider the list `[3, 2, 1]`. The function will first find the maximum index (which is 0 for the first iteration) and swap it with the last element, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. However, since the list is already sorted, no further flips are needed. But the provided implementation does not stop after sorting the list; it continues to iterate over the entire list unnecessarily.

To verify, let's test the provided functions with the list `[3, 2, 1]`:

```python
arr = [3, 2, 1]
sorted_arr = func_1(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

The output will be `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct, but the code still performs unnecessary operations. To fully validate, consider another list, such as `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`. The function should sort this list to `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`.

However, due to the nature of the algorithm, it does not guarantee that the list will be fully sorted in all cases without additional checks or modifications. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
