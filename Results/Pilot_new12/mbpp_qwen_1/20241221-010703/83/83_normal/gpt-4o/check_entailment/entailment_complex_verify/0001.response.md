Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program does not fully meet the problem description. While the provided code sorts the list in descending order, it does not perform a standard ascending sort as required by the problem description. The functions `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index` are designed to sort the list in descending order, not ascending order. 

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not meet the requirement to sort the list in ascending order. The provided assertions in the annotated code confirm that the program sorts the list in descending order, which is not the desired behavior. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the given problem description.
