Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm as per the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to sort a list of elements in ascending order. However, the implementation in `func_1` sorts the list in descending order instead. 

To verify this, let's examine the key components:

1. **Sorting Order**: The problem description requires the function to sort the list in ascending order. However, `func_1` sorts the list in descending order because it uses the results from `find_max_index` and `flip` to place the largest element at the end of the current subarray in each iteration of the outer loop. This is evident from the following code snippet:
   ```python
   max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
   
   if max_index != curr_size - 1:
       flip(max_index)
       flip(curr_size - 1)
   ```
   Here, `max_index` finds the index of the maximum element, and `flip` swaps this element with the last element of the current subarray. This process effectively sorts the array in descending order.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program also confirm that the function is sorting in descending order:
   ```python
   assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
   assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
   assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]
   ```

Since the function sorts the list in descending order rather than ascending order, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
