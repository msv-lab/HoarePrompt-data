Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to sort a list in descending order, but the implementation only handles the case where the maximum element in the current subarray is not already in its correct position. This means that if the input list is already sorted in descending order, the function will not make any changes, leaving the list unsorted, which violates the requirement that the function should sort the list for every potential case. Additionally, the code assumes that the `find_max_index` function will always have enough elements to iterate over, but it does not handle the case where `n` is 0, which is an edge case that should be considered.
