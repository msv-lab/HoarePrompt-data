Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where the input list is already sorted in descending order. According to the problem description, the function should sort the list in descending order. However, the provided implementation does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the `func_1` function relies on the `find_max_index` function to find the maximum element in the current subarray and swap it with the last element. If the list is already sorted in descending order, `find_max_index` will not find any new maximums to swap, resulting in no changes being made to the list.

To demonstrate this, consider the following input:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, the input list is already sorted in descending order, but the function does not perform any swaps and returns the same list, which is not sorted in descending order. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the program incorrect.
