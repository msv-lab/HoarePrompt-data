Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is already sorted in descending order. The `func_1` function is designed to sort the list in descending order by repeatedly finding the maximum element and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted portion of the list. However, if the list is already sorted in descending order, no changes will be made, and the function will return the original list. This does not meet the problem description, which requires the function to sort the list in descending order for any given input. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
