Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` returns a tuple where the i-th element is the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple` function to create a new tuple with these products, iterating from the start of the input tuple up to the second-to-last element. This ensures that the resulting tuple has a length of `N`, as required.

Based on the provided assertions, the function works correctly for tuples of varying lengths and values. The code handles the minimum length requirement of 2 elements in the input tuple and produces the expected output. No edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided examples. Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.
