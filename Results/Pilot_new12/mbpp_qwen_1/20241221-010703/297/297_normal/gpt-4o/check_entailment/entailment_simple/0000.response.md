Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

- It takes a tuple `t` of numbers as input.
- It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`.

Let's break down the function:

```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
```

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes the input `t` is a tuple of numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The input validation part is implicit and assumed to be valid based on the problem statement.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop `for i in range(len(t) - 1)` iterates through the indices of the tuple up to the second last element, ensuring that `t[i + 1]` is always a valid index.

3. **Product Calculation**: For each index `i`, the product `t[i] * t[i + 1]` is calculated, and these products are collected into a new tuple.

4. **Output**: The resulting tuple of products is returned.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

- `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`
- `func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))` returns `(8, 20, 30, 42)`
- `func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15))` returns `(156, 182, 126, 135)`
- `func_1((12,))` returns `()` (an empty tuple, as there are no pairs of consecutive elements to multiply).

Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all given test cases and scenarios, the program is correct.
