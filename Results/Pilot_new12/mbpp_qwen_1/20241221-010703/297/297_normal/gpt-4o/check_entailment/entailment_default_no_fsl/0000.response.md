Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple. The function correctly uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to achieve this. The assertions provided in the code cover different scenarios including tuples of varying lengths and values, and the function passes all these tests. Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the function appears to handle all relevant cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities identified. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
