Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` according to the problem description. The function takes a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid input, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs like non-tuple or non-numeric elements, which aligns with the given constraints.
   
2. **Range of Iteration**: The function uses `range(len(t) - 1)` to iterate over the tuple `t`, ensuring that it correctly pairs each element with its successor. This guarantees that no element is left out, and the multiplication is performed for all possible consecutive pairs.

3. **Output Format**: The function returns a tuple containing the products of these consecutive pairs, exactly as required by the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases verify that the function works correctly for different inputs, confirming that it produces the expected output.

Since the function `func_1` meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and the provided assertions confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
