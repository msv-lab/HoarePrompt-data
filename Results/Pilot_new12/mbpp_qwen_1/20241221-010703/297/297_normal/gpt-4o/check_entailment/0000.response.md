Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to generate the required output, which is efficient and concise. 

The function handles the edge case of an input tuple with less than two elements correctly by returning an empty tuple, as specified in the examples. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and confirm that the function works as expected for all tested cases. Therefore, no potential case was found where the program does not work as intended based on the problem description.
