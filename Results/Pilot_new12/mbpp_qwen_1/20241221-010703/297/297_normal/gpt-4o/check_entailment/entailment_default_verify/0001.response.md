Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It generates a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including tuples of different lengths and edge cases like a single-element tuple resulting in an empty output. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of at least length 2 and iterates correctly through the tuple to perform the multiplication. No edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided code and test cases. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
