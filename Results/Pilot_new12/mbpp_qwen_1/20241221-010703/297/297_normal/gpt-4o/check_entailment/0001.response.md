Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each input tuple, it generates a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function works correctly for all the provided test cases:

- For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.
- For the input `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output is `(8, 20, 30, 42)`.
- For the input `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)`, the output is `(156, 182, 126, 135)`.
- For the input `(12,)`, the output is `()` (an empty tuple), which is consistent with the requirement since there are no consecutive elements to multiply.

The function handles tuples of varying lengths, including the edge case of a single-element tuple, which results in an empty tuple as per the problem description. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases based on the provided examples.
