#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of N+1, where N is a positive integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple 't'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`. The function correctly handles the case where the input tuple has a minimum length of 2, as it iterates through the tuple up to `len(t) - 1` to ensure there are always two consecutive elements to multiply. No edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided code.
