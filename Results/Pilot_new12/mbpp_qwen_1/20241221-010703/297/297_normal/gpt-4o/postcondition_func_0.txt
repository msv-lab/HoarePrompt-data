The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`. The function correctly handles the case where the input tuple has a minimum length of 2, as it iterates through the tuple up to `len(t) - 1` to ensure there are always two consecutive elements to multiply. No edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided code.
