The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the program returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) with a specific length and return a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a tuple of numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer, and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple `t`.**
