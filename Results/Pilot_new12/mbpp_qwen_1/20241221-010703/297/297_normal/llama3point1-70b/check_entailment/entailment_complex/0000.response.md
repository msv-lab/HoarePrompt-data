Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of the tuple. 

- The function accepts a tuple of integers, which can have a length of at least 2.
- For each element in the returned tuple (except the last one), it multiplies the current element with the next one in the sequence.
- The last element of the returned tuple is the product of the second-to-last element and the last element of the original tuple.
- If the input tuple has only one element, the function would theoretically have no elements to process (since there's no next element to pair with), but in practice, this edge case is not handled due to the nature of the `zip` function, which pairs elements from the beginning up to the shortest input. This means the function gracefully handles tuples of any length greater than 1 without raising an error.
- The function does not explicitly check for tuples with a length of 1 or less, but it naturally handles such cases by not producing any output for the undefined behavior.

Since the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
