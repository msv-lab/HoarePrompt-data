Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function works as intended, generating a tuple of products from the input tuple and its right-shifted version. The original assessment is justified because the function handles all valid inputs as required, producing the correct output for any tuple of at least two elements.
