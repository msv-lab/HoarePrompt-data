Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description perfectly. Given an input tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor.

For example:
- Input: `(1, 2, 3, 4)`
- Output: `(2, 6, 12)` which is correct because \(2 = 1 \times 2\), \(6 = 2 \times 3\), and \(12 = 3 \times 4\).

Since the function handles all provided cases correctly and no edge cases were found that make it fail, the program is correct.
