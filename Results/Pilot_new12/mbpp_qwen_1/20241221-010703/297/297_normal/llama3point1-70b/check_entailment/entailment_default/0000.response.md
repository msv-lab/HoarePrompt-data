Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of the tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the resulting tuple. The generator expression iterates over pairs of elements from the original tuple and the right-shifted version of the tuple using `zip`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the function works as expected for all potential cases. The hints confirm that the function correctly computes the products for adjacent elements in the tuple, including handling the edge cases where the last element is paired with the second-to-last element. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
