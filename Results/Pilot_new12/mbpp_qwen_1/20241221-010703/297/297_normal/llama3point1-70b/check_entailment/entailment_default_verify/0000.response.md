Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the desired output. This approach works for any tuple of at least two elements and handles all potential cases as required by the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, specifically mentioning that the first element of the returned tuple is the product of the last two elements of `numbers`, and the last element of the returned tuple is the product of the second-to-last element and the last element of `numbers`. The original assessment is consistent with the provided code and the output hints.
