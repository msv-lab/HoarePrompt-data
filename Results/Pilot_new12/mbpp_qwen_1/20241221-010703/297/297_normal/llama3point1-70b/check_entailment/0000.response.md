Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the desired output. This approach works for any tuple of at least two elements and handles all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all possible inputs.
