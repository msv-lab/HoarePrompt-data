Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes the input will be a valid tuple of integers of length \(N+1\). The program does not explicitly validate the input type or length, but it implicitly relies on this assumption because it uses operations that are defined for tuples (e.g., `zip()` and slicing).

2. **Functionality**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input.
   - It uses the `zip()` function to pair each element with its subsequent element. For example, if `numbers = (t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, then `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` produces pairs like `(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), ..., (t_N, t_{N+1})`.
   - It then multiplies these paired elements using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor, resulting in a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the original tuple and its right-shifted version.

3. **Output**: The output tuple has exactly \(N\) elements, which matches the requirement of returning a tuple of length \(N\).

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program consistently meets the requirements for any valid input tuple of length \(N+1\). Therefore, the program is correct.
