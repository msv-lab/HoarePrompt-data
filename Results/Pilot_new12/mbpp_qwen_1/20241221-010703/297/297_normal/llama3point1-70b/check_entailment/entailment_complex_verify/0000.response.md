Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, generating a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of the tuple. The function correctly handles tuples of at least two elements, and the annotation accurately describes the behavior for such inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
