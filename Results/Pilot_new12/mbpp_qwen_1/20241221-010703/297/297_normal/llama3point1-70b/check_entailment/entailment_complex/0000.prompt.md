You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of integers of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple `numbers` and its right-shifted version
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of integers called `numbers`, which has a length of at least 2. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original `numbers` tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of `numbers`. Specifically, the first element of the returned tuple is the product of the last two elements of `numbers`, and the last element of the returned tuple is the product of the second-to-last element and the last element of `numbers`. If `numbers` has only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there is no right-shifted element to multiply with.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
