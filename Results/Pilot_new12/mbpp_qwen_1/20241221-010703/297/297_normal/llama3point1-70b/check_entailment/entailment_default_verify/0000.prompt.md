You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the desired output. This approach works for any tuple of at least two elements and handles all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of integers called `numbers`, which has a length of at least 2. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original `numbers` tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of `numbers`. Specifically, the first element of the returned tuple is the product of the last two elements of `numbers`, and the last element of the returned tuple is the product of the second-to-last element and the last element of `numbers`. If `numbers` has only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there is no right-shifted element to multiply with.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
