Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` generates a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple. The use of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` ensures that each element is paired with its subsequent element, covering all cases from the first element to the second last element of the tuple. The last element of the returned tuple is correctly the product of the second-to-last and the last elements of the original tuple. The code handles all described cases without raising unexpected errors under the assumption that the input is valid.
