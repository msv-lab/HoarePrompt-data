Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and the output hints. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected cases correctly, producing the expected results without any issues. Since the function meets the requirements and behaves as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
