The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a tuple of integers with a length of N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. The function returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple `numbers` and its right-shifted version.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of integers `numbers` and return a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from `numbers` and its right-shifted version.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers (a tuple of integers of length N+1), and returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple and its right-shifted version.**
