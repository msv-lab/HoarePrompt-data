The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of integers called `numbers`, which has a length of at least 2. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the original `numbers` tuple and the next element in the right-shifted version of `numbers`. Specifically, the first element of the returned tuple is the product of the last two elements of `numbers`, and the last element of the returned tuple is the product of the second-to-last element and the last element of `numbers`. If `numbers` has only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there is no right-shifted element to multiply with.
