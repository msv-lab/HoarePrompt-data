The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element of any data type `element`. It returns the count of `element` in tuple `tup`. This means the function will return 0 if `element` is not found in `tup`, and a positive integer representing the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. There are no missing functionalities in the given code. However, it's worth noting that the function does not modify the input tuple `tup` in any way; it only performs a read operation to count the occurrences of `element`.
