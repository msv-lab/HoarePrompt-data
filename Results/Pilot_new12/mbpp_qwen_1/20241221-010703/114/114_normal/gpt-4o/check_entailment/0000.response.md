Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. However, the problem description specifies that the function should take a tuple and an element as inputs and count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided function does not meet this requirement because it does not accept the element as a separate argument but rather directly uses the element from the assert statement within the function body. This approach is incorrect as it violates the function signature specified in the problem description.

For example, the first assert statement `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` should ideally call the function with two parameters: a tuple and an element. Instead, the function is being called with a fixed element value inside the assert statement, which is not a valid function call according to the problem description.
