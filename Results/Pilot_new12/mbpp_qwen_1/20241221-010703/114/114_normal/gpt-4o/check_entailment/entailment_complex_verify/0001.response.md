Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The annotations confirm that the function returns the count of `element` in tuple `tup`, and the provided test cases verify that the function works correctly for different scenarios. Since the function behaves as expected and the annotations support this, there is no need to change the original assessment.
