Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple for every potential case. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately returns the number of times an element appears in the tuple. The assertions provided in the problem description also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the function handles all tested cases and the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases that the function should consider, the code is correct.
