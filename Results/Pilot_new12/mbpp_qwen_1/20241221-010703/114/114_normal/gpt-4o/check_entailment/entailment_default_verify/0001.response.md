Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function returns the expected count of the element in the tuple, and the provided assertions validate this behavior. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the implementation logic is appropriate, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or additional inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is justified.
