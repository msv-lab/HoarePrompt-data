Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of the element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The function correctly handles any valid tuple and any valid element (of any data type). The provided assertions also correctly test the function for different cases, ensuring that the implementation is as expected. Since the function performs exactly as described and handles all valid inputs as per the assumption, the program is correct.
