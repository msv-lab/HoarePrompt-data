Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` as per the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. The assertions provided in the program verify that the function works correctly for the given test cases:

- For the input `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `4`, the function returns `0` because `4` is not present in the tuple.
- For the input `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `10`, the function returns `3` because `10` appears three times in the tuple.
- For the input `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `8`, the function returns `4` because `8` appears four times in the tuple.

Since the function `tup.count(element)` handles all cases correctly and the provided assertions confirm its correctness, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
