Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `element` as inputs and returns the count of how many times `element` occurs in `tup`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to achieve this, which is a straightforward and correct approach. Additionally, the function does not modify the input tuple, adhering to the expected behavior. The provided test cases also correctly validate that the function works as intended for different scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
