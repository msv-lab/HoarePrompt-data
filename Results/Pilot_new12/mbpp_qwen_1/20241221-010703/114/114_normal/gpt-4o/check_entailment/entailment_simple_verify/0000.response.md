Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `element`. However, the provided test cases incorrectly use `assert` statements with a fixed element value, which does not reflect the intended usage of the function as described in the problem. The function should be tested with a separate `element` argument, not directly within the `assert` statements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and should be maintained.
