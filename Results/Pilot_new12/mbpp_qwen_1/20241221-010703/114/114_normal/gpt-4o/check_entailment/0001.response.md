Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. The first assertion checks for an element (4) that is not present in the tuple, returning 0.
2. The second assertion checks for an element (10) that appears multiple times in the tuple, returning the correct count of 3.
3. The third assertion checks for an element (8) that also appears multiple times in the tuple, returning the correct count of 4.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the implementation logic is straightforward and appropriate for the problem description, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or additional inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information.
