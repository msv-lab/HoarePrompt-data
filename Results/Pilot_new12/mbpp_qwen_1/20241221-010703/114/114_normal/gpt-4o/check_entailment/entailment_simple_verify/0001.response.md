Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The annotations support this by stating that `tup` is a tuple and `element` can be of any data type, which aligns with the function definition. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:

1. The first assertion checks for an element (4) that is not present in the tuple, returning 0.
2. The second assertion checks for an element (10) that appears multiple times in the tuple, returning the correct count of 3.
3. The third assertion checks for an element (8) that also appears multiple times in the tuple, returning the correct count of 4.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the implementation logic is straightforward and appropriate for the problem description, the program is correct. The annotations do not suggest any issues with the provided code, and there are no edge cases or additional inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as **True**.
