The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`. It returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. The function correctly counts the occurrences of `elem` within `tup` and handles all elements that are hashable. Potential edge cases include an empty tuple (`tup`), where the function returns 0, and when `elem` is not present in `tup`, also resulting in a return value of 0. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
