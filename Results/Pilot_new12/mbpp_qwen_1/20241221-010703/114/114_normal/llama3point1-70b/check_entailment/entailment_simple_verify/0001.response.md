Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The annotation states that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object, which is consistent with the problem description that requires counting occurrences of elements in a tuple. Since the problem description specifies that the input will be a tuple and the element will be hashable, the function meets the requirements without any issues. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
