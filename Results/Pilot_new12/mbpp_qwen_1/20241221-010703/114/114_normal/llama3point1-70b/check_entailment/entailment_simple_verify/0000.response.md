Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method to count the occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The annotation specifies that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object, ensuring that the `count` method will work as expected without raising any errors. Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
