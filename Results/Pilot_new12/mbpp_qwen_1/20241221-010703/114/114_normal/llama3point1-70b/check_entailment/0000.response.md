Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. This method iterates over the tuple and counts how many times the specified element appears, which exactly matches the problem description. Since the function works correctly for any input tuple and any element, there is no potential case where the program does not meet the requirements.
