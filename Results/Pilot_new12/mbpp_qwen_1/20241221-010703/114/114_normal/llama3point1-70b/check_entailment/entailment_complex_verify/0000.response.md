Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The annotations indicate that the function handles edge cases such as an empty tuple, returning 0 in such scenarios. Additionally, the function correctly counts occurrences for any hashable object provided as the second argument. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
