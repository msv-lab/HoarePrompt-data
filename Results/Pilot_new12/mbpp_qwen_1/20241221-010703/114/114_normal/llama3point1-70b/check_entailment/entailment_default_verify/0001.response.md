Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function handles all elements that are hashable and provides expected results for edge cases such as an empty tuple, where it returns 0, and when the element is not present, also resulting in a return value of 0. Since the problem description and the provided code align perfectly, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
