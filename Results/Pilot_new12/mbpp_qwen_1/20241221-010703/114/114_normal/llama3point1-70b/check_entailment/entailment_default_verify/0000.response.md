Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple using Python's built-in `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as an empty tuple, returning 0 in these scenarios. Additionally, the function correctly counts the occurrences of any hashable object within the tuple. Since the problem description specifies that the function should take a tuple and an element and count the occurrences of the element in the tuple, and the provided implementation satisfies this requirement, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
