Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. This method will handle all elements, including those that are not hashable (e.g., lists, dictionaries), but since the problem description only mentions counting occurrences of elements in a tuple, this implementation is appropriate. Given the problem description, there are no potential cases where this function would fail to meet the requirements.
