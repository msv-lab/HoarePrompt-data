Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling all elements that are hashable, including edge cases such as an empty tuple or when the element is not present in the tuple, both of which result in a return value of 0. Since the problem description specifies counting occurrences of elements in a tuple and the provided code meets this requirement, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
