Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element `elem` within the tuple `tup`. The function handles all potential cases, including an empty tuple, where it returns 0 if the element is not present. The code works correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases that the code fails to handle.
