Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to achieve this, which is the correct approach. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases (like handling invalid inputs, which is outside the scope as per the given assumption), the program correctly implements the required functionality.
