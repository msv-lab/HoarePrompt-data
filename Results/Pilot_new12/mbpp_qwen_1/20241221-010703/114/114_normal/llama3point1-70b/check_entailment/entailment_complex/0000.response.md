Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately counts the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. The provided comment also correctly notes that the function handles edge cases such as an empty tuple, where the count would be 0, and when `elem` is not present in `tup`, also resulting in a return value of 0. Since the problem description does not specify additional requirements or constraints beyond counting occurrences, the function is considered correct.
