Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique numbers. The annotated version supports this by explicitly stating that the function returns `None` if there are fewer than two unique numbers, and returns the second smallest integer otherwise. The function correctly handles all described cases, including the edge case where the list might contain fewer than two distinct numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
