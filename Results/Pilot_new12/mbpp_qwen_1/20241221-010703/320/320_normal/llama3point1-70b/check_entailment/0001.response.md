Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring that there are at least two unique numbers before proceeding. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None`. For lists with at least two unique numbers, it sorts the unique numbers and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number. This approach works for all potential cases as long as the list contains at least two distinct numbers. If the list has fewer than two distinct numbers, it handles this edge case appropriately by returning `None`.
