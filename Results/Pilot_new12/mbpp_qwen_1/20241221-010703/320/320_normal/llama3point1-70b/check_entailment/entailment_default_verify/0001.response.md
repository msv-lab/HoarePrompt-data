Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring that there are at least two unique numbers before proceeding. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None`. The output hints confirm that the function aims to find the second smallest unique integer in the input list `nums`, handling cases where duplicates exist and ensuring the input list has at least two unique elements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
