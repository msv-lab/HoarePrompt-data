Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list of integers.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input.
   - It first creates a list of unique numbers from `nums` using `set(nums)`. This ensures all numbers are distinct.
   - If the resulting list `unique_nums` has fewer than two elements, the function returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement that there should be at least two unique elements to find the second smallest number.
   - If `unique_nums` has two or more elements, the function sorts this list and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`).

3. **Validation**:
   - The program handles the case where there are fewer than two unique elements in the list by returning `None`.
   - It correctly finds and returns the second smallest number when there are at least two unique elements.

Given the assumptions about valid input, the program adheres to the problem description in all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
