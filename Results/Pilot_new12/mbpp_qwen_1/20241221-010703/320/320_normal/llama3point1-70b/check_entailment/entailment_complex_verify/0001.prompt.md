You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring that there are at least two unique numbers before proceeding. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None`. For lists with at least two unique numbers, it sorts the unique numbers and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number. This approach works for all potential cases as long as the list contains at least two distinct numbers. If the list has fewer than two distinct numbers, it handles this edge case appropriately by returning `None`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and len(nums) >= 2.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest integer in the list 'unique_nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` (with a minimum length of 2). It first removes duplicate integers by converting `nums` into a set and then back into a list (`unique_nums`). If the resulting list `unique_nums` contains fewer than two unique integers, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest integer in `unique_nums`. This means the function aims to find the second smallest unique integer in the input list `nums`, handling cases where duplicates exist and ensuring the input list has at least two unique elements. If the input list does not meet these conditions, the function returns `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
