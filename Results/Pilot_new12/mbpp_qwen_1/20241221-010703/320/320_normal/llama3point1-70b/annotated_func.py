#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and len(nums) >= 2.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest integer in the list 'unique_nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` (with a minimum length of 2). It first removes duplicate integers by converting `nums` into a set and then back into a list (`unique_nums`). If the resulting list `unique_nums` contains fewer than two unique integers, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest integer in `unique_nums`. This means the function aims to find the second smallest unique integer in the input list `nums`, handling cases where duplicates exist and ensuring the input list has at least two unique elements. If the input list does not meet these conditions, the function returns `None`.
