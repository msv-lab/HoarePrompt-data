Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. The provided assertions verify that the function behaves as expected:
   - For the list `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-2`.
   - For the list `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
   - For the list `[2, 2]`, there are no two distinct elements, so the function returns `None`.
   - For the list `[2, 2, 2]`, again, there are no two distinct elements, so the function returns `None`.

2. **Handling of Input**: The function correctly handles cases where the list has fewer than two distinct elements by returning `None`. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function should return `None` in such cases.

3. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - The function first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates (`set(nums)`).
   - It then sorts the set to obtain a list of unique elements in ascending order (`sorted(set(nums))`).
   - If the length of this sorted list is greater than 1, it returns the second element (`unique_nums[1]`), which is the second smallest number.
   - If the length of the sorted list is 1 or less, it returns `None`.

4. **Assumption Validity**: As per the problem description and the assumption provided, the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., a list of integers), and the program correctly processes these inputs according to the specified requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct in fulfilling the problem description.
