Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Finding the Second Smallest Number**: 
   - The function `func_1` first converts the input list `nums` into a set `unique_nums` to remove duplicates. This ensures that the list contains only distinct elements.
   - Then, it sorts this set to get `unique_nums`, which contains the unique elements in ascending order.
   - Finally, it returns the second element of this sorted list (`unique_nums[1]`) if there are more than one unique elements, otherwise, it returns `None`. This correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided cover various scenarios:
     - `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`: The second smallest number is `-2`.
     - `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`: The second smallest number is `-0.5`.
     - `[2, 2]`: Since all elements are the same, there is no second smallest number, so it returns `None`.
     - `[2, 2, 2]`: Similar to the previous case, it also returns `None`.

3. **Assumptions**:
   - The problem description assumes that the input will always be a valid list of numbers with at least two distinct elements. The program handles this correctly by returning `None` when there are no or only one distinct element.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all tested cases, the correctness is **True**.
