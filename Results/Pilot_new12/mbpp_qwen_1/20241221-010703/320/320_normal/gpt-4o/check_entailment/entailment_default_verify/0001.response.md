Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list. It uses a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements to find the second smallest number. The output hints align with this implementation, confirming that the function behaves as intended. The function correctly returns `None` when there are fewer than two distinct elements in the list, which is consistent with the problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given requirements and test cases.
