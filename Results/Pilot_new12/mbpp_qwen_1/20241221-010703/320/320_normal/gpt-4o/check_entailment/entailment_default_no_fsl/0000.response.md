Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique elements, and returns the second element if there are at least two unique elements. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it returns `None`. This matches the problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the code to fail based on the problem description and the output hints.
