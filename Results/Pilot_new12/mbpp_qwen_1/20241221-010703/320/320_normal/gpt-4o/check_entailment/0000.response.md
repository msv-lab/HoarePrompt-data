Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the list are the same, which would result in a list with only one unique number after converting to a set. In such a case, the function should return `None` as per the problem description. However, the current implementation will throw an `IndexError` because `unique_nums[1]` will be accessed when `len(unique_nums)` is 1. 

For example, consider the input `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The program will return `-1`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
