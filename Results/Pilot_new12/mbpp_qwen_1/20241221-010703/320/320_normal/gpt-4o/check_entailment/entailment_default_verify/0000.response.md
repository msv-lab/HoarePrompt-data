Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` aims to find the second smallest number in a list. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles the case where there are fewer than two distinct elements by returning `None`. However, the original assessment correctly points out that the program throws an `IndexError` when there is only one unique element after removing duplicates. This happens because the code tries to access `unique_nums[1]` when `len(unique_nums)` is 1, which leads to an error. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to handle this edge case by returning `None` instead of trying to access the second element in the list.
