#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second element of the list 'unique_nums' if the length of 'unique_nums' is greater than 1, otherwise returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicate elements from `nums` by converting it to a set and then sorting it to get a list of unique elements in ascending order. If the resulting list of unique elements has more than one element, the function returns the second element; otherwise, it returns `None`. This function handles the case where `nums` has fewer than two distinct elements by returning `None`.
