The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicate elements from `nums` by converting it to a set and then sorting it to get a list of unique elements in ascending order. If the resulting list of unique elements has more than one element, the function returns the second element; otherwise, it returns `None`. This function handles the case where `nums` has fewer than two distinct elements by returning `None`.
