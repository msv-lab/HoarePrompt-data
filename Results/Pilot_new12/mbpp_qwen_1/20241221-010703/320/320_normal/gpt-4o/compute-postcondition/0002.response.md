The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. If the length of the list 'unique_nums' (which contains unique elements from `nums`) is greater than 1, the function returns the second element of `unique_nums`; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements, and return the second element of the list of unique elements if its length is greater than 1, otherwise return `None`.
