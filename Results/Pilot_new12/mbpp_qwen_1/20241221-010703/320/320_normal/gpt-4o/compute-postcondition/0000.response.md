The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` impacts the program by converting the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates and then sorting the resulting set to create a new list `unique_nums`. Since `nums` initially contains at least two distinct elements, after converting it to a set, all elements in `nums` will be unique (assuming no duplicate elements), and then sorting this set will order these unique elements.

Given that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, after executing the code, `unique_nums` will be a sorted list of these distinct elements.

Output State: **`unique_nums` is a sorted list of the distinct elements from `nums`**
