The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function returns the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n, which is calculated as \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \ldots + (2n)^3\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n.
