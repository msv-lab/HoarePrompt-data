#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n, which is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \ldots + (2n)^3\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n, which is calculated as \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \ldots + (2n)^3\). The function first creates a list `even_numbers` containing even numbers from 2 to 2*n using a list comprehension. Then, it calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using another list comprehension and the `sum` function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns this computed sum. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not perform any checks for non-integer or negative inputs. If `n` is 0 or a negative number, the behavior of the function is undefined based on the current implementation.
