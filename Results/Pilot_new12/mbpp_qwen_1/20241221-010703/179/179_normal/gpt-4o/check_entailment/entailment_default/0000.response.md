Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n. The code uses list comprehensions to generate the list of even numbers and then calculates the sum of their cubes. The provided test cases `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800` match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the implementation. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not perform any additional checks for non-integer or negative inputs, which aligns with the assumption that the input will be valid. Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
