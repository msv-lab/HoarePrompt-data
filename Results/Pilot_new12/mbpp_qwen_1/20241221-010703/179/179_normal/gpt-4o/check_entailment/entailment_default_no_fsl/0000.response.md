Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The code uses list comprehensions to generate the list of even numbers and then computes their cubes. The provided assertions check the function with `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, and the results match the expected outputs:

- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes sum up to \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes sum up to \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `n = 4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes sum up to \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

Since the function correctly implements the logic and the provided examples match the expected results, the program meets the requirements for every potential case given the assumptions about valid input.
