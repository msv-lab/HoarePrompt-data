Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as described. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2*n. The code uses a list comprehension to generate the even numbers and another to compute their cubes, and the `sum` function aggregates these values. The provided test cases (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, and `func_1(4) == 800`) validate the implementation. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
