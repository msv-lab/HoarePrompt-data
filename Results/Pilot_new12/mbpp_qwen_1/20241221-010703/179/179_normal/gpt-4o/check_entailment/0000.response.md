Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The test cases given (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, and `func_1(4) == 800`) are specific examples and do indeed validate the implementation. 

The function generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. It then computes the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. Given the mathematical nature of the problem and the test cases, this approach appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Since no counterexample was found, the program is considered correct.
