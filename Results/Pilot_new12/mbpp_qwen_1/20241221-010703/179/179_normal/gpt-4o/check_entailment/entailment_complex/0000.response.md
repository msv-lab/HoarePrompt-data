Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers, which can be expressed as \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \ldots + (2n)^3\). 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input.
   - It generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This list contains the even numbers from 2 up to 2*n.
   - It then computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using another list comprehension inside the `sum` function: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed sum.

The provided test cases (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) also validate that the function works correctly for the given inputs.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and the provided test cases pass, the program is correct.
