Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why:

1. The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer as stated in the problem description.
2. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This list contains the numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
3. It calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using another list comprehension: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
4. The function returns this calculated sum.

The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) verify the correctness of the function for the given inputs, which match the expected results based on the formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid cases.
