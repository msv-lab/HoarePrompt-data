Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, `func_1(4) == 800`) match the expected results:

- For `n=2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\), and their sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n=3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\), and their sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `n=4`, the first four even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(6^3 = 216\), and \(8^3 = 512\), and their sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

The function generates the list of even numbers correctly using a list comprehension and then calculates the cube sum using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function. Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
