Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotation states that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2*n+1`. The provided examples and the logical structure of the code support this. Since the problem description asks for the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, and the function accomplishes this correctly, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
