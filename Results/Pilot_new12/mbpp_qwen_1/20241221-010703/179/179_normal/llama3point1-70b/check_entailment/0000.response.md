Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. Let's verify this:

- For `n = 1`, the first even natural number is 2. The cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).

The program uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to compute the cube of each even number from 2 up to \(2n\) (inclusive), which matches the requirement of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the logic provided. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
