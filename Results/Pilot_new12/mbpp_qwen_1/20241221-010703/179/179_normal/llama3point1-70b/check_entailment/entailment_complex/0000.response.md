Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is a positive integer (as per the problem description).

2. **Sequence Generation**: The function uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` to generate a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 and ending at `2 * n`. This ensures that all numbers in the sequence are even and cover the range up to but not including `2 * n + 1`.

3. **Cubes Calculation**: For each number `i` in the generated sequence, the function computes `i ** 3` (i.e., the cube of `i`).

4. **Summation**: The function uses `sum()` to add up all the cubes of the even numbers within the specified range.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the total sum of these cubes.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
