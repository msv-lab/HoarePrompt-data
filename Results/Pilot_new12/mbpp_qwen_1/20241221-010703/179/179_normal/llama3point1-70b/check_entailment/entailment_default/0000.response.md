Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n + 1`, computes the cube of each number, and returns the sum of these cubes. The code handles the case where `n` is a positive integer as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case within the given constraints.
