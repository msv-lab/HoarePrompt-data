Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including \(2n + 1\), and the `sum` function computes the cube of each number in this sequence, returning their sum. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would render the function incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
