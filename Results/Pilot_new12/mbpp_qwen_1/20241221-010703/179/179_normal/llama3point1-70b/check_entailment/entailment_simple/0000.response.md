Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirement to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The task is to write a Python function that finds the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.
   
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes one parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
   - The function uses a generator expression `i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` to generate the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
     - `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n + 1`.
     - For `n = 1`, it generates the number 2; for `n = 2`, it generates the numbers 2 and 4; and so on.
   - The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of these cubes.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - For `n = 1`, the even natural numbers are [2], and the cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
   - For `n = 2`, the even natural numbers are [2, 4], and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
   - For any positive integer `n`, the function correctly computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Since the function accurately computes the required sum for any positive integer `n`, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
