Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of the first `n` even numbers and then sums them using the `sum()` function.

Let's verify this with some examples:

- For `n = 1`, the first even natural number is 2. The cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

The function correctly handles these cases and any other valid input `n`. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
