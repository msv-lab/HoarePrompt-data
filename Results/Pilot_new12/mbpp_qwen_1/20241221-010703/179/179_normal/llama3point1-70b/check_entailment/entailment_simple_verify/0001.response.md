Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to generate the cubes of the even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n + 1`, and then sums them using the `sum()` function. The provided examples and the annotations support the correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as True.
