Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. It generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n + 1`, computes the cube of each number, and returns their sum. The function works for every potential case where `n` is a positive integer, as per the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all valid inputs.
