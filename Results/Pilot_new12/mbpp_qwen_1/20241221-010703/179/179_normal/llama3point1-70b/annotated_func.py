#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including 2*n+1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including 2*n+1. The function generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 and ending just before 2*n+1, then computes the cube of each number in this sequence, and finally returns the sum of these cubes. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly handles the case where `n` is a positive integer. If `n` were not a positive integer, the function would still execute, but the behavior might be unexpected or incorrect based on the intended use case.
