Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`. It searches for the `element` within the `array`. If the `element` is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. This behavior covers both the presence and absence of the `element` in the `array`. No additional actions are performed on the `array` itself.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the `array` is empty, the function will still attempt to find the `element`, which will result in a `ValueError` being raised. However, since the `array` is empty, the function will return `False` and `-1` as expected.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not modify the `array` in any way. It simply searches for the `element` and returns the appropriate values based on whether the `element` is found or not.
