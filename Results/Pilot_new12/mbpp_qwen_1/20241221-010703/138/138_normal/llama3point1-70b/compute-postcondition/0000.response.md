`index` is assigned the index of `element` in `array`. The value of `index` depends on the position of `element` in `array`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of integers, `element` is an integer, `index` is the index of `element` in `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers, `element` is an integer, `index` is the index of `element` in `array`**
