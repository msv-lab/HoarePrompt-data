The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`. It searches for the `element` within the `array`. If the `element` is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. This behavior covers both the presence and absence of the `element` in the `array`. No additional actions are performed on the `array` itself.
