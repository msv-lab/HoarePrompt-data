Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` and returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element if found, or `False` and `-1` if not found. The annotations indicate that the function handles both cases appropriately, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
