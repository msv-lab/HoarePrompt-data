Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array (list of integers) and an element (integer) as inputs. It uses a try-except block to find the index of the element within the array:

- If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
- If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the except block, and it returns a tuple `(False, -1)`.

This behavior fully satisfies the requirements specified in the problem description, which states that the function should return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). Therefore, the program is correct.
