Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement as described in the problem statement. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index if found. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description and the output hints. The function handles both the presence and absence of the element in the array as specified. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
