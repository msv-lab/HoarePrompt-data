Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for an element in the array using the `index` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. The code handles this exception appropriately by returning `(False, -1)` in such cases. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to cover all potential cases without any missing logic or edge cases.
