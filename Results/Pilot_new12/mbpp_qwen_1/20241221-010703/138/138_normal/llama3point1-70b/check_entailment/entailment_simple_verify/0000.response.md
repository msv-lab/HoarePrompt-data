Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. It uses the `index` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found, and handles this exception appropriately to return the correct tuple. The annotations confirm that the function returns `True` and the index of the element if it is found, and `False` and `-1` if it is not found. Since the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, the program is correct.
