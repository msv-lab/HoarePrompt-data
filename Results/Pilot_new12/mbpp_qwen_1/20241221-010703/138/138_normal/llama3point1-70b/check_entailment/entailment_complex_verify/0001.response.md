Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and the index of the element if found. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, searching for the element in the array and handling the `ValueError` appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
