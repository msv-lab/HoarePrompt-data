Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. It uses the `index` method which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found, and handles this exception to return the appropriate tuple. This approach works for all potential cases, including finding the element and not finding the element. Since the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, the program is correct.
