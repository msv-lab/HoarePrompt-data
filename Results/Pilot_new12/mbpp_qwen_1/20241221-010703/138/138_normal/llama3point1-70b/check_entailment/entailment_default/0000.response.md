Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as inputs and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and the index of the element (or -1 if not found). The code handles all potential cases as specified:

- If the element is found in the array, it returns `(True, index)`.
- If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The use of the `index` method of the list ensures that the first occurrence of the element is returned, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no additional actions performed on the array, and the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
