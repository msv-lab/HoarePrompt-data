Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(array, element)` takes two parameters: `array`, which is expected to be a list of integers, and `element`, which is also expected to be an integer. These match the problem description.

2. **Logic for Finding Element**:
   - Inside the `try` block, the function uses `array.index(element)` to find the index of `element` in the list `array`. If the element is found, this method returns the index, and the function returns `True` and this index as a tuple.
   - If the element is not found in the list, `array.index(element)` raises a `ValueError`. The `except` block catches this exception and returns `False, -1`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If the element is found, the function returns `True` and the index.
   - If the element is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the problem description assumes valid inputs, the function correctly handles the expected cases without needing to check for invalid types or empty lists.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is **True**.
