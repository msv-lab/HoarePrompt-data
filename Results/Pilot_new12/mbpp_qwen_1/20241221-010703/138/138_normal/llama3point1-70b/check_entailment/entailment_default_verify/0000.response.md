Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. The function uses the `index` method, which appropriately raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found, allowing the function to return `(False, -1)`. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected in both cases where the element is found and where it is not. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
