Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected: it returns `(True, index)` if the element is found, and `(False, -1)` if the element is not found. The `try-except` block ensures that the function handles the case where the element is not found in the array by catching the `ValueError` and returning the appropriate tuple. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
