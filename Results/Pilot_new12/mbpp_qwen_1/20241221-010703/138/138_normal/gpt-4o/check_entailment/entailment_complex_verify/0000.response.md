Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The program iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the target element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` indicating the presence and position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This behavior is consistent across all provided test cases.

The annotated version confirms that the function handles all cases correctly, including finding the element at various positions within the list and returning `-1` when the element is not present. The potential edge cases mentioned do not indicate any issues; they merely highlight the behavior of the function under different conditions, which is correctly implemented.

Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
