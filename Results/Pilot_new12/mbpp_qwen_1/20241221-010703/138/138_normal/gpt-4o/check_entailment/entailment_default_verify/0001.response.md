Final: **False**

Reason: Although the function `func_1` appears to handle the cases where the element is found at indices 0, 1, or 2 correctly, the original assessment did not account for the fact that the function only returns the index of the first occurrence of the element. According to the problem description, the function should return the index position of the element, but there is no indication that it handles multiple occurrences of the same element within the array. The output hints confirm this potential issue, stating that the function does not handle the scenario where the element is found at any index other than 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be maintained as the function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
