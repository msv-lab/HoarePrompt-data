Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the scenario where the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. While the function correctly returns `True` and the index when the `element` is found, it does not specify what happens if the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. The function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position. This means the function does not meet the requirement to return the index of the element regardless of its position in the array. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
