Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is in the array and its index position. The original assessment is accurate because:

1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking each element against the target element.
2. If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element.
3. If no match is found after completing the iteration, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as described, handling both cases correctly: finding the element at any index and failing to find it. The provided test cases also validate the function's behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
