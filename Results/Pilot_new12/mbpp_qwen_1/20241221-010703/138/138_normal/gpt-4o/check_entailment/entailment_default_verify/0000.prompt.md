You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the target element, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If no match is found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This approach ensures that the program works for all elements in the array, including edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays without the target element. All provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to search for in the list `arr`. The function searches for the `element` in the list `arr` using a for loop. If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the program returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
- If the `element` is not found in the list, the program returns `False` and `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2.
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is not found in the list, returning `False` and `-1`.

Missing functionality:
- The provided code does not handle the scenario where the `element` is found at any index other than 0, 1, or 2. While the function does return `True` and the correct index when the `element` is found, it does not specify what happens if the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. Therefore, the function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
