Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `element` (the value to search for within the list). It does not validate whether the inputs are valid lists or contain valid integers, which aligns with the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided.

2. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - The function uses a `for` loop combined with `enumerate` to iterate through each element in the list along with its index. This ensures that every element in the list is checked.

3. **Element Matching and Return**:
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element (`value`) matches the `element` being searched. If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)` indicating that the element was found and returning its index.

4. **No Match Handling**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `(False, -1)`. This correctly signifies that the element was not found in the list.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - A list with multiple elements, one of which is the target (`func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)`).
     - A list with multiple elements, and the target is at the end (`func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61)`).
     - A list with multiple elements, and the target is in the middle (`func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48)`).

Given these points, the program consistently adheres to the problem description and behaves as expected for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
