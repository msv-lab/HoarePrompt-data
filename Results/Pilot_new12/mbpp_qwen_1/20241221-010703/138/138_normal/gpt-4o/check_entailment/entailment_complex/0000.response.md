Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirement of returning the correct index for the element in all cases. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element is found and the index of the element. However, the provided implementation uses `return True, index` when the element is found, and `return False, -1` when the element is not found. 

While the function does return `True` and the correct index when the element is found, it always returns `False` and `-1` when the element is not found. This means that even if the element is not present in the list, the function still returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, which satisfies the requirement that the function should return a tuple in both scenarios.

However, the problem description specifies that the function should return a tuple with `True` and the index of the element when found, and `False` and `-1` when not found. The current implementation correctly handles the "not found" case by returning `False` and `-1`, but it does not explicitly mention what happens if the element is found at an index greater than 2, implying that it always returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.

To make the function fully correct, it should explicitly return `True` and the index when the element is found, regardless of its position in the list. The current implementation already does this correctly, so the primary issue is the lack of explicit mention in the comments about handling multiple occurrences of the element. However, since the problem description requires returning `True` and the index when found, the function is still technically correct based on the given description.

Given that the function meets the problem description's requirement of returning the correct tuple structure and values, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **True**
