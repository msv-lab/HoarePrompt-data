You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to search for in the list `arr`. The function searches for the `element` in the list `arr` using a for loop. If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the program returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
- If the `element` is not found in the list, the program returns `False` and `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2.
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is not found in the list, returning `False` and `-1`.

Missing functionality:
- The provided code does not handle the scenario where the `element` is found at any index other than 0, 1, or 2. While the function does return `True` and the correct index when the `element` is found, it does not specify what happens if the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. Therefore, the function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
