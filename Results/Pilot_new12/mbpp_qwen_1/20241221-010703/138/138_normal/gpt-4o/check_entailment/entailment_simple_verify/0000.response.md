Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. The annotated version further clarifies the states of the variables during execution and confirms that the function behaves as expected. Specifically:

1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking each element against the target element.
2. If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)`.
3. If no match is found after completing the loop, it returns `(False, -1)`.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to return a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position if found, or `-1` if not found. The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
