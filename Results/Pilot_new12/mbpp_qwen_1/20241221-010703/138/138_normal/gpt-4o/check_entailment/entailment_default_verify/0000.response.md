Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the program is correct based on the provided test cases. However, upon reviewing the problem description and the output hints, it appears that the program only returns the index of the first occurrence of the element, even if the element appears multiple times in the list. The output hints indicate that the function should return the index of the element if it is found, but they do not explicitly mention that the function should handle multiple occurrences of the element. 

Given the problem description and the expected behavior summarized in the output hints, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the element, which is consistent with the provided test cases. However, the function's behavior does not fully align with the implicit expectation that it should handle multiple occurrences of the element. Since the function does not demonstrate this behavior, it can be considered incomplete or potentially misleading based on the given context. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness should be revised to reflect this understanding.
