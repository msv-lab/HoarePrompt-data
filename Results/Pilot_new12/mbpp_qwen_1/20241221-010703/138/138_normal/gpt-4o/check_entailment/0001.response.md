Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. It checks if the current element matches the target element. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

The function appears to handle all cases correctly based on the problem description. It properly returns the correct boolean value and index for the given assertions. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided examples and the logic implemented.
