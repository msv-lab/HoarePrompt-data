Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position. This does not meet the requirement to return the index of the element if it is found at any index in the list. The problem description states that the function should return the index of the `element` if it is found, but the code currently only returns the index of the first occurrence. To satisfy the problem description, the function should return the index of the last occurrence of the `element` if it is found multiple times. Since the code does not handle this case, it is considered incorrect.
