Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the target element in the array and return the appropriate tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected:

- When the target element is found during the iteration, the function immediately returns `(True, index)`.
- If the target element is not found by the end of the iteration, the function returns `(False, -1)`.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to return a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index position of the element (or `-1` if not found). The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly in all tested scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
