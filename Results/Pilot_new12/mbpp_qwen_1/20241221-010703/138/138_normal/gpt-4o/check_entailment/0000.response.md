Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the target element, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If no match is found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This approach ensures that the program works for all elements in the array, including edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays without the target element. All provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the implementation.
