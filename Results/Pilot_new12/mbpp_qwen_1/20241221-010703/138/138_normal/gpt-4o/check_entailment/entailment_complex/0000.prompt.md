You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element is the value to search for in the list arr.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements, `element` is the value to search for in the list `arr`, `value` is the last element in the list `arr`, `index` is the index of the last element in the list (length of `arr` - 1), and the function returns `True` and `index` if the `element` is found in the list `arr`, otherwise it returns `False` and `None` if the loop completes without finding the `element`.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to search for in the list `arr`. The function searches for the `element` in the list `arr` using a for loop. If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the program returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
- If the `element` is not found in the list, the program returns `False` and `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2.
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is not found in the list, returning `False` and `-1`.

Missing functionality:
- The provided code does not handle the scenario where the `element` is found at any index other than 0, 1, or 2. While the function does return `True` and the correct index when the `element` is found, it does not specify what happens if the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. Therefore, the function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
