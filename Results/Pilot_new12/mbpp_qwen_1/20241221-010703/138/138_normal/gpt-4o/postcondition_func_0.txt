The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to search for in the list `arr`. The function searches for the `element` in the list `arr` using a for loop. If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If the `element` is found at any index in the list, the program returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
- If the `element` is not found in the list, the program returns `False` and `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2.
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is not found in the list, returning `False` and `-1`.

Missing functionality:
- The provided code does not handle the scenario where the `element` is found at any index other than 0, 1, or 2. While the function does return `True` and the correct index when the `element` is found, it does not specify what happens if the `element` is found at an index greater than 2. Therefore, the function always returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list, regardless of its position.
