Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `element` is the value to search for in the list `arr`, `value` is the last element in the list `arr`, `index` is the index of the last element in the list (length of `arr` - 1), and the function returns `True` and `index` if the `element` is found in the list `arr`, otherwise it returns `False` and `None` if the loop completes without finding the `element`.**
