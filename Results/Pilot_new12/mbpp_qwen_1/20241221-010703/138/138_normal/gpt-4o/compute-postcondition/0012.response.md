The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to search for in the list `arr`. 

- If `element` is found at index 0, the function returns `True` and the index 0.
- If `element` is found at index 1, the function returns `True` and the index 1.
- If `element` is found at index 2, the function returns `True` and the index 2.
- If `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and a value `element`, and return whether `element` is found in `arr` along with its index, or return `False` and -1 if `element` is not found.
