According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must contain at least one element. Additionally, the initial state should include the variable `value`, which represents the current element being examined in each iteration of the loop. Initially, `value` will be the first element in the list.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The list `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. Initially, the variable `value` will be the first element in the list `arr`.
3. The variable `index` will start at 0, as it is the index of the first element in the list.

Given these points, we can formulate the required initial state as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `value` is the first element in the list `arr`, `index` is 0**
