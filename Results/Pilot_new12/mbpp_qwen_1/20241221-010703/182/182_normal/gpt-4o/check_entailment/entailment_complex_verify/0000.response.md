Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version further clarifies that the function takes a tuple containing strings as input and returns a list of the last characters from each string. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors in the function, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
