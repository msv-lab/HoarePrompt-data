Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. Given the examples and the problem description, the function works as expected for the provided test cases and there are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail. The code handles tuples containing non-empty strings and produces the correct output. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
