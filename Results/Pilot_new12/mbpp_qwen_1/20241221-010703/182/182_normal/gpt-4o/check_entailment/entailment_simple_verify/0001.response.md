Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version of the code further clarifies that `tup` is a tuple containing strings, and the function returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
