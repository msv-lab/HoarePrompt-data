Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (the last character) from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and appends the last character of each string to a new list. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function handles the given examples correctly and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the function appears to be correct for the described task.
