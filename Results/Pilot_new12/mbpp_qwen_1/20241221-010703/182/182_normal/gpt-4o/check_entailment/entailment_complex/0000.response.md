Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description specifies. The function correctly handles tuples with multiple strings and returns a list with the appropriate elements. Additionally, the function does not modify the input tuple and gracefully handles empty strings by including an empty string in the result, which is also in line with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
