Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The annotations clarify that the function returns a list of the last characters from each string in the input tuple `tup`. Although the annotations mention that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will include an empty string in the resulting list, this behavior does not contradict the problem description since the problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings. Therefore, the function meets the requirements as described.
