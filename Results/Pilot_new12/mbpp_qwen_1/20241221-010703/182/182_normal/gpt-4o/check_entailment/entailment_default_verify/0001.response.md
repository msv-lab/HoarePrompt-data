Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the input tuple. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. There are no indications that the function does not handle empty strings appropriately (returning an empty string for an empty input), nor are there any mentioned issues with modifying the input tuple or handling invalid inputs, as we are assuming valid input as per the instructions. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
