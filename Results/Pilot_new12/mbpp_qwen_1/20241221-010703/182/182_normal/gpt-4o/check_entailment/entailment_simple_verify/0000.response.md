Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (the last character) from each string in the given tuple. The annotated version of the code clarifies that `tup` is a tuple containing strings, and the function processes each string in the tuple to return a list of their respective last characters. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected. Since the function handles the given examples correctly and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the function appears to be correct for the described task. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
