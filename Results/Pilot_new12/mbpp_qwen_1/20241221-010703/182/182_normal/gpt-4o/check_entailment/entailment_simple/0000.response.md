Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
