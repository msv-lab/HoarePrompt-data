Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the input tuple. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. There are no issues with handling empty strings or invalid inputs, as per the provided assumptions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
