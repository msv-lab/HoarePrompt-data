Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`. This approach handles all cases where the input tuple contains non-empty strings. Even though the output hints suggest that the function includes an empty string in the result if any string in the tuple is empty, this is not the behavior of the provided code. The code works correctly for the given examples and the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the constraints provided.
