#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing strings.
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple `tup`. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will include an empty string in the resulting list. The function does not modify the input tuple and does not raise any exceptions for invalid inputs.
