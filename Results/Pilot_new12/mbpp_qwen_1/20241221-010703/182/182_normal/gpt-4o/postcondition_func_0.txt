The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple `tup`. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will include an empty string in the resulting list. The function does not modify the input tuple and does not raise any exceptions for invalid inputs.
