Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` effectively iterates through each string in the tuple and appends its last character to the resulting list. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple, with empty strings being handled appropriately if any string in the tuple is empty. Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any issues, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
