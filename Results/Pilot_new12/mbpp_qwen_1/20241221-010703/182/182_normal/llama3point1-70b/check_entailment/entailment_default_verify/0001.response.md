Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning an empty string for any empty input string within the tuple. There are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned that would cause this function to fail, and it works as intended for any valid input tuple of strings. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
