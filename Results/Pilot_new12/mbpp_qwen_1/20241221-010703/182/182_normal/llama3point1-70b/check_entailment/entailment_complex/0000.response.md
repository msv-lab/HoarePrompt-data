Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The function iterates over each string in the tuple using a list comprehension and returns a list of the last characters from each string. This directly aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should extract the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The function handles all non-empty strings appropriately and produces the expected output even for empty strings, returning an empty string for them as well. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description without any deviations, the correctness is **True**.
