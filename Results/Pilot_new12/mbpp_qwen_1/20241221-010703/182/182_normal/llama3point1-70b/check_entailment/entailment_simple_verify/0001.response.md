Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks to extract the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotations further support this by stating that the program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'strings'. Given the input is assumed to be valid, the function behaves as expected and is correct.
