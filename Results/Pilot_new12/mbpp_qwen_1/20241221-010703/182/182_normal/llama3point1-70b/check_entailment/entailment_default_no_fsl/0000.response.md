Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`. This approach handles all potential cases, including when a string is empty, in which case `s[-1]` will result in an empty string. Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases that need special handling and the code follows the required functionality without issues, the program is correct.
