Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. This matches the problem description perfectly. Given any tuple of strings, the function will correctly extract the rear index element (last character) of each string. Since there are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned that would cause this function to fail, and it works as expected for any valid input, the function is correct.
