Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This exactly matches the problem description which states that the function should extract only the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` correctly iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts its last character, ensuring the program's behavior aligns with the stated requirement.
