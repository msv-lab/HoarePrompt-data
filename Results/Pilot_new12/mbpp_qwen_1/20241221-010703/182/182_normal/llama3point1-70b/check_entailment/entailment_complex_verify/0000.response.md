Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each string in the tuple and collects the last character of each string into a list. The annotation also mentions that if any string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string, which is consistent with the default behavior of Python list comprehensions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment should be maintained as **True**.
