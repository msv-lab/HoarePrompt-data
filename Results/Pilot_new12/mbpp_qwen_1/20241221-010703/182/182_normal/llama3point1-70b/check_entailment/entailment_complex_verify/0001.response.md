Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The annotated version further clarifies that the function iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using list comprehension. It also mentions that if any string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string, which is consistent with the behavior of indexing an empty string (`''[-1]` results in an empty string). Since there are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid input, the function remains correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
