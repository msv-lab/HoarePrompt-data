Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to extract the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The function iterates over each string in the tuple using a list comprehension and extracts the last character (`s[-1]`) of each string. The output matches the problem description, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the hints that would cause the function to fail. For instance, if any string in the tuple is empty, the function correctly returns an empty string for that particular element. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
