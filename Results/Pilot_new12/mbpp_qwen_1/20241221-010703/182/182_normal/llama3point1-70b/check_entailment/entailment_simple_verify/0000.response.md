Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character from each string in the given tuple. The annotation clearly states that `strings` is a tuple of strings, and the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` correctly collects the last character of each string in the tuple. There is no evidence from the annotated version that suggests any part of the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains accurate.
