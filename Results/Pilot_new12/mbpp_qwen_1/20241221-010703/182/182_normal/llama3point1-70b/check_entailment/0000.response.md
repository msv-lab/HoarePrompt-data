Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly extracts the rear index (last) element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and collects the last character of each string. This implementation works for any tuple of strings, including empty tuples or tuples containing strings of different lengths. Since the program handles all described cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
