Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `strings`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need special handling beyond the default behavior of Python list comprehensions and tuple iteration.**

This summary covers the functionality based on the actual code, including the handling of empty strings, which is a potential case to consider given the nature of list comprehensions and tuple iteration in Python.
