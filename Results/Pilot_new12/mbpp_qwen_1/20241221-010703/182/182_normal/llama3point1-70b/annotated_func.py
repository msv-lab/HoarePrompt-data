#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'strings'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `strings`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need special handling beyond the default behavior of Python list comprehensions and tuple iteration.
