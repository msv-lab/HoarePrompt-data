The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values. It calculates the average of the corresponding position's elements across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position from each tuple, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. If the `tuples` list is empty, the function will return an empty list. This process handles both integer and float values within the tuples.
