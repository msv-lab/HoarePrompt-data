Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the first tuple to extract the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The assertions provided in the problem description also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles all positions correctly and the provided test cases cover various scenarios, there is no evidence of a potential case where the program does not work as described.
