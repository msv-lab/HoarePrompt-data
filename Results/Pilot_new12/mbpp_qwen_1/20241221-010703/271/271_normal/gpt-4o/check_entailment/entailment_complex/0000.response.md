Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples. This matches the requirement to handle a list of tuples containing numerical values.

2. **Averaging Mechanism**: 
   - The function first determines the number of elements in each tuple by taking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`).
   - It then iterates over each position `i` up to `num_elements`, collecting the value at position `i` from each tuple into the list `elements_at_position`.
   - For each position, it calculates the average by summing the collected elements and dividing by the number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).
   - Finally, it appends the computed average to the `averages` list.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the `averages` list, which contains the averages of corresponding positions across all tuples.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases validate different scenarios:
   - Different sets of numerical values (including negative numbers, integers, and floats).
   - Different tuple lengths.

Given these points, the function consistently performs the required operation of calculating the average of corresponding positions in a list of tuples and returning those averages in a list. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
