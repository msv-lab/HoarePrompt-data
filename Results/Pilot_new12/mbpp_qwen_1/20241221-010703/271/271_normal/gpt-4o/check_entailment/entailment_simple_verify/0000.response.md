Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements, collects the values at each position across all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. Given the provided test cases, the function produces the correct results, and the annotations support the correctness of the function's behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
