Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the function iterates over each position in the first tuple, extracts the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases in the assertions also validate the correctness of the function. There is no evidence in the annotated version or the original assessment that suggests the program does not meet the problem description.
