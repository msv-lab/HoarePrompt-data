Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations support this correctness by clearly detailing the state of the program at various stages, indicating that the function iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected, producing the correct results for the given inputs. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program is correct.
