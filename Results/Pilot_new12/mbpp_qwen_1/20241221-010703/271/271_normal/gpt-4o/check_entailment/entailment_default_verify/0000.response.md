Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements, then collects the values at each position across all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input correctly and provides the correct averages as demonstrated by the test cases. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given constraints.
