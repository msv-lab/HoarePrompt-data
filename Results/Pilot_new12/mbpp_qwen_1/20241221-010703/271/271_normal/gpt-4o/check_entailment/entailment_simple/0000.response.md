Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument which is expected to be a tuple of tuples (a list of tuples). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Average Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `num_elements` as the length of the first tuple, ensuring it calculates the average for each corresponding index across all tuples.
   - It iterates over each index position (`i`) using a for loop.
   - For each index `i`, it collects all elements from that position across all tuples into the list `elements_at_position`.
   - It calculates the average of these elements by dividing the sum of the collected elements by the number of tuples.
   - These averages are stored in the list `averages`.
   - Finally, it returns the list of averages.

3. **Correctness for Provided Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided in the assertions validate the function for different inputs, including various integer and float values. The results match the expected output, confirming the implementation works as intended.

4. **Handling Valid Input**: 
   - Since the problem assumes valid input, the program does not need to handle edge cases like invalid data types or empty tuples (as specified).

Given that the program correctly computes the average for each corresponding index across all tuples and matches the provided test cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
