You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements, then collects the values at each position across all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any list of tuples with the same number of elements in each tuple. Given the provided test cases, the function produces the correct results, and there are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values. It calculates the average of the corresponding position's elements across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position from each tuple, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. If the `tuples` list is empty, the function will return an empty list. This process handles both integer and float values within the tuples.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
