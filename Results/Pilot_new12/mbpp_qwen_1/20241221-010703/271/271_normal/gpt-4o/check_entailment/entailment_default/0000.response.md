Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples and returns a list of these averages. The code handles all given test cases correctly and works for every potential case within the constraints of the problem description. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position from each tuple, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. This process ensures that the function works for both integer and float values within the tuples, and it handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
