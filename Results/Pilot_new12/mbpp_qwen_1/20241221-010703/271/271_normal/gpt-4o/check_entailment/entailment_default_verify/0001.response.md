Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_1` function correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the first tuple, collects the elements at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The output hints further support this by explaining the function's behavior in detail. There is no evidence from the provided information that suggests the program does not meet the problem description.
