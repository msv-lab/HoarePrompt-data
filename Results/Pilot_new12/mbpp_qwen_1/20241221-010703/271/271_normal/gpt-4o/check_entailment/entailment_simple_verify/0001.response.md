Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations support this by describing the state of the program at different points, indicating that the function correctly processes each position in the tuples and calculates the average as expected. The provided test cases in the assertions also confirm that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
