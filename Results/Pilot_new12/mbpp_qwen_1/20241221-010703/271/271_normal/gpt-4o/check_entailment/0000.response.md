Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements, then collects the values at each position across all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any list of tuples with the same number of elements in each tuple. Given the provided test cases, the function produces the correct results, and there are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail.
