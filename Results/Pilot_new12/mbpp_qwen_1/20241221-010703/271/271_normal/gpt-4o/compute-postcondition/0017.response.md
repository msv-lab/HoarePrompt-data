Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values. It calculates the average of the corresponding position's elements across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position from each tuple, computes their average, and appends it to the `averages` list. If the `tuples` list is empty, the function will return an empty list. This process handles both integer and float values within the tuples.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If the `tuples` list is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list.
- The function assumes that all tuples have the same number of elements. If this is not the case, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to access an index that does not exist in one of the tuples. No special handling is provided for tuples of varying lengths.
