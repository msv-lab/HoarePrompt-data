According to the code, the loop iterates over `num_elements`. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `num_elements`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing one additional element (the calculated average), `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, and `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1` for the next iteration. Additionally, `averages` will have one more element added, and `elements_at_position` will contain elements from the tuples at the new position `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `tuples` is a list of tuples.
- `num_elements` is greater than 0.
- `averages` is a list containing one additional element.
- `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`.
- `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `i + 1`, `averages` should have another element added, and `elements_at_position` should contain elements from the tuples at the new position `i + 1`.

State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing two additional elements (the calculated avg), `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i + 1`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.**
