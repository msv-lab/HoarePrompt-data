The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The value of `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 1, `tuples` contains more than one tuple, and `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, the length of `tuples` is greater than 1. Therefore, `avg` is calculated as the sum of these elements divided by the number of tuples.

After appending `avg` to `averages`, the `averages` list now contains four elements: the original three elements plus the new `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing four elements, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.**
