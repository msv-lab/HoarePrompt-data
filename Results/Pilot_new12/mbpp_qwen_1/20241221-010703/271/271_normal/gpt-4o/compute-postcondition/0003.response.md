The code creates a list called `elements_at_position` which contains the elements at a specific position `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`. The exact values of the tuples and the position `i` are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep them general.

- `tuples` remains a list of tuples.
- `num_elements` is unchanged and is still greater than 0.
- `averages` remains an empty list.

The impact of the code on the program is that a new list `elements_at_position` is created, containing elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`.**
