`avg` is assigned the value of the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The value of `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at a certain position, and the length of `tuples` is `num_elements`. The `averages` list remains empty as no operation was performed on it, and the other variables (`tuples`, `num_elements`, `elements_at_position`) are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the `averages` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.**
