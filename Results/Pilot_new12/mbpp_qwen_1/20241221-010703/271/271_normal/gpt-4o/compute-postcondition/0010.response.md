According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. If `i` is less than `num_elements`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing three elements, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, and `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`. Additionally, `num_elements` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Here's the state adjustment:

- `tuples` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `num_elements` remains greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration).
- `averages` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `elements_at_position` will now contain elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i + 1`.
- `avg` will be recalculated based on the new `elements_at_position`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing three elements, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i + 1`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`**.
