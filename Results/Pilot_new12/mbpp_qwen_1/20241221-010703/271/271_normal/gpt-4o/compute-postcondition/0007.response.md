The code `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]` creates a new list `elements_at_position` by extracting the element at index `i` from each tuple in the list `tuples`. This operation does not change the values of `tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, or `avg`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing two additional elements (the calculated avg), `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing two additional elements (the calculated avg), `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by `num_elements`.**
