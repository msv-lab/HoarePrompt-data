`averages` is a list containing two additional elements and `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The code appends `avg` to the `averages` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing three elements (the original two plus the newly appended `avg`), `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing three elements, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.**
