The code initializes an empty list named `averages`. This does not affect the existing values of `tuples` or `num_elements`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `averages` list.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numerical values (integers or floats); `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first tuple of `tuples`; `averages` is an empty list**
