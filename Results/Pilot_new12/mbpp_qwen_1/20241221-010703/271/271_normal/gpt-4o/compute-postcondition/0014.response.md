Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is a positive integer, `averages` is a list of `num_elements` elements, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.**

### Explanation:
- **`tuples`**: Remains unchanged throughout the loop as the list of tuples is not modified within the loop.
- **`num_elements`**: Must be a positive integer because the loop runs for `num_elements` times.
- **`averages`**: Will be a list containing `num_elements` elements, each representing the average of the corresponding position across all tuples in `tuples`.
- **`elements_at_position`**: This list contains the elements from each tuple in `tuples` at position `i`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `num_elements - 1`.
- **`avg`**: For each iteration, `avg` is the average of the elements at position `i` across all tuples. After the loop completes, this value will be stored in the `averages` list.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `num_elements` is 0):
- **`tuples`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`num_elements`**: Is 0.
- **`averages`**: Stays as an empty list since no elements are added to it.

This ensures that the final state of the program accurately reflects the completion of the loop and the values of all relevant variables.
