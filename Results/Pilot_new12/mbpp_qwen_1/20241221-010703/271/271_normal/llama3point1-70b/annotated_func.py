#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated by summing the corresponding elements across all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values. It calculates the average of each corresponding element across all tuples and returns a list of these averages. Specifically, it transposes the list of tuples using `zip(*tuples)`, then calculates the sum of each resulting tuple and divides by the number of tuples to find the average. This process handles cases where the input list of tuples might be empty or contain tuples of varying lengths. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will still compute the averages based on the available elements in each position.
