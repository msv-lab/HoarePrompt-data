Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of averages. Each element in the returned list is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., a list of tuples containing numerical values. Therefore, no additional validation is needed, and the program is considered correct based on this assumption.

2. **Calculation of Averages**: The program uses the `zip(*tuples)` function to transpose the list of tuples, effectively aligning the corresponding elements vertically. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over these aligned elements, calculates their sum, and divides by the length of the list of tuples to find the average.

3. **Output Format**: The output is a list of these calculated averages, which matches the expected result format.

Since the program correctly performs the specified operation without any edge cases or assumptions that violate the problem description, it meets the requirements.
