Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. The output hints confirm this behavior and also mention that the function handles cases where the input list of tuples might be empty or contain tuples of varying lengths. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
