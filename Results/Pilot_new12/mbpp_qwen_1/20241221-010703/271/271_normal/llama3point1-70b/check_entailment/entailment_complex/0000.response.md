Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description does not specify any validation for the input. Therefore, the function assumes that the input will be a list of tuples containing numerical values, and this is handled correctly.

2. **Transpose Operation**: The line `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, effectively creating a structure where each value in the resulting zipped tuples corresponds to the same position across all input tuples. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Average Calculation**: The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` calculates the sum of each zipped tuple and then divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This also aligns with the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If the input list is empty, `zip(*tuples)` will return an empty iterator, and the list comprehension will produce an empty list, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - If the tuples have different lengths, the operation will still compute the average based on the available elements in each position, as the function iterates over each zipped tuple.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description.
