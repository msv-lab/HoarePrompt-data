Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a list of tuples, the function `func_1` computes the average of each corresponding element across all tuples. It uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position and calculate the average. The function handles cases where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, and it also correctly handles tuples of varying lengths by only considering the available elements in each position. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case based on the provided problem description and output hints.
