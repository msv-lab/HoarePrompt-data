Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. This approach works for any list of tuples where the length of each tuple is the same. Even though the annotated version mentions handling cases where tuples might have different lengths, the problem description does not specify any constraints on the length of the tuples or the number of tuples. Therefore, the function is correct according to the given problem description.
