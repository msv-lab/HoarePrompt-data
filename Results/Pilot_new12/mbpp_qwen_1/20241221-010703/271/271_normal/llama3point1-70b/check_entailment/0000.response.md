Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. This approach ensures that the function works for any number of tuples and any number of elements within those tuples, as long as the tuples are of the same length. Since the function correctly implements the described behavior for all tested cases and there are no obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
