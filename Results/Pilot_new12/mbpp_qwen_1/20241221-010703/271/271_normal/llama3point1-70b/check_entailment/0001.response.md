Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. This approach works for any list of tuples where the length of each tuple is the same. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the length of the tuples or the number of tuples, and the function handles these cases correctly, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
