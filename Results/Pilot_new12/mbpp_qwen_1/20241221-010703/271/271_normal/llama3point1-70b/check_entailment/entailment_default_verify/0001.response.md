Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. This approach is valid for any list of tuples where the length of each tuple is the same, and it also handles cases where the input list of tuples might be empty, returning an empty list in such cases. The provided output hints further confirm this behavior, stating that the function calculates the average of each corresponding element across all tuples and returns a list of these averages. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
