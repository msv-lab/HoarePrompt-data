Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotation clearly states that the function returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated by summing the corresponding elements across all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples. This matches the problem description, which requires the function to return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The annotated version provides clear evidence supporting the correctness of the function as described.
