Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. Since the annotated version supports this behavior and the function handles the cases correctly without any assumptions about invalid inputs (as per the given constraints), the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
