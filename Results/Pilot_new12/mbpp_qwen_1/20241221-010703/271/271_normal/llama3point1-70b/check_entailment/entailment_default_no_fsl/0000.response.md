Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of tuples, transposes them using `zip(*tuples)`, calculates the sum of each corresponding element, and then divides by the number of tuples to find the average. This approach works for cases where the input list of tuples is empty, contains tuples of varying lengths, or even when all tuples have the same length. The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description and output hints.
