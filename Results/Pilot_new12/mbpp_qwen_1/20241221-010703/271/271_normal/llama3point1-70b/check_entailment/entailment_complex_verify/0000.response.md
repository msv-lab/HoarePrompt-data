Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position and calculate the average of the values at that position. This approach ensures that the function works for any number of tuples and any number of elements within those tuples, as long as the tuples are of the same length. The annotated version confirms that the function transposes the list of tuples, sums the corresponding elements, and divides by the number of tuples to find the average. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
