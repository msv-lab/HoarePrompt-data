You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated by summing the corresponding elements across all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values. It calculates the average of each corresponding element across all tuples and returns a list of these averages. Specifically, it transposes the list of tuples using `zip(*tuples)`, then calculates the sum of each resulting tuple and divides by the number of tuples to find the average. This process handles cases where the input list of tuples might be empty or contain tuples of varying lengths. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will still compute the averages based on the available elements in each position.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
