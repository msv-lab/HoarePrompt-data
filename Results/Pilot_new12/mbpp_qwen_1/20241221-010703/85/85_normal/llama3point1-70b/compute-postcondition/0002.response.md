Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and returns the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list `arr`. It performs this operation by first identifying the maximum and minimum values within the list and then calculating their difference. This calculation is done using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions. The function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list `arr` is empty, as both `max()` and `min()` cannot operate on an empty list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list `arr` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because it is not possible to determine the maximum and minimum values in an empty list.
- If the input list `arr` contains only one element, the function will return 0 since the difference between the maximum and minimum value is zero.

**Final State:**
After the function concludes, the program will return a single integer representing the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input list `arr`. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError`.
