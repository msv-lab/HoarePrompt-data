Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases. Given an array, the function will always return the correct maximum difference. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the input is a valid list of numbers.
