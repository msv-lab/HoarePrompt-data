Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as arrays with duplicate elements, arrays with negative numbers, and arrays with a single element (though the latter would result in a difference of 0). Since the function accurately implements the required functionality for all potential cases, the program is correct.
