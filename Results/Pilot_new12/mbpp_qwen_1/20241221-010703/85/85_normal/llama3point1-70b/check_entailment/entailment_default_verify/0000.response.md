Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach is indeed correct and works for all valid inputs, as per the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function operates correctly on a list of integers, identifies the maximum and minimum values, and calculates their difference. The fact that the function raises a `ValueError` for an empty list is a valid handling of an edge case, aligning with the expectations for the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
