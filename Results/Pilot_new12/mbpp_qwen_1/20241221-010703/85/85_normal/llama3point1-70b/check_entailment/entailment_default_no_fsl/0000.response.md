Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and then computing their difference using the `max()` and `min()` functions. The problem description asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the function meets this requirement for any non-empty list of integers. The function handles the case where the list is empty by raising a `ValueError`, which aligns with the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
