Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. This is achieved by using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the list, respectively, and then computing their difference.

The function meets the problem description for all valid cases because:
1. It accepts a list of integers as input.
2. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
3. It handles the case where the list is empty by raising a `ValueError`, although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling this case (as per the assumption).

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles the expected input correctly, the correctness of the program is True.
