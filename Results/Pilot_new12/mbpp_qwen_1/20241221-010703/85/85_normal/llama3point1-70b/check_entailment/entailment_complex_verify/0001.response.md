Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The annotated version confirms that the function identifies the maximum and minimum values within the list and then calculates their difference. While the annotated version mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list `arr` is empty, this is a valid concern, but the original problem description did not explicitly mention handling empty lists. Given that the original assessment considered the function correct for all potential cases, and the annotated version supports this, the program remains correct under the assumption of valid input as stated in the problem description.
