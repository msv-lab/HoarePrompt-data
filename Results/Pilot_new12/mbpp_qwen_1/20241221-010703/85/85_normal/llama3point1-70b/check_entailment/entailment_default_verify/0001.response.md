Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The output hints confirm that the function identifies the maximum and minimum values within the list and then calculates their difference. While the output hints mention that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, this does not affect the correctness of the program for non-empty lists, which is the focus of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
