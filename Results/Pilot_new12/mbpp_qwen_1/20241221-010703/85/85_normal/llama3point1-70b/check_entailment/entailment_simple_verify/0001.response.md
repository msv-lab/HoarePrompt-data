Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the list. The annotations describe the state of the program and the operations performed, aligning with the problem description. Since the function handles all potential cases, including edge cases like arrays with duplicate elements, arrays with negative numbers, and arrays with a single element (resulting in a difference of 0), the program is correct.
