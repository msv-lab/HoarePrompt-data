Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the maximum and minimum values and subtracting them. The function handles the case where the input list `arr` is empty by raising a `ValueError`, which aligns with the problem description that assumes valid input. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
