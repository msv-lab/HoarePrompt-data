Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as expected on a list of integers. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (assuming valid input), and the function `func_1` meets this requirement, the original assessment is correct.
