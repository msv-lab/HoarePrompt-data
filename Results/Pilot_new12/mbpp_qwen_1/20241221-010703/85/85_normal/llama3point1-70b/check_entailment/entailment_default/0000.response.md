Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(arr)` returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases like arrays with duplicate values, single-element arrays, and large arrays. The output hints confirm that the function operates as intended, and no counterexamples were found where the program does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
