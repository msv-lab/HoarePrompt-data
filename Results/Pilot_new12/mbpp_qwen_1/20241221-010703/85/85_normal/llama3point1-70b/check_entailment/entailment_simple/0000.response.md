Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Specifically:

- It takes a list of integers (`arr`) as input.
- It calculates the maximum value in the list using `max(arr)`.
- It calculates the minimum value in the list using `min(arr)`.
- It returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Since the function adheres to the specified problem description for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
