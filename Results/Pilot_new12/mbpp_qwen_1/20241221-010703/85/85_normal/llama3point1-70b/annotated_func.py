#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum integer in list 'arr' and the minimum integer in list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and returns the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list `arr`. It performs this operation by first identifying the maximum and minimum values within the list and then calculating their difference. This calculation is done using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions. The function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list `arr` is empty, as both `max()` and `min()` cannot operate on an empty list.
