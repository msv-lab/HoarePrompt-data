The code sets `max_val` to the maximum value in the list `arr`. Since the initial state tells us that `arr` is a list of integers and `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, the value of `min_val` remains unchanged, but `max_val` is now set to the maximum value in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`**
