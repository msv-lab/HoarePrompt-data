The code calculates the difference between the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) in the list `arr` and assigns this difference to the variable `max_diff`. The variables `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`**
