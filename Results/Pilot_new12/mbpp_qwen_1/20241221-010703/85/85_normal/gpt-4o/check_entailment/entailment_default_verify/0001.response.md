Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array for the provided test cases, the original assessment does not consider the scenario where the input list is empty. The output hints explicitly mention that calling `min()` or `max()` on an empty list will result in a `ValueError`. Since the problem description and the provided assertions do not account for this edge case, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this oversight.
