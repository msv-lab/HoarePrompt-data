Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotations confirm that the program first determines the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculates the difference between them. This approach is valid for any list of integers with at least two elements. The examples given in the assertions demonstrate that the function `func_1` works as intended. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
