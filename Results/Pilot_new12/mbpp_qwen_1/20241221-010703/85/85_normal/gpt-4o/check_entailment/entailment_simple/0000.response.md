Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. This is achieved by finding the minimum and maximum values in the list using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively, and then calculating their difference. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`. The difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`. The difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`. The difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the program always calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array as required by the problem description, it is correct.
