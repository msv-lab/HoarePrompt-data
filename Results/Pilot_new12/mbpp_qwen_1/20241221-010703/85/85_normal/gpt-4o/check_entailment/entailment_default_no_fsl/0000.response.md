Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (list of integers). The code handles all the potential cases mentioned:

1. When the array has multiple elements, it correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values and calculates the difference.
2. The code correctly handles arrays with exactly two elements.
3. The code raises a `ValueError` when the array is empty, which aligns with the hint and the problem description.

Since the code works correctly for all the provided assertions and the hints confirm its behavior, the program is correct.
