Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works as expected. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculates the difference between them. This approach ensures that the function will correctly compute the maximum difference for any valid input list, including edge cases like lists with only one element or lists where the maximum and minimum values are far apart.

The output hints also confirm that the function operates correctly under the described conditions. The function handles valid inputs appropriately and raises no unexpected errors under the assumption that the input is always a valid list of integers.
