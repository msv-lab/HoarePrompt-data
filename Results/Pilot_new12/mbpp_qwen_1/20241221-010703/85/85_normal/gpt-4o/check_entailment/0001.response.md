Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and computes their difference, which is the maximum difference possible. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A list with positive integers: `assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4` (Difference between 5 and 1 is 4)
2. A list with positive integers including a larger range: `assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8` (Difference between 9 and 1 is 8)
3. A list with decreasing order: `assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2` (Difference between 3 and 1 is 2)

The function works correctly for these cases and should handle any valid input array of integers. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
