Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as input and correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively, and calculates the difference. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function handles all provided test cases correctly, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
