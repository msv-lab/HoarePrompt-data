Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and then computes their difference, which is the maximum difference possible. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate the function's correctness. The annotated version also mentions that if the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`, but since the problem description and the original assessment do not consider invalid inputs and focus on valid inputs, this is acceptable. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
