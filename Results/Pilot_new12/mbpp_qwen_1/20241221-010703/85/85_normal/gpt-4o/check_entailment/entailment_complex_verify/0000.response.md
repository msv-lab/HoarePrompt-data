Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the program's behavior. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and then subtracting them. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for arrays of different sizes and values. Although the annotation mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, the problem description does not specify handling for invalid inputs. Given that we are assuming valid input, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
