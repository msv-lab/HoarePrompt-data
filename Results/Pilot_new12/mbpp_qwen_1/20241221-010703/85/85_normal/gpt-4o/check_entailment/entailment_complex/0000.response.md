Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem description requires writing a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` accomplishes this by:
   - Finding the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
   - Finding the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
   - Calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated difference, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the array is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because `min()` and `max()` cannot be called on an empty list. However, the problem description specifies that the input will be valid, so this edge case is implicitly handled.
   - If the array has only one element, the difference will naturally be zero, which aligns with the problem description.
   
Given that the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles the specified edge cases (as per the problem description's assumption of valid input), the program is correct.
