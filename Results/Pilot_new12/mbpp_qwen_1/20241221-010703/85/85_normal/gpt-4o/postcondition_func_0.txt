The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. It first determines the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the list `arr`. Then, it calculates the difference between these two values (`max_diff`). If the list `arr` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because calling `min()` or `max()` on an empty list will result in such an error. If the list contains only one element, the difference will be zero since both `min_val` and `max_val` will be the same.
