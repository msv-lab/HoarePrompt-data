Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If there are no duplicates, all elements in the array are unique and the lengths would be equal. If there are duplicates, the set will contain fewer unique elements than the original array, making the lengths unequal. This logic works for all potential cases, so the program is correct.
