Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` uses a set to determine if there are any duplicate elements in the input list `arr`. By comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set converted from the list, the function correctly identifies whether duplicates exist. The annotation confirms that if the lengths differ, there are duplicates, and if they are the same, there are no duplicates. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks to check for any duplicate elements in the array. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements and the original assessment is correct.
