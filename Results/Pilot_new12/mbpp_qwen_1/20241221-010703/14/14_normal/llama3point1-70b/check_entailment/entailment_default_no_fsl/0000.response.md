Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the length of the array is different from the length of the set of the array. This logic is correct for identifying duplicates because if there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements than the original array. However, the problem description asks to find whether the array contains any duplicate element, which means it should return `False` only if there are no duplicates. The current implementation will return `False` even if there are no duplicates, which is not correct. It should return `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are no duplicates.

To fix this, the function should return the negation of the condition:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) > len(set(arr))
```

This corrected version will return `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are no duplicates, thus meeting the problem description for every potential case.
