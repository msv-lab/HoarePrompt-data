Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array of integers as input and checks for the presence of duplicate elements. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The function uses a set to eliminate duplicate elements from the array. Since sets cannot contain duplicates, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array if there are any duplicates.
- The expression `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` returns `True` if the lengths are not equal (indicating at least one duplicate), and `False` otherwise (indicating no duplicates).
- This logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates in the array for all possible inputs of valid lists of integers.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
