Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks for duplicates in the array by comparing the length of the array with the length of the set of the array. If there are any duplicates, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`. This approach correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array for every potential case. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as described in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
