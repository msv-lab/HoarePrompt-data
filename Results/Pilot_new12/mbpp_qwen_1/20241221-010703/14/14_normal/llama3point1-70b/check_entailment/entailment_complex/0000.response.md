Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements. It does this by comparing the length of the list `arr` with the length of a set created from the list `arr`. 

- If there are no duplicates in `arr`, all elements in the list are unique, and the length of the set (which contains only unique elements) will be equal to the length of the list. In this case, the function returns `False`.
- If there are duplicates in `arr`, the length of the set will be less than the length of the list because duplicate elements are removed when creating the set. In this case, the function returns `True`.

The comment accurately describes the logic: "The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` as a parameter and returns `True` if the number of unique elements in `arr` is less than the total number of elements in `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if there are any duplicate elements in `arr`, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`."

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid cases, the correctness is **True**.
