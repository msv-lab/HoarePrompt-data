Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` uses a set to find duplicates in the array. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, converting the array to a set will remove any duplicates. If the length of the original array is different from the length of the set, it means there were duplicates in the original array. This approach works for all potential cases where an array may contain duplicate elements or not. Therefore, the program correctly identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element in all scenarios.
