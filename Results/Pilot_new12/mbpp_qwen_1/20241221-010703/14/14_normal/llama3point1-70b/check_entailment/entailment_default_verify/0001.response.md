Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in the array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths are not equal, it indicates the presence of at least one duplicate element, hence returning `True`. If the lengths are equal, it means there are no duplicates, and it returns `False`. The output hints further confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
