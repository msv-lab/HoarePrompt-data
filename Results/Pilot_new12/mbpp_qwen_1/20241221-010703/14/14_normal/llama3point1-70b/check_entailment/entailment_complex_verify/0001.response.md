Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths are not equal, it indicates that there are duplicate elements in the array, which is exactly the behavior required by the problem description. The function does not modify the input list, which is also a valid behavior. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
