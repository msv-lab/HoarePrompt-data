Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. The annotated version of the code confirms that if the lengths are not equal, it returns `True` (indicating duplicates exist), and if they are equal, it returns `False` (indicating no duplicates). This logic aligns with the problem description and the provided annotations. Therefore, the program is correct.
