Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The logic used—converting the array to a set and comparing the lengths—ensures that duplicates are detected. Specifically, if the length of the array is different from the length of the set, it indicates the presence of at least one duplicate element. The annotated version reiterates that the function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
