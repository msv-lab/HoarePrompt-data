Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` as a parameter and returns `True` if the number of unique elements in `arr` is less than the total number of elements in `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if there are any duplicate elements in `arr`, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `arr` contains no elements (i.e., an empty list), returning `False` since the length of an empty list and its set are both 0.
- The function correctly handles the case where `arr` contains only unique elements, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `arr` contains duplicate elements, returning `True`.
- No missing functionality was identified in the provided code.
