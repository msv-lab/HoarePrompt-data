`seen` adds the value of `num` to itself. This means that `num` is now part of `seen`. The original list `arr` remains unchanged, and the program does not return anything explicitly in this snippet. The only change is that `num` is added to `seen`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus `num`, and no value has been returned.**
