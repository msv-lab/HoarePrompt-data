Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if any integer in the list is duplicated, otherwise it returns `False`. After processing the list, the function ensures that no integer is repeated more than once. If a duplicate is found during iteration, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by ensuring these scenarios do not falsely trigger a duplicate detection.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- An empty list `[]` will result in `False` being returned since there are no elements to check for duplicates.
- A list with a single element `[x]` will also result in `False` being returned because there cannot be a duplicate of a single element.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotations mention that the state of the program after the for loop includes the `seen` set containing all integers from `arr`. However, the code does not explicitly ensure this. The `seen` set will only contain unique integers encountered during the iteration, but it does not guarantee that all integers from `arr` are included if the loop completes without finding duplicates. This means the postcondition mentioning the `seen` set might be misleading unless the loop processes all elements.
