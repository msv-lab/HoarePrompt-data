According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus `num`, and no value has been returned.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next element in `arr` that will be processed. Since `num` is the last element processed in the previous iteration and `arr` is a non-empty list, there must be at least one more element left in `arr`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the current state**: 
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus the last `num`.
   - No value has been returned.

2. **Determine the next state**:
   - The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr` to process.
   - Therefore, `num` in the current state is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
   - The next `num` in the loop will be the next element in `arr`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is the last element of `arr` processed, `arr` now lacks this element.
   - `seen` should include the new `num` (the next element in `arr`).
   - No value has been returned yet.

Based on the above steps, the updated states are:

- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, missing the last `num` that was processed.
- `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus the next `num`.
- No value has been returned.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, missing the last `num` that was processed, `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus the next `num`, and no value has been returned.**
