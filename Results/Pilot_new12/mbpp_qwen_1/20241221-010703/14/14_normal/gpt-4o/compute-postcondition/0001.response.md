Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr` using the variable `num`.

2. **Determine Initial State of Variables:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `seen` is an empty set.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

4. **Initial Values for the Loop Variables:**
   - Since `num` is initialized within the loop itself (it takes on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration), we don't need to explicitly set its initial value. However, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to start executing.

5. **Ensure `arr` Contains at Least One Element:**
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the list `arr` must contain at least one integer.

### Final State:
- `arr` must be a non-empty list of integers.
- `seen` remains an empty set.

So, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`arr` must be a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is an empty set**
