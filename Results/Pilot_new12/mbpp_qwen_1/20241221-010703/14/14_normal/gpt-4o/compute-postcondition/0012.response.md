Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` was processed, and `seen` contains all elements from `arr` excluding the last element plus `num`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., the postcondition remains unchanged).***
