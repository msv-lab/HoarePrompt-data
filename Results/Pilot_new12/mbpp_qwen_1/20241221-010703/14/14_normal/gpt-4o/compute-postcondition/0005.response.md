`num` is added to the set `seen`. The set `seen` now contains all the elements it previously had plus `num`. The list `arr` and the integer `num` are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all its previous elements plus `num`, and `num` is not in `seen` (this last part is redundant since `num` has been added to `seen`).**
