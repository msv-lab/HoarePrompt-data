Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `seen` is a set containing all previous elements from `arr` plus the current `num`.
   - `num` is not in `seen` (this is redundant because `num` has already been added to `seen`).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in `arr`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since we are determining the state at the start of the next iteration, the current `num` has just been processed.

4. **Next Iteration Preparation**:
   - `num` has already been added to `seen`, so it is no longer a new element.
   - The next `num` to be processed will be the next element in the list `arr`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `arr` remains the same as it was before the loop started or has not changed during the current iteration.
   - `seen` now includes the current `num` from the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, the next `num` will be taken from `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` contains all previous elements from `arr` plus the current `num`, and the next `num` to be processed is the next element in `arr`**.
