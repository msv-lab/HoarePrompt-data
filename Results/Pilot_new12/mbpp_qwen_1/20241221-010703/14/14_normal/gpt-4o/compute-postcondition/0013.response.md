The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `seen` originally contains all elements from `arr` excluding the last element plus `num`, adding `num` to `seen` means `num` is now explicitly part of `seen`.

The output state will reflect that `num` has been added to `seen`, and no other changes occur to the variables or the precondition.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` was processed, and `seen` contains all elements from `arr` excluding the last element plus `num` with `num` explicitly added.**
