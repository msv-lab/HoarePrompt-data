Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check for the presence of duplicate elements in an array of integers. The function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of seen numbers. If a number is encountered that is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating a duplicate. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with and without duplicates, and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
