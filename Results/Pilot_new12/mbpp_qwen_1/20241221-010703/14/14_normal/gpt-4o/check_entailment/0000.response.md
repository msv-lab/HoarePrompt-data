Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements using a set to track seen numbers. The function iterates through each number in the array and checks if it has already been seen. If a duplicate is found, it returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness. Given the nature of the algorithm and the provided examples, there doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential input where this function would fail to meet the problem description.
