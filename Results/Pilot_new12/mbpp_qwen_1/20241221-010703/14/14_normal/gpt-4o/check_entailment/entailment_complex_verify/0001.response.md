Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to check for duplicates in an array of integers using a set to track seen elements. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each element in the array, checking if it has already been added to the set. If a duplicate is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `False`.

The annotated version accurately describes the states of the program and how it processes the input array. The test cases provided in the problem description are correctly implemented and cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with one duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates. These test cases confirm that the function behaves as intended.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to detect duplicates and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
