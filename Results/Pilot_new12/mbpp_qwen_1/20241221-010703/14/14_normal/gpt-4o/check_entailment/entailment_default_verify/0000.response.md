Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements using a set to track seen numbers. The function iterates through each number in the array and checks if it has already been seen. If a duplicate is found, it returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. The provided test cases confirm its correctness, and the output hints further validate that the function behaves as expected, handling various cases including edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
