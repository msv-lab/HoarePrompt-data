Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by using a set to track seen numbers. The annotated version clearly explains the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as intended. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the annotated version that would lead to the function failing to meet the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
