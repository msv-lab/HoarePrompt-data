Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function uses a set to track seen numbers and iterates through the array, returning `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with single duplicates, and arrays with multiple duplicates. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, processing the array and returning the correct boolean value based on the presence of duplicates. There are no contradictions or issues with the provided code or annotations that would necessitate a change in the original assessment.
