Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to track seen elements, which effectively checks for duplicates. The function iterates through each element in the array, checking if it has already been seen. If a duplicate is found, it immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `False`. 

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. An array with no duplicates (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
2. An array with one duplicate (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`).
3. An array with multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`).

Given these tests and the nature of the algorithm used, the function appears to handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
