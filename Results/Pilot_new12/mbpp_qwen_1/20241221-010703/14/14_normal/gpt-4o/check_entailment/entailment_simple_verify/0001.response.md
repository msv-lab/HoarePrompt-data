Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` uses a set to track seen elements, effectively checking for duplicates as it iterates through the array. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function. The function handles the problem correctly by returning `True` if any duplicate is found and `False` otherwise. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness as **True** is appropriate.
