Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies duplicates in the array using a set to track seen elements. The function iterates through each element in the array and checks if it has already been seen. If a duplicate is found, it returns `True` immediately. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list of integers and returning `True` if any integer is duplicated. The function handles edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single element by ensuring they do not falsely trigger a duplicate detection.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, one duplicate, and multiple duplicates, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
