Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array of integers as input and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements within the array. It uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the integers it has encountered so far. If it encounters an integer that is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found. If it completes the iteration over the array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first test case checks a list with unique elements, which should return `False`.
- The second test case checks a list with repeated elements (the number 4 appears twice), which should return `True`.
- The third test case checks a list with multiple repeated elements (each pair of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 appear twice), which should also return `True`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for detecting duplicates and the test cases validate its functionality, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
