The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if any integer in the list is duplicated, otherwise it returns `False`. After processing the list, the function ensures that no integer is repeated more than once. If a duplicate is found during iteration, the function immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by ensuring these scenarios do not falsely trigger a duplicate detection.
