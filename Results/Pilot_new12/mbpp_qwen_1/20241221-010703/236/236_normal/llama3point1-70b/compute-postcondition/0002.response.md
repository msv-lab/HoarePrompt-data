Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is already sorted, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list. The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty or contains a single element, as both are considered sorted. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
