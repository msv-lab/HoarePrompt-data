Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. It handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, which are considered sorted. Since the function does not modify the input list and works for all potential cases as described, the program is correct.
