Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. However, the problem description does not specify the sorting order (ascending or descending). Since the function only checks for ascending order, it fails to meet the requirements for lists that are sorted in descending order. For example, the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is sorted in descending order but the function would return `False`. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description.
