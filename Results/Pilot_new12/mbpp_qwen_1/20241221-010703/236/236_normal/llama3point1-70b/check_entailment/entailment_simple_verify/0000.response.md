Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program `func_1(nums)` checks if the list `nums` is already sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, the annotation suggests that the program returns `True` if the list is already sorted, regardless of the sorting order (ascending or descending). This annotation implies that the program is checking if the list is sorted in any order, not just ascending. Given the problem description, which asks to check if a specified list is sorted (without specifying the order), the program should work correctly for both ascending and descending orders. Since the program only checks for ascending order, it fails to meet the requirements for all possible cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
