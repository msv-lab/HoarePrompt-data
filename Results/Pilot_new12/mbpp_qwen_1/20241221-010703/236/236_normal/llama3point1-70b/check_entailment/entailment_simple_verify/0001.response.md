Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks if the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. The annotation provided also supports this understanding, stating that the program returns `True` if the list 'nums' is already sorted and `False` otherwise. This approach works for all potential cases, including lists with duplicate elements, negative numbers, zero, and lists that are already sorted or not sorted. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
