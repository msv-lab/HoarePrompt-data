Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. The annotations support this, stating that the function returns `True` if the list is already sorted and `False` otherwise. The annotations also confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which are considered sorted. Since the function behaves as intended and meets the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
