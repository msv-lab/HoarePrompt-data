Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program `func_1(nums)` checks if the list `nums` is already sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach is incorrect because it considers only the case where the list is already sorted in ascending order. However, the problem description does not specify the order; it could be sorted in either ascending or descending order. 

For example, consider the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is sorted in descending order. The program would incorrectly return `False` for this list since it is not sorted in ascending order, even though it is sorted in descending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
