Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks if the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach is correct because a list is sorted if and only if it is equal to its sorted version. This method works for all potential cases, including lists with duplicate elements, negative numbers, zero, and lists that are already sorted or not sorted. Since the function handles all these cases correctly, the program is correct.
