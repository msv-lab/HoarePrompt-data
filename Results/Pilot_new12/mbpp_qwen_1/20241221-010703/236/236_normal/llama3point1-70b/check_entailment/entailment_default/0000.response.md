Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. It returns `True` if the original list is already sorted and `False` otherwise. This approach correctly handles all potential cases:

- An empty list is considered sorted.
- A list with a single element is also considered sorted.
- A list that is already sorted in ascending order will return `True`.
- A list that is not sorted in ascending order will return `False`.

Since the function works correctly for all these cases and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
