Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and checks if it is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If the original list `nums` is equal to the sorted version of `nums`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. This approach ensures that the function correctly determines whether the input list is sorted or not, thus following the problem description accurately.
