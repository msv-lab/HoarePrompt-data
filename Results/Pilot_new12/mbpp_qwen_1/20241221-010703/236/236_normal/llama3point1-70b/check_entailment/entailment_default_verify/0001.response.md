Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the given list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element. Since the function works as expected for all mentioned cases and there is no indication of missing functionality or incorrect behavior, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
