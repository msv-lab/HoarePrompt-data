Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` meets the requirements of the problem description. It checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If both lists are identical, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach correctly identifies all cases where the list is sorted, including when the list is empty or contains a single element. Therefore, the function consistently fulfills the requirement of checking if a specified list is sorted.
