Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the program `func_1(nums)` only checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. The problem description, however, does not specify any particular order (ascending or descending), so the function should account for both possibilities. Since the provided function only checks for ascending order, it fails to meet the problem description's requirements. The output hints confirm that the function only checks for ascending order, which further supports the original assessment. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description and thus remains incorrect.
