#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #`The program returns True if the list 'nums' is already sorted, otherwise returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is already sorted, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list. The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty or contains a single element, as both are considered sorted. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
