Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code checks if a list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This logic correctly identifies if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The code handles the following cases:
- A sorted list returns `True`.
- A list that is not sorted at any point returns `False`.

Potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element are not explicitly handled in the code, but according to the problem description, these should also return `True` because there are no elements to compare that would violate the sorted condition. The provided assertions and the logic of the function itself confirm that it works correctly for these edge cases as well.

Since the code meets the requirements and works correctly for all provided examples and potential edge cases, the correctness is **True**.
