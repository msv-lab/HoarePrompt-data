Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and ensures that each element is less than or equal to the next element. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including a completely sorted list, an unsorted list, and another unsorted list, all of which are handled correctly.

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, checking for a non-decreasing sequence. While the hints mention potential edge cases like empty or single-element lists, the original problem description did not specify handling these cases explicitly. Since the function does not produce incorrect results for the given test cases, and the original assessment does not assume handling of edge cases not mentioned in the problem description, the original assessment remains accurate.
