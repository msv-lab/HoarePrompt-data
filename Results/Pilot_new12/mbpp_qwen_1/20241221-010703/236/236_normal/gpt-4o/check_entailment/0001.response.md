Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover several scenarios:
1. A completely sorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`) results in `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`) results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `20`.
3. Another unsorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`) also results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `15`.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that this function would fail to handle, the program is correct.
