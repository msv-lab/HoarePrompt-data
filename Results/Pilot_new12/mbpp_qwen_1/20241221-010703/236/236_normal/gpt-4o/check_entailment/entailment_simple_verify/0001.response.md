Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through the list and ensures that each element is less than or equal to its successor. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. A completely sorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`) results in `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`) results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `20`.
3. Another unsorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`) also results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `15`.

Given that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment is correct.
