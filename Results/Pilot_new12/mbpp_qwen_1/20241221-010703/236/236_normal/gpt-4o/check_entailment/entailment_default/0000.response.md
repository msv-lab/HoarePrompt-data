Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If any element is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the loop. This logic correctly checks if the list is non-decreasing.

Given the problem description, the function should check if the list is sorted, which means each element is less than or equal to the next element. The code provided handles this requirement correctly.

The output hints also confirm that the function checks whether the list is non-decreasing, and the provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected for both sorted and unsorted lists. The function correctly returns `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted lists.

Since the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and handles all provided test cases, the program is correct.
