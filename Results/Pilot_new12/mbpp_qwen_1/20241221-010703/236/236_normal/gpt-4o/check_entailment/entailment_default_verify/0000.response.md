Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and ensures each element is less than or equal to the next. If it finds any violation of this condition, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given assertions and handles the case where the list is non-decreasing. The function also correctly handles edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single element, returning `True` in these scenarios. Thus, the original assessment is correct.
