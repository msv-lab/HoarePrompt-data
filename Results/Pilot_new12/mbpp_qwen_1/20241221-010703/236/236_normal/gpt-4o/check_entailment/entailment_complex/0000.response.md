Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in a non-decreasing order (each element is less than or equal to its successor). The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than its successor, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding such an element, it returns `True`.

Here are some key points that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

1. **Functionality**: The function correctly implements the logic to check if the list is sorted in a non-decreasing order.
2. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where the list is empty or has only one element, returning `True` because these lists trivially satisfy the non-decreasing condition.
3. **Input Assumption**: Although the problem description does not explicitly state it, the function correctly handles the assumption that the input is a valid list (non-empty and with comparable elements), as per the given test cases.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function `func_1` behaves as expected and thus is correct.
