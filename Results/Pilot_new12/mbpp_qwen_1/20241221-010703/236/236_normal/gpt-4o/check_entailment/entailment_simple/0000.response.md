Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly checks whether a given list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- The first test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True` because the list is sorted.
- The second test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False` because the list is not sorted (the element `20` is not in the correct order).
- The third test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False` because the list is not sorted (the element `15` followed by `14` is not in the correct order).

Since the function implementation and the test cases align with the problem description, the program is correct.
