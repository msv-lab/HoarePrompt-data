Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. The annotations indicate that the function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. 

The annotated version supports the correctness of the function as follows:
- Before the function call, `lst` is assumed to be a list of comparable elements.
- After the `for` loop, `lst` is a list of comparable elements where each element is less than or equal to its successor, and `i` is `len(lst) - 2` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` is `-1`.
- The function returns `True` only if no out-of-order elements are found during the iteration.

The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function:
1. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, so the function returns `True`.
2. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted because `14 < 20` but `20 > 17`, so the function returns `False`.
3. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is not sorted because `10 < 15` but `15 > 14`, so the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
