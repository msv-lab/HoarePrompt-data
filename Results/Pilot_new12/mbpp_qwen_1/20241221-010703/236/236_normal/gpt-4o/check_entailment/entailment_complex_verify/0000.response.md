Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by iterating through the list and ensuring each element is less than or equal to the next. The annotations provided describe the state of the program accurately, showing that the function correctly checks for a non-decreasing sequence (which is equivalent to a sorted list in ascending order).

The original assessment is accurate because:
1. The function correctly identifies when a list is sorted.
2. The examples given confirm that the function works as intended.
3. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, supporting the correctness of the function.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
