Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

Given the examples provided:
1. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, so the function returns `True`.
2. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted because `14 < 20` but `20 > 17`, so the function returns `False`.
3. `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is not sorted because `10 < 15` but `15 > 14`, so the function returns `False`.

The function handles these cases correctly and appears to handle all potential cases for checking if a list is sorted. Therefore, the program is correct.
