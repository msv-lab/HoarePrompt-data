Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, showing that the function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
1. A completely sorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`) results in `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`) results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `20`.
3. Another unsorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`) also results in `False` due to the out-of-order elements `14` and `15`.

The annotations confirm that the function handles the cases where the list is empty or has only one element, returning `True` in those scenarios because there are no elements that violate the non-decreasing order condition. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
