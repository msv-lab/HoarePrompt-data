Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements where each element is less than or equal to its successor, `i` is `len(lst) - 2` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` is `-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution Condition:** The loop runs as long as there are at least two elements in the list to compare. Therefore, if the list has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute.
- **Loop Body:** The loop checks if the current element (`lst[i]`) is greater than the next element (`lst[i + 1]`). If it finds an element that is greater, it immediately returns `False`.
- **Post-Loop State:**
  - If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, it means every element is less than or equal to its successor. Hence, the function does not return anything (returns `None`).
  - If the loop finds an element that violates the condition (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it returns `False` and the loop terminates early.
  
Since the loop does not modify the list directly within itself, the list remains unchanged after the loop execution. The value of `i` indicates whether the loop completed (with `i` being `len(lst) - 2`) or was terminated early (by returning `False`).

Thus, the final state of the list and the index `i` is described as above.
