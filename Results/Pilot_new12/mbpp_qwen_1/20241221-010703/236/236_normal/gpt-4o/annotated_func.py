#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements where each element is less than or equal to its successor, `i` is `len(lst) - 2` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` is `-1`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds any element that is greater than its successor, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, it returns `True`. This means the function checks whether the list is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next). Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with a single element, which would both return `True` since there are no elements that violate the condition. The function does not handle lists that are empty or have only one element; it assumes the list has at least two elements.
