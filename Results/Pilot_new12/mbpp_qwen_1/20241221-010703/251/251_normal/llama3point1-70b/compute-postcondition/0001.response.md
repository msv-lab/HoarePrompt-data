`phi` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian coordinate system. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\); `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`**
