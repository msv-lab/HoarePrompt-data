The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the Euclidean norm (or vector magnitude) of the point (x, y), which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). This value is assigned to the variable `r`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)**
