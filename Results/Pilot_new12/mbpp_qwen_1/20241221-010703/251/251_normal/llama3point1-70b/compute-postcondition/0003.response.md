The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, the function returns `r` which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and `phi` which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `phi` in radians.
