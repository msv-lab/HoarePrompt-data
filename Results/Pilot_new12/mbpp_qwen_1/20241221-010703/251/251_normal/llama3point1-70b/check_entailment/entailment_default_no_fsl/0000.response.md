Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. When `x` and `y` are both zero, `math.atan2(y, x)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because `atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. The code should include a check to handle this case, either by returning a specific value or raising an appropriate exception. Since the code does not address this scenario, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
