Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem description asks for a function that converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, which involves handling all standard cases. However, the program does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. When `x` and `y` are both zero, `math.atan2(y, x)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. 

To make the program correct, the function should include a check to handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. For example, it could return a specific value (like `(0, 0)`) or raise an exception indicating that the input is invalid. Here is an example of how the function could be modified to handle this case:

```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        return 0, 0  # or raise an exception: raise ValueError("Input coordinates cannot both be zero")
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
```

By including this check, the function ensures that it can handle all possible cases of input, thus meeting the problem description.
