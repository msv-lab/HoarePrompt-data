Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which corresponds to the radial coordinate \( r \). The `math.atan2(y, x)` function calculates the angle φ between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point (x, y), which handles all quadrants correctly. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
