Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. When `x` and `y` are both zero, `math.atan2(y, x)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because `atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. According to the problem description, the function should handle all standard cases where `x` and `y` are real numbers. Since the code fails to handle this specific case, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
