Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for most cases, it does not handle the special case where both `x` and `y` are zero. According to the output hints, the function should include a check for this scenario to avoid a `ZeroDivisionError`. Since the original assessment did not account for this edge case, it is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the program's correctness should be marked as False until this edge case is addressed.
