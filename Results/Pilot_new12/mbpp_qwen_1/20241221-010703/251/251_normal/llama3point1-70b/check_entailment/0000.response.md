Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The formula used for the radius \( r \) is \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is implemented using `math.hypot(x, y)`. The formula for the angle \( \phi \) is \( \phi = \arctan2(y, x) \), which is correctly implemented using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This function handles all cases, including when \( x \) is zero, without any issues. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
