Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the radial coordinate \( r \) using `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle \( \phi \) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. Both of these functions handle all potential cases, including different quadrants. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program, indicating that `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). Therefore, the function meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
