Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the polar coordinates for valid inputs, the annotated version highlights a critical edge case that was not considered in the original assessment. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. When both `x` and `y` are zero, `math.atan2(y, x)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function should include a check for this scenario to avoid the error or handle it appropriately. Since the original assessment did not account for this potential error, the overall correctness of the function cannot be fully validated without addressing this issue.
