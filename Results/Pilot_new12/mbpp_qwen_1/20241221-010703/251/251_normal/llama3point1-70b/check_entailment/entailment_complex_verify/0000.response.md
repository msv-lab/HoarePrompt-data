Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is based on the assumption that the function handles all cases correctly. However, the annotated version reveals that the function does not explicitly handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. When both `x` and `y` are zero, `math.atan2(y, x)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` because `atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. Since the function does not include error handling for this specific case, it is not fully robust and does not meet the problem description as accurately as it could. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this oversight.
