Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The function `func_1` computes the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) via `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle \( \phi \) using the formula \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \) via `math.atan2(y, x)`. 

- `math.hypot(x, y)` returns the Euclidean norm of the vector (x, y), which is equivalent to \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
- `math.atan2(y, x)` returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y), handling all quadrants correctly.

Since the program accurately implements the required conversion and handles all possible inputs within the constraints of the problem description (assuming valid input), the program is correct.
