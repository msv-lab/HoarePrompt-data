Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. While the function does correctly implement the conversion using `math.hypot(x, y)` for the radius `r` and `math.atan2(y, x)` for the angle `phi`, it does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. In such a scenario, `math.atan2(y, x)` would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. According to the output hints, the function should include a check to handle this case. Since the function does not account for this edge case, the original assessment cannot be considered accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
