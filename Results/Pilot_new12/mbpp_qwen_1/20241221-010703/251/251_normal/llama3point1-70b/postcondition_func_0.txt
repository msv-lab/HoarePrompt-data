The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It calculates the distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), and the angle `phi` in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. The function returns these two values, `r` and `phi`.

The function handles all standard cases where `x` and `y` are real numbers. However, it does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. In such a scenario, `math.atan2(y, x)` would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because `atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. To account for this, the function should include a check to handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero by returning a specific value or raising an exception, as appropriate.
