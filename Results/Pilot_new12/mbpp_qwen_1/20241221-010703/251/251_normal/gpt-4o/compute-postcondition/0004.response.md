Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point, given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), and the angle `theta` as the angle formed between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point, measured in radians using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. The function returns these two values, `r` and `theta`, which represent the polar coordinates of the point. The function handles the case where `x` and `y` can be any real numbers, including zero and negative values. However, it does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, as `math.atan2(0, 0)` would raise an error due to division by zero. In such a case, the function should either return a specific value (like `(0, 0)`) or handle this edge case explicitly.**
