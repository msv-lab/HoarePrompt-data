The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. The function returns `r`, which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), and `theta`, which is \(\mathit{math.atan2}(y, x)\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the radius `r` and angle `theta` in polar coordinates.
