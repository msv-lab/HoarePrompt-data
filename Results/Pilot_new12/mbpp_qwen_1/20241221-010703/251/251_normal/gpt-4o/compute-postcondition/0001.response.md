The code assigns the value of `math.atan2(y, x)` to the variable `theta`. The function `math.atan2(y, x)` returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. This angle is the arctangent of `y/x`, taking into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant.

Given the initial state where `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and `r` is calculated as \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), the variable `theta` is updated to the angle corresponding to the coordinates `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\); `theta` is \(\mathit{math.atan2}(y, x)\)**
