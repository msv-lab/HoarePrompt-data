Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The annotations confirm that the program first calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and then calculates the angle \( \theta \) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function returns the expected results for different sets of input coordinates, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
