Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). 

- The function correctly calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
- It also correctly calculates the angle \( \theta \) using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which takes into account the signs of both x and y to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

The test cases provided in the assertions verify that the function works as expected for different sets of input values. Since the program handles the conversion correctly according to the mathematical definitions and the test cases confirm its accuracy, the program is correct in fulfilling the given problem description.
