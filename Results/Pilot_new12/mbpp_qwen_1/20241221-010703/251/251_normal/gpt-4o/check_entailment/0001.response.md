Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` calculates the radius `r` using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`.

The provided test cases:
1. `func_1(3, 4)` returns `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`
2. `func_1(4, 7)` returns `(8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)`
3. `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)`

All these test cases are correct according to the mathematical definitions of polar coordinates. Additionally, `math.atan2(y, x)` correctly handles the quadrant determination, ensuring accurate results for points in all four quadrants. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description and the provided test cases cover typical scenarios, we can conclude that the program is correct.
