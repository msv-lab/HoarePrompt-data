Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Specifically, the function calculates the radius `r` using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles all four quadrants appropriately. The provided test cases also align with the expected outcomes based on the mathematical definitions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
