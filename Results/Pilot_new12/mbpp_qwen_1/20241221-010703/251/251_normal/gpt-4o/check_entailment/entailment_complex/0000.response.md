Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are expected to be real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates of a point.

2. **Radius Calculation**: The radius `r` is calculated as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point using the formula \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). This is correctly implemented using `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle `theta` is calculated as the angle formed between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point, measured in radians using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. This handles the correct quadrant placement of the angle, which is crucial for accurate polar coordinate representation.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns the tuple `(r, theta)` containing the radius and the angle, which are the polar coordinates of the point.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: Although the problem description mentions that the function should handle the case where `x` and `y` can be zero or negative values, it does not specifically mention handling the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. Since the provided assertions cover various cases (including non-zero values), and the function correctly computes the polar coordinates for all tested cases, the function is considered correct under the given assumptions.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for the given test cases.
