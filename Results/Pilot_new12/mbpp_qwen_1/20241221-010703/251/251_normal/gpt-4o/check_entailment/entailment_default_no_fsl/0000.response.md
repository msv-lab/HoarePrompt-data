Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. According to the output hints, `math.atan2(0, 0)` would raise an error due to division by zero. To handle this case, the function should either return a specific value (like `(0, 0)`) or explicitly manage this edge case. Since the function does not handle this situation, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
