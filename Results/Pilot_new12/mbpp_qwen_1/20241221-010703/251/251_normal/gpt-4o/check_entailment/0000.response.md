Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). The formula used for the radius \( r \) is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the angle \( \theta \) is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y).

The provided test cases demonstrate the conversion for different sets of coordinates, and the results match the expected values. Since the function uses the correct mathematical formulas and handles the conversion accurately for the given examples, we can conclude that the program works correctly for the described task.
