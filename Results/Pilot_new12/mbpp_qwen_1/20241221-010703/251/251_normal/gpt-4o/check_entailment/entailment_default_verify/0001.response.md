Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct without considering the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero. According to the output hints, the function `func_1` does not handle this specific edge case. When `x` and `y` are both zero, `math.atan2(0, 0)` raises an error due to division by zero. The function should either return a specific value (like `(0, 0)`) or handle this edge case explicitly to ensure full correctness. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this oversight.
