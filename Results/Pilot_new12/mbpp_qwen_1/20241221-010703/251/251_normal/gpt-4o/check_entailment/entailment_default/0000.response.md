Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \theta = \text{math.atan2}(y, x) \). However, the problem description mentions that the function should handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, which would result in an error due to division by zero in the calculation of `math.atan2(0, 0)`. The output hints also indicate this issue, suggesting that the function should either return a specific value (like `(0, 0)`) or handle this edge case explicitly. Since the current implementation does not address this edge case, the function is incorrect for the given problem description.
