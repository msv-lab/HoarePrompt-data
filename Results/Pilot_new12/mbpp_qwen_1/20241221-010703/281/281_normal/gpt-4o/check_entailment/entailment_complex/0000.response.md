Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and includes it in the result if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).
3. The function returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
4. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even or odd numbers, and an empty list.

Since the function `func_1` meets the problem description for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
