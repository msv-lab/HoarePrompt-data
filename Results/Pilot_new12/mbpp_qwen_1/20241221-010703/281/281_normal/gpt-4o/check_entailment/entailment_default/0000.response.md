Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The code uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. Given the examples and the output hints, the function works correctly for all provided cases. The function handles an empty list by returning an empty list, and it correctly filters out the even numbers without modifying the original list. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
