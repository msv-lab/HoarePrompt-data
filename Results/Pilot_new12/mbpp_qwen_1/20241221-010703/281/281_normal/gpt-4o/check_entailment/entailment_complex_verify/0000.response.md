Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if it is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This logic is accurate and will handle all potential cases where the input list contains integers. The provided assertions also correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function, confirming its correctness. The annotated version supports the original assessment by accurately describing the behavior of the function and its handling of different input scenarios, including empty lists. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
