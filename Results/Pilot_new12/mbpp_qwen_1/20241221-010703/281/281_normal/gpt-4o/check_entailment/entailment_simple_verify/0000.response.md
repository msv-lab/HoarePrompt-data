Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list. The annotated version supports this by indicating that the function processes a list of integers and returns a list of even numbers. The examples given in the assertions also correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
