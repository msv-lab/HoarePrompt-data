Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, filtering even numbers without modifying the original list. The function handles an empty input list by returning an empty list, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no discrepancies between the problem description, the code, and the output hints that would indicate the program is incorrect.
