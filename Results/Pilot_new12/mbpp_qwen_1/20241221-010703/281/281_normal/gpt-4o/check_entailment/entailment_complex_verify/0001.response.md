Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers. The annotations provided support this understanding, stating that the function takes a list of integers, filters out the even numbers, and returns a new list containing only those even numbers. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct lists of even numbers for the given inputs. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that suggest the function is incorrect, and the function handles an empty input list by returning an empty list. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
