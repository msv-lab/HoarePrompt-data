Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out the even numbers by checking if each number (`num`) modulo 2 equals 0. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
