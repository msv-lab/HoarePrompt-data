Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the program. The provided function `func_1` accurately filters even numbers from a list as per the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each number in the input list and returns a new list containing only the even numbers, which matches the problem description. The test cases provided in the annotations validate the function's correctness. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
