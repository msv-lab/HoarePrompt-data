Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list and checks if it is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This logic is correct and will handle all potential cases where the input list contains integers, both positive and negative. The examples given also correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
