Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters even numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). The function handles various cases, including an empty list, and returns the expected results as shown in the assertions. Therefore, the code appears to meet the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints.
