Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers and returns a new list containing only those even numbers. The provided output hints confirm that the function works as intended, handling both non-empty and empty lists appropriately. The function does not modify the original list, creating a new list with the filtered results. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds even numbers from a list, and the function `func_1` meets this requirement without any issues, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
