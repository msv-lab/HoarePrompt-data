Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the result if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). Based on the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which is correct.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which is correct.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which is correct.

Given that the function behaves as expected in the provided cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct for the described task. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the provided information.
