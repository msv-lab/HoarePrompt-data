#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even numbers from the original list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It filters out the even numbers from the original list and returns a new list containing only those even numbers. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly handles an empty input list by returning an empty list. The function does not modify the original list; it creates a new list containing the filtered even numbers.
