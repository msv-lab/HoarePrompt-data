Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). This logic covers all potential cases where the input is a list of integers. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
