Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out odd numbers and retains only the even ones, which aligns with the problem description of finding even numbers from a list of numbers. Since the program handles all potential valid inputs (lists of integers) and produces the expected output without any edge cases or missing functionalities, it is correct according to the given problem description.
