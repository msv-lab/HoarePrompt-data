Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list of numbers. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list and checks if it is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This logic correctly filters out all odd numbers, leaving only even numbers in the resulting list. Since the program meets the requirements for all potential cases, it is correct.
