Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` iterates over each number in the input list `numbers` and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This ensures that the function always produces a list of even numbers from the input list, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
