Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly filters and returns only the even numbers from the input list. The list comprehension iterates over each element in the input list `numbers` and applies the condition `num % 2 == 0` to check if the number is even. The annotated version confirms that the program behaves as expected, returning a list of even numbers. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
