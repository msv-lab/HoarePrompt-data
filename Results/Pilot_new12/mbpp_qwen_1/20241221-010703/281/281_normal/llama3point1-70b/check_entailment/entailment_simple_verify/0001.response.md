Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the input list `numbers`, checks each number using the condition `num % 2 == 0` to filter out even numbers, and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a list of integers), the function is expected to work as intended under these conditions. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
