Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension. The output hints confirm that the function correctly filters out odd numbers and retains only the even ones. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function handles all expected cases as per the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
