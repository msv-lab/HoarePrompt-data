Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers and retains only the even ones from the input list. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). Given the problem description to find even numbers from a list of numbers, this implementation satisfies the requirements for every potential case, assuming valid input as specified.
