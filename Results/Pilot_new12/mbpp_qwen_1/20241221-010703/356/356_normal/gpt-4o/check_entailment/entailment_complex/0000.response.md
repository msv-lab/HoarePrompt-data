Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all whitespace characters removed using the `replace` method. The assertions provided in the comments demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various input cases, including strings with leading and trailing spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces. Since the function removes all whitespace characters and handles edge cases like empty strings appropriately, it fulfills the requirement of the problem description.
