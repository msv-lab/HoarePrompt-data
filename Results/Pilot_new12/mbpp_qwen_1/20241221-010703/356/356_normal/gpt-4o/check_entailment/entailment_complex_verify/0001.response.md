Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string in all the given test cases. The annotations further clarify that the function uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of space characters from the input string `s`, resulting in a new string with no spaces. The annotations also mention potential edge cases such as empty strings or strings that do not contain any spaces, in which case the function returns the original string. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the program is indeed correct.
