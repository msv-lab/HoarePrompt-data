Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string. The program includes several assertions that test various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing whitespaces. 

The function `func_1(s)` uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of a space (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing all whitespaces from the input string `s`. Since the assertions pass for the given test cases, the program correctly removes all whitespaces from the input strings, thus satisfying the problem description.
