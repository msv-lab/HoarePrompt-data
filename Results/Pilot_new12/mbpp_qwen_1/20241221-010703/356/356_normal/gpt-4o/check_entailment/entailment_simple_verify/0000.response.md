Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string, which meets the problem description of removing all whitespaces. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly processes the string before returning it without any spaces. The provided test cases in the assertions cover various scenarios including leading, trailing, and multiple spaces, and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
