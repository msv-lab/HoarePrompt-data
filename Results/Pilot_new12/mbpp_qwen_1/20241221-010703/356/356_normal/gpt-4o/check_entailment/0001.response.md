Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string in all the given test cases. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of whitespace characters with an empty string, which is the correct approach for this problem. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the program appears to be correct.
