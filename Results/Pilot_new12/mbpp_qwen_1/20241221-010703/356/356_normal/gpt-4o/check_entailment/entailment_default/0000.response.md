Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string. The `replace` method is used to replace all occurrences of space characters (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing them. The provided assertions cover various cases including strings with multiple spaces, leading spaces, and trailing spaces. Given that the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios and the problem description is straightforward (remove all whitespaces), we can conclude that the function works correctly for every potential case.
