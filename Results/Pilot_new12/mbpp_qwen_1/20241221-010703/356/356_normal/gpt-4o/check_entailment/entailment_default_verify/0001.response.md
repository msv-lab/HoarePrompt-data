Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string using the `replace` method. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected by removing all spaces and handling potential edge cases like empty strings or strings without any spaces. The function passes all the provided test cases and the description of the problem matches the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
