Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters (including spaces) from the input string using the `replace` method. The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including leading, trailing, and multiple spaces within the string. The assertions given in the problem description also validate that the function works as expected for these cases. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
