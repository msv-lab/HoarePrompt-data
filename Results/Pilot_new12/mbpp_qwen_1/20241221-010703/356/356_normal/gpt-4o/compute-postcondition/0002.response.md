Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. The function performs the following actions: it uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of space characters (' ') from the input string `s`. This transformation results in a new string with no spaces. Potential edge cases include empty strings or strings that already do not contain any spaces, in which case the function simply returns the original string. There is no missing functionality; the code accurately removes all spaces from the input string as intended.**
