Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` as input and uses the `replace` method to remove all spaces from the string. This precisely fulfills the requirement of removing all whitespaces from a string. The function handles all valid cases of input strings, including those that are empty or consist solely of spaces, resulting in an empty string as expected. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the function fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
