Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string using the `replace` method. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various cases such as empty strings and strings consisting solely of spaces. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
