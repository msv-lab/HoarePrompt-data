Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. Since the `replace` method removes all occurrences of the specified substring (in this case, a space), the function satisfies the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
