Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. This approach correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases, as the `replace` method will replace all occurrences of the space character (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespace. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
