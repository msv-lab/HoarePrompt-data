Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the program. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespaces from the input string, which aligns with the problem description of removing all whitespaces. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling potential edge cases such as empty strings or strings consisting solely of spaces. Since the program meets the requirements and the output hints support its correctness, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
