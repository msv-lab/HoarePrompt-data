Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a string `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. The annotations also address potential edge cases such as empty strings or strings consisting solely of spaces, noting that these would still result in an empty string upon removal of spaces. Given that the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
