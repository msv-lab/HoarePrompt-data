Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace from the input string using the `replace` method. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as empty strings or strings consisting solely of spaces, resulting in an empty string. The provided code does not miss any functionality necessary to fulfill the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the function.
