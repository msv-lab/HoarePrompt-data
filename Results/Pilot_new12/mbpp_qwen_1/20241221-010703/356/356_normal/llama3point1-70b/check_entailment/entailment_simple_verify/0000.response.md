Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function operates as expected, returning the input string without any spaces. Since the problem description requires removing all whitespaces from a string, and the function fulfills this requirement, the program is correct.
