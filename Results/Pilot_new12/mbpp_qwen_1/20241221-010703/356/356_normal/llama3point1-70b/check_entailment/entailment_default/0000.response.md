Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string. The `replace` method is used to replace all occurrences of spaces with an empty string, which achieves the desired outcome. The function works for all potential cases, including edge cases such as empty strings or strings consisting solely of spaces, which would still result in an empty string after removing spaces. The code strictly adheres to the problem description and handles all valid inputs as expected.
