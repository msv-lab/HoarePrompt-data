Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespace from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, returning the input string without any spaces. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function handles the removal of whitespace effectively, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
