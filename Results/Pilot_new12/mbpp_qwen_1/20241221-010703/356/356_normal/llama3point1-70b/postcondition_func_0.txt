The function `func_1` accepts a string `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. The function performs this action by using the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of spaces in the input string. This process effectively results in a string where all spaces have been eliminated. Potential edge cases include empty strings or strings consisting solely of spaces, which would still result in an empty string upon removal of spaces. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the intended behavior.
