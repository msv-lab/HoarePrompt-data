Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. Based on the provided assertions, the function works correctly for the given examples. Since there is no indication of edge cases or scenarios where the function might fail (such as empty strings, strings with leading/trailing underscores, or strings with multiple consecutive underscores), and the function behaves as expected for the given examples, the program is correct.
