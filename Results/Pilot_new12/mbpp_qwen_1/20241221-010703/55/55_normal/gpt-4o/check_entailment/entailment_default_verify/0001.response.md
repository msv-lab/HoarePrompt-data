Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts snake case strings to camel case strings accurately. The provided code logic, which splits the string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together, aligns with the problem description and the output hints. The function handles the cases where the input string is an empty string or a single word without underscores. Additionally, the function assumes the input is correctly formatted, which is a reasonable assumption based on the given context. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
