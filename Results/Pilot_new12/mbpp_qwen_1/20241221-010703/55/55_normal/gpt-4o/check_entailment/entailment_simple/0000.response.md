Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. Here’s why:

1. **Function Name and Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `snake_str`, which is a string formatted in snake_case. This matches the expected input described in the problem statement.

2. **Logic**: 
   - The function splits the `snake_str` into components using the underscore (`_`) as the delimiter. This step correctly identifies individual words in the snake_case string.
   - Each component is then capitalized using the `capitalize()` method, ensuring the first letter is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
   - These capitalized components are joined together without any separators, resulting in a string in camelCase format.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions check the function with three different inputs, confirming the following:
   - `'python_program'` → `'PythonProgram'`
   - `'python_language'` → `'PythonLanguage'`
   - `'programming_language'` → `'ProgrammingLanguage'`

These test cases cover various scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for snake case strings. Since the function correctly implements the logic to convert snake case to camel case for all tested examples, and there is no indication that it fails for other valid snake case strings, the program is correct according to the problem description.
