Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a snake case string (consisting of lowercase letters and underscores) and converts it to camel case by capitalizing the first letter of each component (word) separated by underscores and joining them together without any separators.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty String**: The function handles an empty string correctly by returning an empty string.
   - **Single Word**: If there are no underscores in the input string, the function correctly capitalizes the entire string.
   - **Correct Format**: The function assumes that the input string is correctly formatted with lowercase letters and underscores. It does not handle other characters or formatting issues, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios:
   - `'python_program'` -> `'PythonProgram'`
   - `'python_language'` -> `'PythonLanguage'`
   - `'programming_language'` -> `'ProgrammingLanguage'`

4. **Code Implementation**: 
   - The line `components = snake_str.split('_')` splits the string at each underscore, resulting in a list of words.
   - The line `return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)` capitalizes each word in the list and joins them together without any separators.

Since the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles the specified edge cases as per the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is `Correctness: True`.
