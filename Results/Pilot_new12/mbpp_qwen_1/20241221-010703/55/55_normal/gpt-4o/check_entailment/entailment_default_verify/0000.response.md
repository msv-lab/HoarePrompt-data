Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts snake case strings to camel case strings as intended. The provided output hints and the function's behavior confirm that it splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. The potential edge cases mentioned (empty string, single word without underscores) are handled appropriately by the function, and there is no indication that the function fails under these conditions. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided information, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate.
