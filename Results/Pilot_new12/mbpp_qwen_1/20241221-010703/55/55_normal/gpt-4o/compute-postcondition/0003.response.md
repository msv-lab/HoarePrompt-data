Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `snake_str`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores. It splits `snake_str` into components based on the underscores, capitalizes each component, and then joins them together without any separators. The function returns a new string where each component (word) from `snake_str` is capitalized and joined together without any separators. 

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If `snake_str` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string.
- If `snake_str` contains no underscores (i.e., it is a single word), the function will capitalize the entire word and return it.
- The function assumes that `snake_str` is correctly formatted with lowercase letters and underscores; it does not handle other characters or formatting issues.**

Note: The provided annotations are accurate and complete for the given code. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases that need to be added based on the current code.
