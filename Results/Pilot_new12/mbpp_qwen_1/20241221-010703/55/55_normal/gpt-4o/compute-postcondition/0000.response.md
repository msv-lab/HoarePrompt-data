The code `components = snake_str.split('_')` splits the string `snake_str` at each underscore ('_') and assigns the resulting list to the variable `components`. Since `snake_str` contains only lowercase letters and underscores, the split operation will create a list of strings without underscores.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores; `components` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_str` at each underscore.**
