#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #`The program returns a string formed by capitalizing each word from the list 'words' and joining them without any underscores
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_case_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores. It splits this string into words using underscores as delimiters, capitalizes each word, and then joins these words together without any underscores to form a new string. The function returns this new string. Potential edge cases include an empty string or a string with no underscores, in which case the returned string would be the original input without any modifications. The function does not handle uppercase letters or other characters outside of lowercase letters and underscores, so if such characters are present, they will not be modified.
