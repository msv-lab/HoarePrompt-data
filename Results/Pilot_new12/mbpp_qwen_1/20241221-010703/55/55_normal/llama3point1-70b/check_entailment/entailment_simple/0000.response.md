Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string as per the problem description. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string in snake case format (containing only lowercase letters and underscores).
- Inside the function, `snake_case_str.split('_')` splits the input string into a list of words separated by underscores.
- The list comprehension `word.capitalize() for word in words` capitalizes the first letter of each word in the list.
- Finally, `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` joins these capitalized words together without any underscores, resulting in a camel case string.
- The function then returns this camel case string.

Since the program performs all the necessary steps to convert a snake case string to a camel case string, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
