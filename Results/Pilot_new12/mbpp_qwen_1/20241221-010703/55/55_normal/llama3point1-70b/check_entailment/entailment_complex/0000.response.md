Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `snake_case_str` that consists only of lowercase letters and underscores, splits it into words using the underscore as a delimiter, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then joins these words together without any underscores to form a camel case string. The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description:

- If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty string as there are no underscores to split on.
- If the input string contains no underscores, the function will simply capitalize each character (though the problem description implies the string should contain underscores, this case is still handled correctly).

The provided code accurately performs the transformation from snake case to camel case as required, making the program correct according to the problem description.
