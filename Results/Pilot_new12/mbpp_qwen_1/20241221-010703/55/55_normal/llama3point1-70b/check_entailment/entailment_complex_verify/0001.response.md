Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string under the given constraints and assumptions. The annotations confirm that the function handles all valid snake case strings, including edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no underscores. The function does not handle uppercase letters or other characters outside of lowercase letters and underscores, but this aligns with the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
