Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all potential cases. It splits the input string by underscores and capitalizes each word except the first one. This approach handles all valid snake case strings, including those with multiple underscores, empty strings, and strings with no underscores. There are no edge cases that this function does not handle correctly based on the problem description.
