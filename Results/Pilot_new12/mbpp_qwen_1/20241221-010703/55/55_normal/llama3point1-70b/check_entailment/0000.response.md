Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without any additional characters. This logic handles all potential cases, including strings with multiple underscores, leading/trailing underscores, and empty strings. There are no obvious edge cases or examples where this function would fail based on the problem description.
