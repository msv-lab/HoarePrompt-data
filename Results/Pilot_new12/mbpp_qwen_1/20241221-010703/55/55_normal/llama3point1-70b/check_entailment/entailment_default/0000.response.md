Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and then joins them together without any underscores. This matches the problem description and handles all potential cases, including an empty string or a string with no underscores, where the returned string remains unchanged. The code does not handle uppercase letters or other characters outside of lowercase letters and underscores, but this is not required according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case described.
