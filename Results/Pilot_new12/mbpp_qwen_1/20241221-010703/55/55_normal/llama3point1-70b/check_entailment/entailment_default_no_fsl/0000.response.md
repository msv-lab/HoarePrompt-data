Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It handles the splitting of the string by underscores, capitalizing each word, and joining them back together. The function works correctly for all described cases, including edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no underscores. The function does not modify uppercase letters or other characters outside of lowercase letters and underscores, which aligns with the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case specified.
