The code `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` joins the capitalized words from the `words` list into a single string without any separators. This transformation changes the `snake_case_str` into a `camelCaseStr`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
2. `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by underscores.
3. The code iterates over each word in `words`, capitalizes each word using `word.capitalize()`, and then joins these capitalized words together without any separator.

Therefore, the `camel_case_str` is created by joining the capitalized words from `words`.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by underscores; `camel_case_str` is the string formed by joining the capitalized words from `words`.**
