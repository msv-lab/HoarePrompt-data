The `split` method is called on `snake_case_str` with the delimiter `_`. This splits the string into a list of substrings based on the underscore delimiter. The original string `snake_case_str` is transformed into a list of words without the underscores. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by underscores.**
