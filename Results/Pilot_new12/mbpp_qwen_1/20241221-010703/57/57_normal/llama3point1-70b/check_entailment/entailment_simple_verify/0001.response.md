Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a list of sorted sublists where each element is sorted in ascending order, ignoring case sensitivity. There are no missing logic or edge cases that would make the program incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
