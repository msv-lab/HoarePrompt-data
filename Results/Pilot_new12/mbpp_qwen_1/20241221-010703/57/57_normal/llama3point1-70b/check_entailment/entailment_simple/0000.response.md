Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a new list where each sublist has been sorted in ascending order, ignoring case sensitivity.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid input, specifically a list of lists where each element of the inner lists is a string. The program does not explicitly validate this, but since the problem description states we should assume valid input, the function can proceed without such checks.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive because `str.lower` converts all characters to lowercase before comparing them during the sort process.

3. **Output**: The result is a new list of sorted sublists, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality without any deviations or additional unnecessary operations, it meets the requirements as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
