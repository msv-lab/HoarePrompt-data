Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using a case-insensitive key (`key=str.lower`). This approach ensures that the sorting is done in a way that is consistent with the problem description, regardless of the case of the string elements. Since the function handles all sublists correctly and follows the requirement without any missing logic or edge cases, it can be considered correct for all potential cases.
