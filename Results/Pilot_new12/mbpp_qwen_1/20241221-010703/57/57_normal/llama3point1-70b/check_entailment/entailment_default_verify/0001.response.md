Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner using `key=str.lower`. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, sorting the strings within each sublist in ascending order without considering case sensitivity. Since the function handles all sublists correctly and follows the requirement without any missing logic or edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
