Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order ignoring case sensitivity. The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. There are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, and the provided solution should work correctly for any valid input list of lists containing strings.
