Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner using `key=str.lower`. The annotations confirm that the function processes each sublist in the input list of lists and returns a new list of sorted sublists, adhering to the problem description. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the annotations that would suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is justified.
