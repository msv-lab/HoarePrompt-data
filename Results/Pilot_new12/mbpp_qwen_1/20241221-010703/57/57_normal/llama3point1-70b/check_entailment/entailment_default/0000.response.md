Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each element of the inner lists is a string and returns a new list containing sorted sublists, where each element within these sublists is sorted in ascending order ignoring case sensitivity. The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to handle all potential cases appropriately. There are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, and the code seems to meet the requirements for sorting each sublist of strings.
