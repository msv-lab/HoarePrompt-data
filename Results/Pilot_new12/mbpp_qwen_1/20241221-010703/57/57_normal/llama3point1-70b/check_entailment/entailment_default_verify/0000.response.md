Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using a list comprehension and the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower`. The output hints confirm that the function handles case-insensitive sorting for all elements within the sublists, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that require special handling. The program meets the problem description of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
