Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and sorts them using `sorted()` with `key=str.lower` to ensure case-insensitive sorting. This approach works for all potential cases as it handles sublists of varying lengths and containing different types of string values. There are no edge cases or special scenarios mentioned in the problem description that this implementation fails to handle.
