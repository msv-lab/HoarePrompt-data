Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each element is a string. This matches the expected input as per the problem description.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to create a new list where each sublist is sorted using the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower`. The `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase characters are compared in a way that treats 'A' and 'a' as equal during the sorting process. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list containing the sorted sublists, which again aligns perfectly with the problem description stating that the function should return a list of sorted sublists.

Given these points, the program is designed to meet the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs, making it correct.
