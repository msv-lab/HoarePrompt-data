Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The annotation states that the function returns a list of sorted sublists where each element is sorted in ascending order ignoring case sensitivity, which aligns with the use of `key=str.lower` in the `sorted` function. The annotations also indicate that there are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, and the provided code handles sublists of varying lengths and containing different types of string values correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
