The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each element of the inner lists is a string. It returns a new list containing sorted sublists, where each element within these sublists is sorted in ascending order ignoring case sensitivity. This means that both uppercase and lowercase characters are compared in a case-insensitive manner during the sorting process. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need special handling, as the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` should handle strings correctly.
