Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order, and it does not modify the original lists. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including sublists with duplicate elements and sublists with leading/trailing spaces. Since the function behaves as expected and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases beyond those covered by the examples, the original assessment of correctness being True is justified.
