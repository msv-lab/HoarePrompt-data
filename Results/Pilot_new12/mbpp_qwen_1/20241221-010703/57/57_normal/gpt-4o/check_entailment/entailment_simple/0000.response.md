Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains strings) as input and returns a new list of lists with each inner list sorted in ascending order.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be a valid list of lists containing strings. The program does not explicitly check for this validity, but since the problem statement indicates that we should assume valid inputs, the program is correct under this assumption.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and applies the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist. The result is a new list of sorted sublists.

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, the output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`.
   - For the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`, the output is `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`.
   - For the input `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])`, the output is `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

In all these cases, the program correctly sorts each sublist of strings.

Since the program consistently performs the required operation of sorting each sublist of strings, it adheres to the problem description, and thus the correctness is **True**.
