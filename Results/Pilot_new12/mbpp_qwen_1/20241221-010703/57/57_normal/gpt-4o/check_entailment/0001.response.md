Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted()` function is used to sort each sublist, and a list comprehension is used to apply this sorting to all sublists. The provided test cases cover different scenarios including sublists with duplicate elements and sublists with leading/trailing spaces. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that are not covered by the examples, we can conclude that the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
