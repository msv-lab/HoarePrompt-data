Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and apply the `sorted` function to sort the elements within the sublist. The assertions provided in the task also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles the sorting correctly for the provided examples and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem description in all tested scenarios.
