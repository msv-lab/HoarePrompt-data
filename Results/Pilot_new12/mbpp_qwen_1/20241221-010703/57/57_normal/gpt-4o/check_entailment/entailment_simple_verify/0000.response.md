Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each sublist individually and sorts its elements, which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions further validate the function's correctness by demonstrating that it handles various cases properly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is justified.
