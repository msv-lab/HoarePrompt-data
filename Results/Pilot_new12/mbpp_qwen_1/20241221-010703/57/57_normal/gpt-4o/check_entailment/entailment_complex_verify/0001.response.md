Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each sublist independently and returns a new list with sorted sublists, without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. The function handles edge cases such as empty sublists by returning empty sublists in the result, and it correctly handles cases with multiple elements and spaces in the strings. The provided test cases validate that the function works as intended for various inputs, including those with leading/trailing spaces. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated code, the program is correct.
