Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. The code handles the following cases:

1. Sorting non-empty sublists correctly.
2. Handling empty sublists by producing empty sublists in the result.
3. Ensuring that the original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

The provided assertions cover various scenarios including sublists with different lengths, leading/trailing spaces in strings, and a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters. Since the code meets the requirements for all provided cases and potential edge cases mentioned in the hints, the program is correct.
