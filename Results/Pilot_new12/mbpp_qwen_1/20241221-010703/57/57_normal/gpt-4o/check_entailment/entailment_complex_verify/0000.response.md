Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. It states that the function accepts a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. The function does not modify the original list_of_lists but creates a new list with sorted sublists. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description, and there are no apparent issues or logical errors based on the annotations and the original assessment.
