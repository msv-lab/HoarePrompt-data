Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input as a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of sorted sublists. The test cases validate the function across various scenarios, including sublists with duplicate elements and sublists with leading/trailing spaces. Since the function behaves as expected and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that are not covered by the examples, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
