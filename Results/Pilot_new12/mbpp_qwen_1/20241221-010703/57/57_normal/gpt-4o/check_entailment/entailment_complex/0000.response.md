Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains strings) as input and returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. 

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to each sublist, resulting in a new list with sorted sublists.
- The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, as required.
- The function handles all cases as specified:
  - If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - If any inner list in `list_of_lists` is empty, the corresponding sublist in the returned list will also be empty.

Thus, the program correctly sorts each sublist of strings as per the problem description for all valid cases.
