Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, handling edge cases such as an empty list of lists or empty sublists. The function does not modify the original lists but creates a new list with sorted sublists, which aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the function based on the given test cases and the nature of the problem. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
