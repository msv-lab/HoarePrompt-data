The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list. (2) If any inner list in `list_of_lists` is empty, the corresponding sublist in the returned list will also be empty. The function does not modify the original lists but creates a new list with sorted sublists.
