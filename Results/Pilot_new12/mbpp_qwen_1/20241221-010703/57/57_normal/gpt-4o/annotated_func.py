#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of sorted sublists, where each sublist is sorted from the original list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list where each inner list is sorted in ascending order. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list. (2) If any inner list in `list_of_lists` is empty, the corresponding sublist in the returned list will also be empty. The function does not modify the original lists but creates a new list with sorted sublists.
