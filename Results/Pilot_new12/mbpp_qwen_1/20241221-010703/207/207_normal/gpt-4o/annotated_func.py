#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers. It returns their product. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single value, which is the multiplication result of `length` and `width`.
