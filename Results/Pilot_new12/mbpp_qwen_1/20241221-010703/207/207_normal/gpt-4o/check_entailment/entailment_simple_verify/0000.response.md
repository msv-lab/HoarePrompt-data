Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The assertions in the problem description correctly test the function with different inputs (10x20, 10x5, 4x2). The annotated version confirms that the function takes non-negative floating-point numbers or integers as inputs and returns their product, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no edge cases or constraints mentioned that would invalidate the function's correctness based on the provided information. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
