Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, and the provided assertions confirm its correctness for the given test cases. The output hints further validate that the function accepts non-negative floating-point numbers or integers for both parameters and returns their product. Since the program meets the problem description and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the original assessment is accurate.
