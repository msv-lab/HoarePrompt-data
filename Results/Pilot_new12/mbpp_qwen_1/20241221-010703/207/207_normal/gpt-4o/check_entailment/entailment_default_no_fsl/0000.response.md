Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The function handles the cases where both `length` and `width` are positive integers, as demonstrated by the assertions. Since the problem description only specifies that the function should find the area of a rectangle and the code correctly implements this functionality for the given test cases, and considering the constraints mentioned (valid inputs only), the code is correct for every potential case described.
