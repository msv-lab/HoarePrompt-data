Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The problem description states that the function should find the area of a rectangle, and the provided assertions test the function with different valid inputs (both integers). The function correctly returns the product of the length and width for these inputs, which aligns with the problem description. The function also handles non-negative floating-point numbers or integers as specified in the problem description, as evidenced by the assertions. Since the function behaves as expected for the given problem description and handles valid inputs without any issues, the program is correct.
