Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The assertions given in the problem description also correctly test the function with different inputs (10x20, 10x5, 4x2). Since the function works correctly for these examples and there is no information or requirement suggesting any additional edge cases or constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct.
