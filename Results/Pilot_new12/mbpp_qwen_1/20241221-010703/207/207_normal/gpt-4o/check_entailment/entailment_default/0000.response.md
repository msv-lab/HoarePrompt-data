Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of a rectangle. The function is simple and directly implements the formula for the area of a rectangle: \( \text{area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \).

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:
- `func_1(10, 20) == 200`
- `func_1(10, 5) == 50`
- `func_1(4, 2) == 8`

Since the problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, and the provided code correctly implements this, there are no missing functionalities or edge cases that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the scope of the given problem description.
