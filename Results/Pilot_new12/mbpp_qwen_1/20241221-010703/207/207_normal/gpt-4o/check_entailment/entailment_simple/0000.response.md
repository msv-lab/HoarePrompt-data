Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point numbers or integers. The function returns the product of these two parameters, which represents the area of a rectangle. The test cases provided (assert statements) confirm that the function correctly calculates the area for the given inputs:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`
- `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`
- `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`

Since the function logic aligns with the requirement to calculate the area of a rectangle and the test cases validate this functionality, the program is correct according to the problem description.
