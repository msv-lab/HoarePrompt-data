Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The provided assertions test the function with different valid inputs (10x20, 10x5, 4x2), and the output hints confirm that the function handles non-negative floating-point numbers or integers for both `length` and `width`. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
