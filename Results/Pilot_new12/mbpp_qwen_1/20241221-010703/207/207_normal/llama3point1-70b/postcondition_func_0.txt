The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are both non-negative floating-point or integer numbers, and returns their product. There are no additional actions performed beyond this calculation. The function does not handle any edge cases such as negative inputs or non-numeric types, nor does it perform any type checking or error handling. Therefore, if the inputs are not valid (e.g., negative numbers or non-numeric types), the function may still execute but will produce incorrect results or raise an error.
