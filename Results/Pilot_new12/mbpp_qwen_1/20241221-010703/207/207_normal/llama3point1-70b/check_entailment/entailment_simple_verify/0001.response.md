Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. Given that the inputs (length and width) are described as non-negative floating-point or integer numbers, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the function performs the necessary arithmetic operation without any issues, and there are no edge cases or invalid input scenarios mentioned in the problem description that would affect its correctness under the given assumptions.
