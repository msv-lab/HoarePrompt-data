Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle any edge cases such as negative inputs or non-numeric types. According to the problem description, the function should only return the product of the `length` and `width` if both are valid non-negative numbers. However, the function will still execute and return a result even if the inputs are negative or non-numeric, which would lead to incorrect results. For example, if `length` is -5 and `width` is 10, the function will return -50, which is not a valid area. Similarly, if either `length` or `width` is a string, the function will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
