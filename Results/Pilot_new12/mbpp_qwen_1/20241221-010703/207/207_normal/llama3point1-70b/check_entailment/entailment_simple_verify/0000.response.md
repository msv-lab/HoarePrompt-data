Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The annotated version confirms that the inputs are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers, which are valid dimensions for a rectangle. Since the problem description only requires the function to handle valid, non-negative inputs and the function `func_1` meets this requirement, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
