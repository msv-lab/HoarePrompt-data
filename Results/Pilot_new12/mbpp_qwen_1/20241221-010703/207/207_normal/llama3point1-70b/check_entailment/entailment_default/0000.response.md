Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the area calculation for a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. Given the problem description, the function simply needs to return the product of the length and width. The output hints confirm that the function performs this operation without any additional actions. Since the function handles the basic requirement of finding the area and does not include any checks for invalid inputs (as specified in the hints), we assume the inputs will be valid (non-negative numbers). Therefore, the function meets the problem description for every potential case.
