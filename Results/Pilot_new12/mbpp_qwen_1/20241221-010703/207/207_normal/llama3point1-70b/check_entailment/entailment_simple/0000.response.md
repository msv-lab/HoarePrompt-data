Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the area of a rectangle. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are both non-negative floating-point or integer numbers as per the problem description. The function returns the product of these two parameters, which is the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width). Since the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs (non-negative numbers), it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
