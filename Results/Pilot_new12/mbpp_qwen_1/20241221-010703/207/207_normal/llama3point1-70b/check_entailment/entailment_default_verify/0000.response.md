Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle given valid positive numeric inputs, the original assessment overlooks the fact that the function does not handle edge cases such as negative numbers, non-numeric types, or zero values. According to the output hints, these scenarios can lead to incorrect results or even raise errors. Since the problem description did not explicitly state that the function should handle such edge cases, the original assessment was too broad. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the provided information and output hints.
