Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated by multiplying the `length` and `width`. The function `func_1` accomplishes this by simply returning the product of `length` and `width`.

Given the assumptions that the inputs will be valid (non-negative floating-point or integer numbers) and there are no edge cases or error handling for invalid inputs, the function correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
