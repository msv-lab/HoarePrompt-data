Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. Given the problem description to find the area of a rectangle, this function meets the requirement for all potential cases where both length and width are positive numbers. Since there are no edge cases or specific conditions mentioned in the problem description that this function fails to handle, we can conclude that the program is correct.
