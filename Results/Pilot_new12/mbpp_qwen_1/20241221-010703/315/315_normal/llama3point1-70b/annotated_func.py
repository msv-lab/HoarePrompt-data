#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list, and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a list converted from `input_tuple`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. It converts `input_tuple` into a list, then concatenates this list with `input_list`. Finally, it returns the resulting concatenated list. This function handles the conversion of a tuple to a list and ensures that both inputs are properly combined into a single list. Potential edge cases include empty lists or tuples; however, the function correctly handles these by simply appending an empty list in such scenarios. There is no missing functionality as described in the annotations.
