Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly concatenates a list (`input_list`) with a tuple (`input_tuple`) converted to a list. The annotation confirms that the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a list converted from `input_tuple`. Since the problem description asks for a function that adds a given tuple to a given list, and the function `func_1` performs this operation correctly without any issues or edge cases that would invalidate its correctness, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is justified.
