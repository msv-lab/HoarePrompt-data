Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple (to a list). The use of the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists is valid and works correctly under the assumption that the inputs are valid (i.e., `input_list` is a list and `input_tuple` is a tuple). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
