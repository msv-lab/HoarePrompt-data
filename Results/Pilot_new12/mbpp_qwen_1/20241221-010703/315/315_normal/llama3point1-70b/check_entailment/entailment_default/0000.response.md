Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple` as inputs. It converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and then concatenates it with `input_list` using the `+` operator. This operation creates a new list that includes all elements from `input_list` followed by all elements from `input_tuple`.

Given the problem description, the function needs to add the given tuple to the given list. The provided function accomplishes this by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected and handles all potential edge cases, such as empty lists or tuples, correctly.

Since the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem and the output hints, the correctness of the function is **True**.
