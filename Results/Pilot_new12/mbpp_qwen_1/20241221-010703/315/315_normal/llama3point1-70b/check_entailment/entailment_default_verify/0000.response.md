Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` concatenates a given list with a tuple converted to a list, returning a new list that is the result of this concatenation. The provided output hints also confirm that the function correctly handles the conversion of a tuple to a list and combines it with the input list. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the output hints that indicate the function does not meet the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
