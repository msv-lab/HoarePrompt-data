Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function converts the tuple into a list using the `list()` constructor and then concatenates this list with the original input list. The result is returned as a new list.

The function meets the requirement of adding the given tuple to the given list because:
- It accepts the required types of parameters (a list and a tuple).
- It converts the tuple to a list.
- It concatenates the converted list with the input list.
- It returns the concatenated list.

Since the function handles the conversion and concatenation as specified and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would make the function incorrect, the program is correct.
