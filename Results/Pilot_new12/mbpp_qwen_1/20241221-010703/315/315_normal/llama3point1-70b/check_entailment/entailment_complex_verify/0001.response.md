Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as inputs, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the original list. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the conversion and concatenation correctly. Since the problem description asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list, and the function `func_1` performs this operation correctly under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
