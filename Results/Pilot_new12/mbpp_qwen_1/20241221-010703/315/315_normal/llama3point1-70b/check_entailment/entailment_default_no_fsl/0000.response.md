Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists or tuples by simply appending an empty list, which does not alter the original list. Since the problem description only requires adding the tuple to the list and the function fulfills this requirement without any issues, the code is correct for every potential case.
