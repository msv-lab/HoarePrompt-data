Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple (to a list). This operation is well-defined and works correctly for all potential cases. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists, which is valid and returns a new list containing all elements from both the original list and the converted tuple. Therefore, this implementation meets the requirements of the problem description for any input list and tuple.
