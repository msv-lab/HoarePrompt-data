Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function returns the result of concatenating `input_list` with a list converted from `input_tuple`. This directly meets the requirement specified in the problem description, which states: "Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list."

Since the function correctly performs the concatenation of a list and a tuple (converted to a list), it adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
