#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of lst and the list converted from tpl
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list and then concatenates it with `lst`. The function returns a new list that is the result of this concatenation. This process handles both non-empty and empty lists/tuples, as well as tuples containing no elements. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function correctly processes the inputs as described.
