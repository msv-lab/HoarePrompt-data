Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list and then concatenates it with `lst`. The function returns a new list that is the result of this concatenation. This process handles both non-empty and empty lists/tuples, as well as tuples containing no elements. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function correctly processes the inputs as described.**
