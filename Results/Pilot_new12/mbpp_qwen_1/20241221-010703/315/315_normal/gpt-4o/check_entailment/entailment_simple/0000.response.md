Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list as per the problem description. The function takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`). It then concatenates the list with a new list created from the tuple using the `list()` constructor and returns the result. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function consistently adds the tuple to the list as required by the problem description, the program is correct.
