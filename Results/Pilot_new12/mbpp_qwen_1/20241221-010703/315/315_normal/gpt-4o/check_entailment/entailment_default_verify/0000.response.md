Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The function `func_1` correctly concatenates a tuple with a list, producing a new list that includes all elements from both the original list and the tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles both non-empty and empty lists/tuples, as well as tuples containing no elements. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is maintained.
