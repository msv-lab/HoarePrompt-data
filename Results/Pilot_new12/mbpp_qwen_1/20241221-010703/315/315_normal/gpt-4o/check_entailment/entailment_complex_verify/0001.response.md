Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly concatenates a list and a tuple. The annotations clearly describe that the function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates it with the original list. The provided assertions all pass and demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given inputs. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function behaves as expected and concatenates the list and tuple without any issues. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
