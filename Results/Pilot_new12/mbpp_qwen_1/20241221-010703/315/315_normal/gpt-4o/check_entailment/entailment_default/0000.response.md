Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly adds a tuple to a list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. The function `func_1` meets the problem description for every potential case, as demonstrated by the assertions. The function works for both non-empty and empty lists and tuples, and it correctly handles the concatenation without any issues. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that would cause the function to fail, making the program correct.
