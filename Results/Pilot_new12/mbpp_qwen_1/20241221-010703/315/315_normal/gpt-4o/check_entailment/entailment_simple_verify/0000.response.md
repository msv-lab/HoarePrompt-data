Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple. The provided assertions in the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. The function does not encounter any issues with invalid inputs under the assumption that valid inputs are provided. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
