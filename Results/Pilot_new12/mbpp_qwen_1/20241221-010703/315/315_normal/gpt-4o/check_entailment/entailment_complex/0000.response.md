Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly adds a given tuple to a given list. The function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as arguments, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates it with the original list. The resulting list is returned. 

The problem description states that the function should add the given tuple to the given list. The provided code satisfies this requirement by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the list. The test cases provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function performs the required operation and the test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
