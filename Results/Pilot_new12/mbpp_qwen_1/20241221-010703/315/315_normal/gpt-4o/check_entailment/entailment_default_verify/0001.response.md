Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to take a list and a tuple as inputs and return a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple. The provided output hints confirm that the function correctly converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the given list. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and that the operation of concatenating a list and a tuple is well-defined. Since the function handles both non-empty and empty lists/tuples and there are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
