Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple. The assertions provided in the test cases all pass, and based on the function implementation, it correctly concatenates the list and the tuple for the given examples. Since the function behaves as expected for the given cases and the operation of concatenating a list and a tuple is well-defined, we can conclude that the function is correct for the described problem. There do not appear to be any edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation that would cause it to fail for other inputs.
