Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and concatenates it with the original list. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given cases. Since the code handles concatenation of lists and tuples without any issues, and there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that require additional handling, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
