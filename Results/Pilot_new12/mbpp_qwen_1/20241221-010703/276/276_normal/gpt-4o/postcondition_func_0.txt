The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of length `n`. It merges these two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then calculates and returns the median of `merged_list`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`). If the length is odd, the median is the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`). This calculation is done after merging the lists, regardless of whether the individual lists were originally even or odd in length.
