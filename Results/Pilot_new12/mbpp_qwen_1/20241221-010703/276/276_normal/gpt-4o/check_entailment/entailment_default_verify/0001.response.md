Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly merges two sorted lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median according to the length of the merged list. The output hints also confirm this behavior. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the function, and there are no apparent edge cases or potential errors that would cause the function to fail for other inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness as True is justified.
