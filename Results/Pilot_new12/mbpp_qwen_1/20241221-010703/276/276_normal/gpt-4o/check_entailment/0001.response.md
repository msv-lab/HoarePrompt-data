Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Given the examples provided:

1. For lists `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, the merged and sorted list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The median is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`.
2. For lists `[2, 4, 8, 9]` and `[7, 13, 19, 28]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28]`. The median is `(8 + 9) / 2 = 8.5`.
3. For lists `[3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42]` and `[2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 3, 6, 14, 18, 23, 27, 36, 39, 42, 49, 55]`. The median is `(23 + 27) / 2 = 25.0`.

In each case, the function handles the merging and sorting correctly and computes the median accurately. There are no apparent edge cases or potential errors in the given implementation that would cause the function to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
