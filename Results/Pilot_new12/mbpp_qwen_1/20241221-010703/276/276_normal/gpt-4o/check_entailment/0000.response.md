Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The approach of merging the two lists and then finding the median based on the length of the merged list is appropriate. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly. Given the provided test cases and the nature of the problem, the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases.
