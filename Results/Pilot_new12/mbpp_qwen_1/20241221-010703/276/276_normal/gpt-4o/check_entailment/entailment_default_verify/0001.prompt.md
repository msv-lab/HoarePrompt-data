You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Given the examples provided:

1. For lists `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38]` and `[2, 13, 17, 30, 45]`, the merged and sorted list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The median is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`.
2. For lists `[2, 4, 8, 9]` and `[7, 13, 19, 28]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 28]`. The median is `(8 + 9) / 2 = 8.5`.
3. For lists `[3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42]` and `[2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55]`, the merged and sorted list is `[2, 3, 6, 14, 18, 23, 27, 36, 39, 42, 49, 55]`. The median is `(23 + 27) / 2 = 25.0`.

In each case, the function handles the merging and sorting correctly and computes the median accurately. There are no apparent edge cases or potential errors in the given implementation that would cause the function to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of length `n`. It merges these two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then calculates and returns the median of `merged_list`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`). If the length is odd, the median is the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`). This calculation is done after merging the lists, regardless of whether the individual lists were originally even or odd in length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
