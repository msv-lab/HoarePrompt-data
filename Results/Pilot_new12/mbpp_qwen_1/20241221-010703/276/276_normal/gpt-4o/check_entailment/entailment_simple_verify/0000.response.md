Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points. The function `func_1` correctly merges two sorted lists and calculates the median based on the length of the merged list. The annotations confirm that the function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly, returning the appropriate median value. Given the provided test cases and the annotations, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is justified.
