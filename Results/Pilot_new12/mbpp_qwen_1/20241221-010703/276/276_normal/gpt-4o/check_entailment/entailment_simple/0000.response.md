Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer `n` (the length of the lists). The problem description does not specify handling invalid inputs, so assuming valid inputs as stated, this part is correct.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The program merges the two lists into one (`merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)`), and then sorts the resulting list. Since both input lists are already sorted, this step ensures the final merged list is sorted.

3. **Finding the Median**: 
   - The midpoint (`mid`) of the merged list is calculated.
   - Depending on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd, the median is computed:
     - If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).
     - If the length is odd, the median is the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`).

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed median, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
