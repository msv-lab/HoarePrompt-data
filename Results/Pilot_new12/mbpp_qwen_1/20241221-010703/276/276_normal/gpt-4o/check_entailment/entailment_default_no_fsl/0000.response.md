Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function `func_1` merges the two lists into a single sorted list, then calculates the median based on the length of the merged list. The code handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly by averaging the two middle elements or returning the middle element, respectively. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and all pass, indicating that the code works as expected for the given problem description.
