Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided code merges the two lists and then calculates the median based on the length of the merged list, which is a valid approach. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly by averaging the two middle elements if the length is even, and by returning the middle element if the length is odd. The provided test cases support the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
