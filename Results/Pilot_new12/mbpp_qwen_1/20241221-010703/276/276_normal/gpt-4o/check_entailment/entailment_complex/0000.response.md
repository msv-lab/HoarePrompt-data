Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the median of two sorted lists of the same length.
2. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. However, `n` is redundant since the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are checked within the function.
   - The two lists are concatenated and sorted to form a single list called `merged_list`.
   - The midpoint `mid` of the merged list is calculated using integer division.
   - Depending on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd, the median is computed either as the average of the two middle elements or as the middle element itself.
3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided test various cases and confirm that the function returns the expected median values, indicating that the implementation handles both even and odd-length merged lists correctly.

Since the function correctly merges the two sorted lists and computes the median according to the given rules, the program follows the problem description accurately for all valid inputs, thus making it correct.
