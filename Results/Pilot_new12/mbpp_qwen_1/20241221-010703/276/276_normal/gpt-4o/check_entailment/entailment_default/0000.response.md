Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists of the same size and merges them into a single sorted list. It then calculates the median of this merged list correctly. If the length of the merged list is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, it returns the middle element. This logic aligns with the standard method for finding the median of a combined sorted list.

The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the function:
- For the first test case, the merged list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`.
- For the second test case, the merged list is `[2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 18, 19, 23, 27, 28, 30, 39, 42, 49, 55]`, and the median is `(9 + 13) / 2 = 8.5`.
- For the third test case, the merged list is `[2, 3, 6, 14, 18, 27, 36, 39, 42, 49, 55]`, and the median is `27`.

Since the code handles the merging and median calculation correctly for the provided examples and no other issues arise from the problem description, the function is correct.
