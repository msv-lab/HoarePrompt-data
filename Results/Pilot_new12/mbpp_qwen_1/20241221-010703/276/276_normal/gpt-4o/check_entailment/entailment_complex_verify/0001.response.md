Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version reinforces the correctness of the function `func_1`:

1. The function merges two sorted lists and sorts them to form a new list `merged_list`.
2. It correctly calculates the median based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd.
3. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including cases where the length of the combined list is even or odd.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and the provided examples validate the function's behavior, there is no indication of any issues with the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
