Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The original assessment is accurate because:

1. The function merges the two sorted lists into one sorted list, which is a correct approach for finding the median of the combined lists.
2. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly by calculating the median as the average of the two middle elements for even lengths and as the middle element for odd lengths.
3. The provided test cases in the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs.

The annotated version further supports the correctness by clearly describing the state of the program at different points and confirming the logic of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
