The code `mid = len(merged_list) // 2` calculates the midpoint index of the `merged_list` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. The length of `merged_list` is `2n`, where `n` is the length of `list1` (or `list2`). The value of `mid` is the integer division of `2n` by 2, which is `n`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` containing elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order; `mid` is `n`.**
