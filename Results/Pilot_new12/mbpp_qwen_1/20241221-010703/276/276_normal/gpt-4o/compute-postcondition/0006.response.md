Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` containing elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order; `mid` is `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`. Otherwise, the median is the element at index `n` in `merged_list`.***
