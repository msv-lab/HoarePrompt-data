Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of length `n`. It merges these two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then calculates and returns the median of `merged_list`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`). If the length is odd, the median is the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`). This calculation is done after merging the lists, regardless of whether the individual lists were originally even or odd in length.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `list1` and `list2` are already sorted and have the same length `n`. If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior would be undefined, but since the annotations indicate that these lists are sorted and of the same length, we do not need to explicitly mention this in the functionality. However, if the lists were not guaranteed to be sorted or of the same length, the function would need additional checks or preprocessing steps to handle such cases.
