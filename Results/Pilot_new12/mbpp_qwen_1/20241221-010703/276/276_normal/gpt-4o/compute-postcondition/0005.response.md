The code assigns the value at index `mid` of `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` (where `n` is the length of `list1` and `list2`), and `mid` is equal to `n`, the value of `median` will be the element at index `n` in `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` containing elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order; `mid` is `n`; `median` is the element at index `n` in `merged_list`.**
