The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`. The function returns the median of the merged list, which is the average of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` if the length of `merged_list` is even, or the element at index `n` in `merged_list` if the length is odd.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of integers `list1` and `list2` of equal length `n`, merge them, and return the median of the merged list.
