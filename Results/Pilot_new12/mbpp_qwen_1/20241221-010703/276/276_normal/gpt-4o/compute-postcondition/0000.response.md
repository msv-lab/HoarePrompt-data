`merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, their concatenation followed by sorting will result in a single sorted list of length `2n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` containing elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order.**
