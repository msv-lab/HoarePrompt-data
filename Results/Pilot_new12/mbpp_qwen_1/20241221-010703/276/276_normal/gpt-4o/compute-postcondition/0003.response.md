The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since `merged_list` has a length of `2n` (even), the middle elements are located at indices `mid - 1` and `mid`.

- The variable `median` is assigned the value of `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`.
- The other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `merged_list`, and `mid`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `median` and retains the original values of `list1`, `list2`, `merged_list`, and `mid`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list of length `2n` containing elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order; `mid` is `n`; `median` is the average of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`.**
