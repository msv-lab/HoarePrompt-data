#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If the size of `merged_list` is even, the median is \(\frac{\text{merged\_list}[size - 1] + \text{merged\_list}[size]}{2}\). Otherwise, the median is `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either (merged_list[middle_index] if the size of merged_list is odd) or ((merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2 if the size of merged_list is even)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with their common size `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. The median is calculated as follows: if the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element; if it is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The function ensures that the input lists are sorted and that `size` is a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the median value, which is either a single element or the average of two elements depending on whether the size of the merged list is odd or even.
