Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists. The issue arises because the function `func_1` merges the two lists and then finds the median based on the size of the merged list, rather than directly using the elements from both lists. This approach is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the combined list has more than just two middle elements. For example, consider two sorted lists `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2, 4, 6]` both of size 3. The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and the median calculation would incorrectly return `3.5` instead of the correct median, which should be `3.5` but derived from the direct middle elements of the two lists without merging them first. The correct approach would involve finding the k-th smallest element in the combined list without fully merging them, typically using a binary search method.
