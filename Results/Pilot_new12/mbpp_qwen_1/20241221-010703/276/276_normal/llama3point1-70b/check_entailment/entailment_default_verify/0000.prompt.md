You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` has a critical issue when handling the case where both lists are empty. In such a scenario, the function would call `sorted([] + [])`, which results in an empty list, and then tries to access elements beyond its bounds, leading to an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function assumes that the combined list will always have a middle element, but this might not be the case if the total number of elements is zero. Hereâ€™s a specific example that demonstrates the issue:

```python
list1 = []
list2 = []
size = 0
print(func_1(list1, list2, size))  # This will raise an IndexError
```

Since the function does not handle the case where the combined list is empty, it fails to provide a correct output for this potential case, making the program incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with their common size `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. The median is calculated as follows: if the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element; if it is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The function ensures that the input lists are sorted and that `size` is a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the median value, which is either a single element or the average of two elements depending on whether the size of the merged list is odd or even.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
