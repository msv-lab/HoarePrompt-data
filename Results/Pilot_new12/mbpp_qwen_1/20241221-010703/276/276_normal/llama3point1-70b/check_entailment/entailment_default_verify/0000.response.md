Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the combined list is empty. Specifically, when both `list1` and `list2` are empty, the function attempts to access indices that do not exist in an empty list, leading to an `IndexError`. The output hints mention that the function should handle the case where the input lists are sorted and `size` is a positive integer, but they do not indicate that the function should handle the edge case of an empty list. Therefore, the program is still incorrect according to the problem description and the original assessment.
