You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where both lists are empty. According to the problem description, the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the provided implementation will raise an `IndexError` when both `list1` and `list2` are empty because `size` would be 0, and the code attempts to access `merged_list[size - 1]`, which results in accessing `merged_list[-1]` for an empty list. This index is out of bounds.

To fix this, the function should check if both lists are empty before proceeding with the sorting. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if size == 0:
        return None  # Or raise an appropriate exception or handle the case as needed
    
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2  # Use integer division to get the correct middle index
    
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    
    return median
```

This modification ensures that the function handles the case where both lists are empty and avoids the `IndexError`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If the size of `merged_list` is even, the median is \(\frac{\text{merged\_list}[size - 1] + \text{merged\_list}[size]}{2}\). Otherwise, the median is `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either (merged_list[middle_index] if the size of merged_list is odd) or ((merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2 if the size of merged_list is even)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with their common size `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. The median is calculated as follows: if the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element; if it is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The function ensures that the input lists are sorted and that `size` is a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the median value, which is either a single element or the average of two elements depending on whether the size of the merged list is odd or even.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
