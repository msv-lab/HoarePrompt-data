Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where both lists are empty. According to the problem description, the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the provided implementation will raise an `IndexError` when both `list1` and `list2` are empty because `size` would be 0, and the code attempts to access `merged_list[size - 1]`, which results in accessing `merged_list[-1]` for an empty list. This index is out of bounds.

To fix this, the function should check if both lists are empty before proceeding with the sorting. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if size == 0:
        return None  # Or raise an appropriate exception or handle the case as needed
    
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2  # Use integer division to get the correct middle index
    
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    
    return median
```

This modification ensures that the function handles the case where both lists are empty and avoids the `IndexError`.
