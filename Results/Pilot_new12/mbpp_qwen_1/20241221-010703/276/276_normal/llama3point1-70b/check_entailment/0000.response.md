Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` has a critical issue when handling the case where both lists are empty. In such a scenario, the function would call `sorted([] + [])`, which results in an empty list, and then tries to access elements beyond its bounds, leading to an `IndexError`. Additionally, the function assumes that the combined list will always have a middle element, but this might not be the case if the total number of elements is zero. Hereâ€™s a specific example that demonstrates the issue:

```python
list1 = []
list2 = []
size = 0
print(func_1(list1, list2, size))  # This will raise an IndexError
```

Since the function does not handle the case where the combined list is empty, it fails to provide a correct output for this potential case, making the program incorrect.
