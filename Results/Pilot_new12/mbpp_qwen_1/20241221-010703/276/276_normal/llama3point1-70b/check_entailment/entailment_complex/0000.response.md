Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists. According to the problem description, the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the current implementation merges the two lists into one sorted list and then calculates the median based on the position of the middle elements in this merged list. 

For two sorted lists of the same size `n`, the correct approach to find the median would involve combining elements from both lists to maintain the sorted order without fully merging them. Specifically, the median of two sorted lists of equal length can be found by selecting the `n/2`th element in each list and comparing them. The median is then determined by these two elements if `n` is even, or the middle element if `n` is odd.

The current implementation does not follow this approach. Instead, it merges the two lists into a single sorted list, which changes the nature of the problem. This method would be correct if the problem was to find the median of a single sorted list, but not for finding the median of two separate sorted lists.

To meet the problem description, the program should:

1. Iterate through both lists simultaneously.
2. Compare elements from both lists.
3. Determine the median based on the values at the `n/2`th positions.

Therefore, the program as written does not correctly solve the problem as described.
