Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has an issue with determining the correct middle index for calculating the median. Specifically, the middle index is set to `size - 1`, which is incorrect. For a list of size `n`, the middle index should be `n // 2` for both even and odd sizes. This mistake leads to the code incorrectly accessing the elements of the merged list. 

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, both of size 2. The merged and sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the code would incorrectly calculate the median as `2`.

To fix this, the code should change the line:
```python
middle_index = size - 1
```
to:
```python
middle_index = size // 2 - 1
```
This adjustment ensures that the middle index is correctly calculated for both even and odd-sized lists.
