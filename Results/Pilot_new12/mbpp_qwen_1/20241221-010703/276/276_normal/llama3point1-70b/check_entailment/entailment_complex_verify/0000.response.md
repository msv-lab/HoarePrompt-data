Final: **False**

Reason: Although the annotated version provides additional context about the state of the program, it does not address the fundamental issue identified in the original assessment. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where both input lists are empty. When `list1` and `list2` are both empty and `size` is 0, the function attempts to create an empty `merged_list` and then access indices `size - 1` and `size` (which are both out of bounds for an empty list), leading to an `IndexError`. Since the annotated version does not provide any mechanism to handle this edge case, the function remains incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
