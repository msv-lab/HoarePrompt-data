The code `middle_index = size - 1` assigns the value of `size - 1` to the variable `middle_index`. Here, `size` is not defined in the provided context, but we can infer that it refers to the length of one of the lists (`list1` or `list2`) since the merged list is a combination of these two. However, the exact value of `size` is not given, so we will keep it as `size`.

Since `size` is the length of one of the lists (either `list1` or `list2`), and the merged list is already sorted, the value of `middle_index` is simply the length of one of the original lists minus one. The merged list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`**
