Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with their common size `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. The median is calculated as follows: if the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element; if it is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The function ensures that the input lists are sorted and that `size` is a positive integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the median value, which is either a single element or the average of two elements depending on whether the size of the merged list is odd or even.**

Edge Cases:
- If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function will still execute correctly assuming the other list is not empty and `size` is valid. However, the function assumes both lists have the same size, so an empty list scenario would be invalid.
- If `size` is 1, the function will merge two lists each with one element, resulting in a merged list of two elements, and the median will be the average of these two elements.
- If `size` is 2, the function will merge two lists each with two elements, resulting in a merged list of four elements, and the median will be the average of the second and third elements.

Missing Functionality:
- The code assumes that both `list1` and `list2` are already sorted and have the same size. There is no validation or sorting check for these conditions, although the postconditions imply that the lists should be sorted and of equal size.
