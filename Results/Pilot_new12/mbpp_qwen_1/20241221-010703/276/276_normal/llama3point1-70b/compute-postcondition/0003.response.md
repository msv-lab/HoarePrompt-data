The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since the size of `merged_list` is even, the middle index is `size - 1`. The value of `middle_index + 1` would be the next element, which is the middle element when considering the pair of middle elements.

Given that `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers and its size is even, let's denote the size of `merged_list` as `size`. The `middle_index` is `size - 1`, so the two middle elements are `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`.

The median is calculated as:
\[ \text{median} = \frac{\text{merged\_list}[size - 1] + \text{merged\_list}[size]}{2} \]

Since the exact values of the elements in `merged_list` are not provided, we express the median in terms of these elements. The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `merged_list`, and `middle_index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, the size of `merged_list` is even, `median` is \(\frac{\text{merged\_list}[size - 1] + \text{merged\_list}[size]}{2}\)**
