The code concatenates `list1` and `list2` into a new list, and then sorts this new list. Since both `list1` and `list2` are already sorted, their concatenation followed by sorting results in a single sorted list that contains all elements from both `list1` and `list2`. The original lists `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and the size of `merged_list` is twice the size of `list1` (or `list2`). The variables `list1` and `list2` retain their original values.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
