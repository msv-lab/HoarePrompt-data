The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size, and `size` is a positive integer. The function returns the median of the merged list, which is either the middle element if the size of the merged list is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if the size of the merged list is even.
