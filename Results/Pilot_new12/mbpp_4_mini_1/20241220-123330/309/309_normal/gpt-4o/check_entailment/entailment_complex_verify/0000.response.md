Based on the provided problem description, the function `func_1` is expected to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. The original assessment labeled the correctness of the function as **False** due to its handling of empty strings, stating that returning `True` for an empty string is ambiguous and that it would be more reasonable to return `False`.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it confirms that when the input is an empty string, `func_1` will indeed return `True`. However, the problem description does not specify any criteria for how to handle empty strings. Therefore, it remains ambiguous whether all characters being the same applies to an empty string or if it should default to `False`.

The assertions provided in the original code for non-empty strings (`'python'`, `'aaa'`, and `'data'`) correctly demonstrate the function's intended behavior in those cases, returning `False`, `True`, and `False`, respectively. The handling of non-empty strings is correct; it's specifically the case of the empty string that causes concern.

However, since we've established that the function is only required to check the uniformity of characters when they exist, and not necessarily define behavior for an empty string, I align more closely with the original assessment. The original judgment about the function being incorrect holds when considering that the expected behavior regarding empty strings is indeed justified as returning `False` might be a reasonable expectation for many use cases.

Given the assumptions stipulated that the user will always provide valid input, the known defect pertaining to the empty string complicates matters but doesn't ultimately change the correctness of the function for defined string inputs.

Final: **False**
