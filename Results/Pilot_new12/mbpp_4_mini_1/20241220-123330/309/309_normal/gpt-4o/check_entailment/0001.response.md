Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle the case of an empty string. According to the problem description, if the string is empty, the function should return False (because there are no characters to compare). However, the implementation returns True for an empty string:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not s:  # This handles the empty string case
        return True  # Incorrect behavior: should return False
```

This leads to the following example where the function does not work as expected:

```python
assert func_1('') == False  # This will return True, but should return False
```

Since the function has an incorrect return value for the case of an empty string, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
