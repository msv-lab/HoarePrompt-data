Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the handling of the empty string input. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in the string are the same. The program, however, returns `True` for an empty string, which is counterintuitive because the problem does not specify how to treat an empty string, and generally, one might expect that an empty string does not contain the same characters.

The program's logic is otherwise correct for non-empty strings since it checks each character against the first character. However, the handling of the empty string input (returning `True`) makes it incorrect per the problem's implicit assumptions. 

In summary, there is ambiguity regarding how to handle empty input, and returning `True` for an empty string does not align with a common interpretation of checking if all characters are the same, especially when considering no characters at all. To make the program correct, it should explicitly handle the empty string case, likely by returning `False`.
