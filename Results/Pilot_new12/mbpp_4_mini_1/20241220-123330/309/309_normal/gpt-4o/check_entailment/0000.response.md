Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to check whether all characters in the given string `s` are the same. However, there is an issue with the handling of an empty string. According to the problem description, the expectations on how to treat empty strings are not explicitly laid out.

Here, when the input is an empty string `''`, `func_1` returns `True`. Yet, whether all characters are the same in an empty string is ambiguous, as there are no characters to compare. A more reasonable expectation might be to return `False` for an empty string, as there are no characters to satisfy the condition of being "the same."

Thus, an edge case to consider:
- Input: `""` (an empty string) should ideally return `False` as there are no characters present.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs, making it incorrect.
