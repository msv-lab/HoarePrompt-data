Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of non-string inputs. If a non-string input like a number or list were to be passed to the function `func_1`, it would raise an error, such as `TypeError`. While the current assertions all use valid string inputs, the problem description does not specify that the function should handle only strings. The lack of handling for various potential input types constitutes a failure to meet the problem requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
