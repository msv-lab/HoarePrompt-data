#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of characters, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all characters in the string 's' are equal to the first character 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` as input. It checks if the string is empty; if so, it returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, it compares every character in the string to the first character. If all characters are the same as the first character, it returns `True`. If any character differs, it returns `False`. The function does not handle non-string inputs, which could lead to an error if such an input is provided.
