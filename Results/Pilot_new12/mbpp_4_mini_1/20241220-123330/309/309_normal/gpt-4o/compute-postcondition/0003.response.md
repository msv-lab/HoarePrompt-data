`first_char` is assigned the value of the first character in the string `s`. The value of `s` is not empty, so `first_char` will hold the first character of the non-empty string. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters, and `s` is not an empty string; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
