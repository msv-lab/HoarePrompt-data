Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` as input. It checks if the string is empty; if so, it returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, it compares every character in the string to the first character. If all characters are the same as the first character, it returns `True`. If any character differs, it returns `False`. The function does not handle non-string inputs, which could lead to an error if such an input is provided.**
