According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. The loop requires that `s` is not empty, which we are assured. Since `s` is not an empty string, the loop will execute at least once with `char` being the first character of `s`. 

At the start of the loop, `first_char` is already set to the first character of `s`. Therefore, the state can remain as is, ensuring that the loop is ready to execute properly from the start.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`**
