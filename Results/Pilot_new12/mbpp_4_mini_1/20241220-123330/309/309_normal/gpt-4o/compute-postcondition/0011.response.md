According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Since the last iteration of the loop processed a character represented by `char`, the next character will be processed in the next iteration. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `char` is currently a character from the string `s`, and `first_char` is defined, used to check against `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the next value of `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.

If there are more characters in `s`, `char` will take on the next character from `s` in the upcoming iteration. For the loop to run one more time, it is necessary that `s` has at least one more character remaining after the current character.

Assuming the loop has not finished iterating through all characters and that `s` has a total of `n` characters, if `char` is currently processing character `k` (with some index), the next character will be at index `k + 1`. 

Thus, assuming that `s` has more than `k` characters, we can conclude the next state necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters, `char` is the next character in `s`, and the loop must have at least one more character to iterate over.**
