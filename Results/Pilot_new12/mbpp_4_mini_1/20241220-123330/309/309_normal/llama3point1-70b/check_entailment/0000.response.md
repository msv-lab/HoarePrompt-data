Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters, and then checks if the length of that set is equal to 1. 

- If `s` is empty, `set(s)` will be an empty set (`set()`), and since `len(set())` is 0, the condition `len(set(s)) == 1` will be False. This behavior is appropriate as there are no characters to compare, implying not all characters are the same.
- If `s` contains one character (e.g., "a"), `set(s)` will contain only that character, making the length 1, thus returning True.
- For strings with multiple characters either all the same (e.g., "aaaa") or not all the same (e.g., "aaab"), this function will correctly identify these cases.

Therefore, in every scenario tested, the function meets the problem description's requirements.
