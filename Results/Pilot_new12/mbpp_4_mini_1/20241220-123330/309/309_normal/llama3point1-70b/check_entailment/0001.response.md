Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set (which removes duplicate characters) and then checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. 

This logic will yield `True` if all characters in the string are identical and `False` otherwise. 

Let's examine potential edge cases:
1. For an empty string `""`, the set will be empty, and `len(set(""))` will equal 0. The function will return `False`, which is consistent with the expectation that there are no characters to compare.
2. For a single character string `"a"`, the set will contain one element: `{'a'}`. The function will return `True`, which is correct.
3. For strings with multiple characters that are the same like `"aaaa"`, the function will return `True`, which is also correct.
4. For a string with different characters, like `"abc"`, the function will return `False`, which is again correct.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, demonstrating that it correctly identifies whether all characters in the input string are the same. Therefore, I found no instances where the function does not follow the problem description, confirming its correctness.
