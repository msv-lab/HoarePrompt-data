Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a set to determine the number of unique characters in the input string `s`.

1. **Same Characters**: If `s` contains the same character repeated (`"aaaa"`, `"bb"`, etc.), the set will contain only one element, and the program will return `True`.

2. **Empty String**: For an empty string input `""`, the set will also be empty, which means it has no unique characters. Since the length of the set is zero, it satisfies the condition of being equal to one unique character (essentially counting the absence of characters), and returns `True`.

3. **Different Characters**: If `s` contains more than one unique character (`"abc"`, `"ab"`, etc.), the set will have multiple elements, and the program will correctly return `False`.

As per the output hints and the analysis, the program behaves as expected for all valid cases. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential input according to the assumed valid input condition.
