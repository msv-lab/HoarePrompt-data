Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies the correctness of the program `func_1(s)` based on the problem description of checking whether all characters in the string are the same. The provided annotations align with both the original assessment and the problem description, confirming the function's behavior.

The function checks the uniqueness of characters in the string by converting it to a set and comparing the length of that set. It correctly returns `True` for empty strings and strings with identical characters, while returning `False` for strings containing different characters. Furthermore, the annotation reiterates that an empty string is treated as having no unique characters, which is consistent with the evaluation provided.

There are no unhandled cases based on the assumption that valid input is provided. Therefore, the assessment that the function is correct remains valid.
