Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which will contain only unique characters from the string. If the length of this set is equal to 1, it means all characters in the original string were the same since there is only one unique character present. If the length is greater than 1, it indicates that there are multiple unique characters in the string.

Thus, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to check whether all characters are the same. It handles all valid input cases as specified, assuming valid input is always given, as per the problem constraints.
