#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, and all elements at odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at these odd indices is even, the function would have returned False; otherwise, it continues past the loop without returning.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements at the odd indices of the list `lst` are odd integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks the parity of elements located at odd indices. Specifically, it iterates over the odd indices of the list, and if it encounters any even integer at these indices, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it concludes by returning `True`. It is important to note that there is an implicit assumption that the input list `lst` has a length greater than one; if the list has fewer than two elements, the function behaves with no explicit handling for this edge case, which could lead to an IndexError during iteration if `len(lst)` is 1. Consequently, the overall behavior is to verify whether all elements at odd indices are odd integers while lacking explicit safeguards for lists of insufficient length.
