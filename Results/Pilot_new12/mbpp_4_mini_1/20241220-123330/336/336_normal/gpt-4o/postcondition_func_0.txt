The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks the parity of elements located at odd indices. Specifically, it iterates over the odd indices of the list, and if it encounters any even integer at these indices, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it concludes by returning `True`. It is important to note that there is an implicit assumption that the input list `lst` has a length greater than one; if the list has fewer than two elements, the function behaves with no explicit handling for this edge case, which could lead to an IndexError during iteration if `len(lst)` is 1. Consequently, the overall behavior is to verify whether all elements at odd indices are odd integers while lacking explicit safeguards for lists of insufficient length.
