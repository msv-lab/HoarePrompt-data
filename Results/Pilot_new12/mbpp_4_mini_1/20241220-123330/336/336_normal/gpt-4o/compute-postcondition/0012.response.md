The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function checks the elements at the odd indices of the list and has several return cases. If none of the conditions for returning `False` are met, it finally returns `True`, indicating that all elements at the odd indices of the list `lst` are odd integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and determine if all elements at the odd indices are odd integers, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if all elements at the odd indices of lst are odd integers; otherwise, it returns False.**
