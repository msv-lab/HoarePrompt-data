You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to check if every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. However, the implementation is incorrect in its logic because it returns `True` even when the last element is at an odd index. 

For example, consider the case `func_1([2, 1, 4])`. In this case:
- Index 1 (the odd index) contains `1`, which is odd, so according to the function, it would return `True`.

However, if we consider the input `[2, 4, 6]`, where there is no odd index in length, the program would simply not check anything and thus would return `True` as well, despite the presence of an even number at the odd index position.

Therefore, the program does not correctly follow the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, and all elements at odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at these odd indices is even, the function would have returned False; otherwise, it continues past the loop without returning.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements at the odd indices of the list `lst` are odd integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks the parity of elements located at odd indices. Specifically, it iterates over the odd indices of the list, and if it encounters any even integer at these indices, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it concludes by returning `True`. It is important to note that there is an implicit assumption that the input list `lst` has a length greater than one; if the list has fewer than two elements, the function behaves with no explicit handling for this edge case, which could lead to an IndexError during iteration if `len(lst)` is 1. Consequently, the overall behavior is to verify whether all elements at odd indices are odd integers while lacking explicit safeguards for lists of insufficient length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
