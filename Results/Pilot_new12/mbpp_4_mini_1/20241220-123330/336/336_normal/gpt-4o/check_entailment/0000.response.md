Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to check if every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. However, the implementation is incorrect in its logic because it returns `True` even when the last element is at an odd index. 

For example, consider the case `func_1([2, 1, 4])`. In this case:
- Index 1 (the odd index) contains `1`, which is odd, so according to the function, it would return `True`.

However, if we consider the input `[2, 4, 6]`, where there is no odd index in length, the program would simply not check anything and thus would return `True` as well, despite the presence of an even number at the odd index position.

Therefore, the program does not correctly follow the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
