Correctness: **True**

The logic of the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index of the list contains odd numbers. Here's the breakdown:

- The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 and increments the index by 2 (`for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):`). This ensures that it only checks odd indices.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current odd index (`lst[i]`) is even (`if lst[i] % 2 == 0:`). If it finds an even number at any of these indices, it returns `False`.
- If it does not find any even numbers at the specified indices within the loop, it returns `True`.

We can verify the assertions provided:

1. For the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`: 
   - Odd indices are 1, 3, 5, 7, which contain 1, 3, 7, 3 respectively (all are odd).
   - Returns `True`.

2. For the list `[4, 1, 2]`: 
   - Odd index is only 1 which contains 1 (is odd).
   - Returns `True`.

3. For the list `[1, 2, 3]`: 
   - Odd index is 1 which contains 2 (is even).
   - Returns `False`.

Since the program functions correctly for all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem description, it is deemed to be correct for every potential case conforming to the logic described. Thus, the conclusion is that the code works as expected.

In summary, the function accurately checks that all elements at odd indices are odd numbers, leading to the determination of correctness.
