Based on the original assessment, the program indeed does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is expected to verify that every odd index of a given list contains an odd number. However, it fails to account for cases where the list has an even length or where there are no elements at odd indices.

The original assessment claims that the implementation incorrectly returns `True` even under circumstances where there are elements at odd indices that do not satisfy the requirement. This assertion holds because the function does return `True` if it is called with an odd-length list that has odd numbers at every odd index, while it ignores altogether the list conditions where even lengths might lead to situations where there are odd indices but no items to check against.

The annotations further confirm this issue by noting a potential lack of handling for lists with less than two elements, which can lead to misleading `True` results without proper validation. Specifically, the program returns `True` in cases where it does not check at all the elements at odd indices because there may be no such indices present (in the case of a single-element list). 

Given these evaluations from the original assessment, the annotations, and a critical look at how the program interacts with its intended function, I maintain that the program is not correct in its execution.

Final: **False**
