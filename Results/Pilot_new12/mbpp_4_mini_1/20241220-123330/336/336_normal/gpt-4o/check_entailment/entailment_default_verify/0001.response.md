Final: **False**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is inaccurate due to the implicit assumption about the input list's length. The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the input list has fewer than two elements, which could lead to an IndexError when iterating through odd indices. Given that odd indices only exist if the list has enough elements, the absence of an explicit check for this condition means that the program may fail for certain valid inputs. Specifically, if a list with a single element is passed, the program will attempt to access index 1, which does not exist, leading to an error instead of a predictable outcome. Therefore, despite the function correctly checking odd indices for elements being odd, the lack of handling for lists with insufficient length signifies that the program does not fully meet the robustness expected from its description, justifying a correction of the initial assessment to reflect this issue.
