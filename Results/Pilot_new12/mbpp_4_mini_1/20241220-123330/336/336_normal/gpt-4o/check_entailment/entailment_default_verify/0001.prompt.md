You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The logic of the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index of the list contains odd numbers. Here's the breakdown:

- The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 and increments the index by 2 (`for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):`). This ensures that it only checks odd indices.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current odd index (`lst[i]`) is even (`if lst[i] % 2 == 0:`). If it finds an even number at any of these indices, it returns `False`.
- If it does not find any even numbers at the specified indices within the loop, it returns `True`.

We can verify the assertions provided:

1. For the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`: 
   - Odd indices are 1, 3, 5, 7, which contain 1, 3, 7, 3 respectively (all are odd).
   - Returns `True`.

2. For the list `[4, 1, 2]`: 
   - Odd index is only 1 which contains 1 (is odd).
   - Returns `True`.

3. For the list `[1, 2, 3]`: 
   - Odd index is 1 which contains 2 (is even).
   - Returns `False`.

Since the program functions correctly for all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem description, it is deemed to be correct for every potential case conforming to the logic described. Thus, the conclusion is that the code works as expected.

In summary, the function accurately checks that all elements at odd indices are odd numbers, leading to the determination of correctness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks the parity of elements located at odd indices. Specifically, it iterates over the odd indices of the list, and if it encounters any even integer at these indices, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it concludes by returning `True`. It is important to note that there is an implicit assumption that the input list `lst` has a length greater than one; if the list has fewer than two elements, the function behaves with no explicit handling for this edge case, which could lead to an IndexError during iteration if `len(lst)` is 1. Consequently, the overall behavior is to verify whether all elements at odd indices are odd integers while lacking explicit safeguards for lists of insufficient length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
