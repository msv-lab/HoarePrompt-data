Correctness: **False**

The provided program is expected to check whether every element located at odd indices of a list contains odd numbers. The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the odd indices and returns `False` if it finds any even number at those positions. However, it fails to handle the case where the length of the list is less than 2, which could lead to an `IndexError`. 

For instance, when the input list is `[1]`, the function does not explicitly handle this case, and trying to check the index will cause an error. Hence, the function does not have correct behavior for all potential cases, specifically for lists with fewer than two elements. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
