Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description fully. The function `func_1` is designed to check if every element at odd indices of the given list is odd. However, the test cases provided do not consistently match the requirement described in the problem statement.

1. The program checks every odd index and returns `False` if any of those indices contain an even number. This is correct behavior. However, the function returns `True` when the list has an odd count of numbers at odd indices; it does not take the specific requirement of checking for odd integers at odd indices into account properly, as evidenced by the second test case: 

   - `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: This case is incorrect because the element at index `1` (which is `1`, an odd number), is odd, but the element at index `3` (which is non-existent in this case) does not count as a failure. This means the function should have returned `True`, but this does not satisfy the requirement that "every odd index contains odd numbers" since the input list has even indices without a proper value.
  
2. The test case `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` correctly returns `True` because positions `1`, `3`, `5`, and `7` are indeed odd, and their values `1`, `3`, `7`, and `3` are odd numbers.

3. The test case `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` which is accurate because index `1` has the value `2` which is an even number.

However, the discrepancy between odd indices and their respective values does not represent the problem description accurately in all contexts. The function's handling of the second test case (even indices without clear odd values) is what primarily leads to the conclusion that the function does not fully adhere to the problem description and therefore it is incorrect. 

A corrected version of the function should ensure that it specifically validates every odd index without exception or incorrect assumptions about non-existent indices leading to an automatic true validation.
