Based on the provided problem description, the program's functionality, and the annotations, the evaluation of correctness can be summarized as follows:

The problem description requires a function that checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function `func_1` scans through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and verifies each odd-indexed element. It returns `False` if any of these elements are even and `True` if all are odd.

The original assessment claimed correctness (True), which appears to be valid given the function's logic and the correctness of the assertions. The detailed breakdown in the assessment correctly explains how the function iterates through the list and conditions under which it returns.

The annotated version further reinforces this evaluation, clearly stating the state of the input list and confirming that if no even numbers are found at the odd indices, the function will return `True` as expected.

The specific test cases provided:
1. For the input `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the odd indexed values are 1 (index 1), 3 (index 3), 7 (index 5), and 3 (index 7), all of which are odd; therefore, the returned value is `True`.
2. For `[4, 1, 2]`, the only odd indexed value is 1 (index 1), which is odd; hence the return value is `True`.
3. For `[1, 2, 3]`, the odd indexed value is 2 (index 1), which is even; thus, the return value is `False`.

Since all the assertions hold true and the program accurately checks the conditions set forth in the problem description, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
