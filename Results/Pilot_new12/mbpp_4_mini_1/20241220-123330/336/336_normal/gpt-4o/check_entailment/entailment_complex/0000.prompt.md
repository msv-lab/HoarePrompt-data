You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, and all elements at odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at these odd indices is even, the function would have returned False; otherwise, it continues past the loop without returning.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements at the odd indices of the list `lst` are odd integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks the parity of elements located at odd indices. Specifically, it iterates over the odd indices of the list, and if it encounters any even integer at these indices, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even integers, it concludes by returning `True`. It is important to note that there is an implicit assumption that the input list `lst` has a length greater than one; if the list has fewer than two elements, the function behaves with no explicit handling for this edge case, which could lead to an IndexError during iteration if `len(lst)` is 1. Consequently, the overall behavior is to verify whether all elements at odd indices are odd integers while lacking explicit safeguards for lists of insufficient length.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
