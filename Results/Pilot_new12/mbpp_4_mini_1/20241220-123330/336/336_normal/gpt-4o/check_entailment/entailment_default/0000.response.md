The code provided in the function `func_1` is intended to check whether every element located at odd indices of a given list contains odd numbers. It iterates through the elements at odd indices and returns `False` if any of those elements are even; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The output hints clarify that the function will immediately return `False` when an even integer is found at an odd index, and will return `True` if all checked elements at odd indices are odd. Furthermore, the hints note that there is an implicit assumption that the list has a length greater than one, which could lead to problems if the length is one or fewer, although the code does not explicitly handle this edge case.

Let's evaluate the correctness based on the potential cases:

1. **Example with odd-indexed even number:** If we test an input like `[2, 2]`, the function will evaluate index 1 (which is 2) and return `False`. This is correct behavior.
   
2. **Example with a single element:** For an input like `[1]`, the loop won't run at all as there are no odd indices, and it will return `True`. This behavior is flawed as it does not truly check the condition presented in the problem description when the list length is less than 2.

3. **Example where all odd indices are odd:** Given the input `[2, 1, 4, 3]`, the second index (odd index 1) is 1 (odd), and index 3 is 3 (odd), returning `True`, which is correct.

4. **Valid input condition assumptions:** The code assumes valid input, but the lack of handling for lists shorter than two elements can lead to ambiguous results without appropriate checks.

Since there is a demonstrated edge case where the condition is not correctly checked (specifically lists of length one), and according to the output hints about the functional assumption, we must conclude that the program does not adhere to the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
