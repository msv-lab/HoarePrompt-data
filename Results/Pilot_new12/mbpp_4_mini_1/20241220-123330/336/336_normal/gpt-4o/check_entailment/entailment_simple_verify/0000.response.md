Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to return `True` if every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. However, the logic does not handle cases correctly where the length of the list is 2 or less. Specifically:

1. The program would return `True` for the input `[2, 4, 6]` because there are no odd indices to check, thus it does not verify the condition for elements at odd indices, which returns incorrectly.
2. In the annotated version, it states that if there are no elements at odd indices, it continues past the loop without returning, which incorrectly implies that the absence of odd indexed elements is satisfactory for returning `True`.
3. It misses cases where there might be even numbers present at odd indices when they exist beyond the first odd index, which further invalidates its correctness.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description consistently across all cases, affirming that the initial assessment of the program's correctness is indeed **False**.
