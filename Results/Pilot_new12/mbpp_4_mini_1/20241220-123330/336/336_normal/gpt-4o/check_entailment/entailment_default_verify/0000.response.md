Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the implementation of the function `func_1` fails to handle the case where there are no odd indices to check. Specifically, if the list has fewer than two elements, the function does not provide proper handling and can return `True` without evaluating any indices, even when such a scenario may intuitively require a different response. Furthermore, the logic does not account for lists with even lengths or edge cases, potentially leading to misunderstandings about whether all odd-indexed values are odd.

According to the output hints, while the function iterates over odd indices checking for even numbers and correctly returns `False` for cases where an even number is found, it can also incorrectly conclude the evaluation if the length of the list is insufficient to provide any odd indices. This characteristic aligns with the original assessment that emphasized the function's limitations in accurately implementing the described behavior for all potential cases.
