You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is supposed to check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the list has an odd length and ends with an even number at the last odd index. 

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. 
- The indices are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- The odd indices are: 1, 3, 5
- The numbers at these indices are 2 (even), 4 (even), and 6 (even).

According to the problem's requirement, there should not be any even number at an odd index. Since the program incorrectly treats these even numbers as valid, it will return `True` instead of `False`. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for this case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, it must have an even number of elements for the loop not to return False, if the list has an odd number of elements, the loop has executed `len(lst)` times, and the last value of `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. If the loop does not return False, it means all odd indices either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices, confirming that the list has an even number of elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and performs a validation check on the integers located at odd indices. It scans through the list and returns `False` if it encounters an even integer at any odd index. If the list has an odd number of elements, the function will complete the loop without returning `False`, and it will subsequently return `True`. Thus, the function only returns `True` when all odd indices contain odd integers, or when even integers appear exclusively at even indices, effectively validating the arrangement of integers in the list. Notably, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list is empty, which could lead to a return of `True` since there would be no odd indexed integers to contradict the conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
