Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which states that every odd index must contain odd numbers. 

Here's the issue with the program:

1. The condition inside the loop checks that if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`), then the value at that index (`lst[i]`) should not be even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If this condition fails, the function returns `False`, which is correct.
   
2. However, the program does not explicitly check if the odd indices contain odd numbers. Instead, it will also return `True` if no odd indices are present, such as in the case of a list with only even indices (for example, `lst = [2, 4, 6]`). In this case, the program will execute without any failures because there are no odd indices to check, and it will return `True` incorrectly.

3. The problem description requires that every odd index in the list must contain an odd number. The program fails to enforce this requirement because it doesn't check every odd index (which does not exist if the list length is even) or ensure the values at existing odd indices are odd.

Therefore, since there are cases (like the one illustrated) where the program does not meet the criteria outlined in the problem statement, the conclusion is that the program does not satisfy the requirement.

In summary, due to the incomplete checks and lack of consideration for lists with no odd indices leading to misleading results, the program is incorrect as per the provided problem description.
