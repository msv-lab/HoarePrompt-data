Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, if the list is empty, the function will incorrectly return `True`, as it completes the loop without encountering any violations.

For example:
- Input: `[]` (an empty list) should theoretically be considered incorrect because there are no odd indexed numbers to validate, leading to ambiguity in defining correctness. 

Since the code does not fulfill the requirement for all possible cases, including the empty list case, it results in an incorrect implementation. Thus, the output for correctness is **False**.
