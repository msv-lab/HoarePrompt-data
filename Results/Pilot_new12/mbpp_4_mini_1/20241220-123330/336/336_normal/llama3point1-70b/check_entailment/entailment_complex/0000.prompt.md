You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, it must have an even number of elements for the loop not to return False, if the list has an odd number of elements, the loop has executed `len(lst)` times, and the last value of `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. If the loop does not return False, it means all odd indices either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices, confirming that the list has an even number of elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and performs a validation check on the integers located at odd indices. It scans through the list and returns `False` if it encounters an even integer at any odd index. If the list has an odd number of elements, the function will complete the loop without returning `False`, and it will subsequently return `True`. Thus, the function only returns `True` when all odd indices contain odd integers, or when even integers appear exclusively at even indices, effectively validating the arrangement of integers in the list. Notably, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list is empty, which could lead to a return of `True` since there would be no odd indexed integers to contradict the conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
