Explanation: The code correctly checks whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers, as per the problem description. The function iterates through each index in the list and evaluates if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the corresponding value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it promptly returns `False`. If it completes the loop without encountering any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`, which correctly indicates that all odd indices contain odd integers or that there are no odd indices in the case of an empty list.

However, the function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list. In Python, accessing indices in an empty list would be safe, as the loop would not run at all, which results in `True`. This behavior is consistent with the problem statement, as technically, there are no odd indices to contradict the conditions. 

Thus, since the function meets the required behavior specified in the problem description for all potential valid cases, it should be considered accurate, yielding `True`.

Correctness: **True**.
