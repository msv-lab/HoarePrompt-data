Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is supposed to check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the list has an odd length and ends with an even number at the last odd index. 

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. 
- The indices are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- The odd indices are: 1, 3, 5
- The numbers at these indices are 2 (even), 4 (even), and 6 (even).

According to the problem's requirement, there should not be any even number at an odd index. Since the program incorrectly treats these even numbers as valid, it will return `True` instead of `False`. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for this case, making it incorrect.
