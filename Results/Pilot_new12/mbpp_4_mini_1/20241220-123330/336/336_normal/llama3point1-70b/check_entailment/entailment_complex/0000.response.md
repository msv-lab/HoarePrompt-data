Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which states that every odd index must contain odd numbers. However, the program incorrectly returns `True` in cases where there are any even integers at odd indices, as long as even integers only appear at even indices, which does not adhere to the problem specification.

Specifically:
- The function checks if the value at an odd index (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`, which is good.
- However, the function then incorrectly returns `True` if it completes the loop without returning `False`, including scenarios where there could be odd integers at odd indices and even integers at odd indices, which contradicts the explicit requirement of the problem description that every odd index must contain an odd number.

Counterexample:
- Consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Here:
  - At odd index 1, there is an even number (2), which should result in the function returning `False`. However, with the current implementation, it would check index 1, return `False`, and subsequently return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description requirements.

Thus, the function does not consistently ensure that every odd index contains only odd numbers, leading to a discrepancy in fulfilling the problem's requirements.
