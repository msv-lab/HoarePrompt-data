To determine the correctness of the provided program, we start by analyzing the problem description and the corresponding implementation.

**Problem Description:** The task is to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

- The loop iterates over all indices of the list.
- It checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`), which is correct.
- Then, it checks if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
- If it encounters any odd index that contains an even number, it returns `False`.
- If no such case is found, it returns `True`.

**Testing for Edge Cases:**
1. If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `func_1(lst)` checks:
   - Index `1` (value `2`): It is an odd index with an even value. The function should return `False`.
   
2. If `lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, `func_1(lst)` checks:
   - Index `1` (value `1`): It is an odd index with an odd value, continues.
   - Index `3` (value `3`): It is an odd index with an odd value. The function should return `True`.

3. For an empty list `lst = []`, it should return `True` because there are no indices to check.

4. If `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, then all odd indices contain odd numbers, so it should return `True`.

5. A problematic case: If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5]`, then:
   - Index `1` (value `2`): This is an odd index with an even value, the function should return `False`.

The implementation appears to correctly identify the odd indices and validate their contents based on the provided problem description.

**Conclusion:** After considering various inputs and edge cases, it seems that the program correctly fulfills the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
