The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and performs a validation check on the integers located at odd indices. It scans through the list and returns `False` if it encounters an even integer at any odd index. If the list has an odd number of elements, the function will complete the loop without returning `False`, and it will subsequently return `True`. Thus, the function only returns `True` when all odd indices contain odd integers, or when even integers appear exclusively at even indices, effectively validating the arrangement of integers in the list. Notably, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list is empty, which could lead to a return of `True` since there would be no odd indexed integers to contradict the conditions.
