#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, it must have an even number of elements for the loop not to return False, if the list has an odd number of elements, the loop has executed `len(lst)` times, and the last value of `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. If the loop does not return False, it means all odd indices either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices, confirming that the list has an even number of elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and performs a validation check on the integers located at odd indices. It scans through the list and returns `False` if it encounters an even integer at any odd index. If the list has an odd number of elements, the function will complete the loop without returning `False`, and it will subsequently return `True`. Thus, the function only returns `True` when all odd indices contain odd integers, or when even integers appear exclusively at even indices, effectively validating the arrangement of integers in the list. Notably, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list is empty, which could lead to a return of `True` since there would be no odd indexed integers to contradict the conditions.
