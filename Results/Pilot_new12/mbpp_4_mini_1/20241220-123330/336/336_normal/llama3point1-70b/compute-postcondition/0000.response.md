According to the code, the loop iterates based on the length of the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must have at least one integer. After the last iteration, the value of `i` will equal `len(lst) - 1`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `lst` must contain at least 1 integer, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
