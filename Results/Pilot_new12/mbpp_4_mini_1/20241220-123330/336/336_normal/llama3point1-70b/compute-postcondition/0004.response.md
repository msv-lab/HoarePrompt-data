According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. The loop will iterate over the elements of `lst` using the index `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and it is known that `lst` must have at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1 to 1, and the length of the list `lst` must be at least 2 to cover the next index.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
