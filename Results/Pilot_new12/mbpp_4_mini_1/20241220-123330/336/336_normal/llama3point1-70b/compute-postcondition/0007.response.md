According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of `lst`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `lst` has at least 2 elements, meaning the length of `lst` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

So, if `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it will become 2 for the next iteration. We need to ensure that the length of `lst` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
