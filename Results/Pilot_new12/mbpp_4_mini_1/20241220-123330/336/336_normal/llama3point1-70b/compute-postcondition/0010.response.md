Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, it must have an even number of elements for the loop not to return False, if the list has an odd number of elements, the loop has executed `len(lst)` times, and the last value of `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. If the loop does not return False, it means all odd indices either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices.**
