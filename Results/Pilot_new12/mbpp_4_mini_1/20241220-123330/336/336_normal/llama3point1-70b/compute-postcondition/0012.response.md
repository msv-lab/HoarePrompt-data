The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function has multiple return cases: if certain conditions are met, it may return `False` in three different cases (Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3). If none of those cases are satisfied and the conditions specified in Case_4 are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices in the list either have odd values or even values only appear at even indices, and confirming that the list has an even number of elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers and determine if it meets the criteria for returning `True` or `False` based on the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and returns `False` in three cases if certain conditions are not met; otherwise, it returns `True`, confirming the arrangement of odd and even integers in the list.**
