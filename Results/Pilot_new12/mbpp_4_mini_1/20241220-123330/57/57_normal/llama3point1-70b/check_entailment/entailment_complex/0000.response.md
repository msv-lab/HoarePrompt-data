Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list that contains sublists of strings. The function sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner without modifying the original input. 

Here's a breakdown of how it fulfills the problem requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function expects a valid input of a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. There is no indication of any input validation needed since the problem states we assume the inputs will be valid.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program uses Python's built-in `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive, which is a crucial requirement from the problem description.

3. **Return Structure**: It returns a new list of lists. This adheres to the problem requirement, as it does not modify the original `list_of_lists`, maintaining the integrity of the original data.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: Although the annotations mention that the function does not handle empty sublists or non-string elements, the assumption is that valid inputs will only be present. Therefore, even if the function behaves unexpectedly with edge cases, this is not a factor since we are assuming the input is valid.

Overall, the function correctly sorts each sublist as specified without altering the original data structure, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description.
