Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists or non-string elements within the sublists. For example:

1. If a sublist is empty (e.g., `[]`), the program correctly returns `[]` for that sublist, but it ignores that this is a special case of sorting an empty list.
2. If a sublist contains non-string elements (e.g., `[1, 'apple', 'Banana']`), the `sorted` function would raise a `TypeError` when trying to compare the integer `1` with the string elements during sorting.

Thus, because the program does not account for these potential cases, which might lead to unexpected behavior, it is deemed incorrect.
