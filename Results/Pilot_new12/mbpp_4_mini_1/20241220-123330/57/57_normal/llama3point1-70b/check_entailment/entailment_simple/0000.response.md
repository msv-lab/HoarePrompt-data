Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input, where each sublist is expected to contain strings. 

1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
2. For each `sublist`, it applies the `sorted` function with a key of `str.lower`, ensuring that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner. This is in line with the requirement to sort each sublist of strings.
3. The output is a new list containing the sorted sublists, which conforms to the goal of the problem description.

Since the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings as specified, it meets the problem requirements effectively and correctly.
