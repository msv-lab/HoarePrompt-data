Correctness: **True**.

The program takes a list of lists as input and sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner using `str.lower` as the sorting key. This means that it will correctly sort strings irrespective of their character cases.

For instance, given the input `[['apple', 'Banana', 'cherry'], ['date', 'Elderberry', 'fig']]`, the output will be `[['apple', 'Banana', 'cherry'], ['date', 'Elderberry', 'fig']]` which is correctly sorted as `[['Banana', 'apple', 'cherry'], ['date', 'Elderberry', 'fig']]` when sorted case insensitively. 

The code effectively handles all variations of string cases and sorts them appropriately within each sublist, meaning it satisfies the requirements of the problem description. Since I cannot think of any potential case where it would fail, the correctness is deemed to be true.
