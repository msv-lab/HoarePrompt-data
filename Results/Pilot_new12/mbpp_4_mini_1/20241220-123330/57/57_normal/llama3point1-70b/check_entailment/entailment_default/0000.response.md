Explanation: The code provided for the problem description is essentially correct for the main requirement of sorting each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner. The use of the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is done without regard to case, aligning well with the problem description. Additionally, the use of list comprehension allows for an elegant transformation of the input list into the desired output format without modifying the original list.

However, while the code handles the main functionality as specified, the output hints point out a critical shortcoming. The code does not account for edge cases like empty sublists or non-string elements within those sublists. If a sublist is empty, the code will correctly return an empty sublist, but if it contains non-string elements, this will raise an error during the sorting process since `str.lower()` specifically expects string inputs. Therefore, while the primary requirements are met, the program is not robust enough to handle all potential cases effectively.

Correctness: **False**.
