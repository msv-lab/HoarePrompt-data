Final: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. The annotations indicate that `list_of_lists` is indeed a list containing sublists of strings, confirming that the input assumptions hold. The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures case-insensitive sorting, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

The provided example test cases further illustrate this behavior, demonstrating that the function sorts strings accurately regardless of their case. The original assessment of the program being correct is supported by both the annotated version and the reasoning provided. Thus, the program's correctness remains affirmed.
