#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner using the `str.lower` method as the sorting key. The function performs this operation without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists or non-string elements within the sublists, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are present.
