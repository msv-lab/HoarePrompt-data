The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner using the `str.lower` method as the sorting key. The function performs this operation without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists or non-string elements within the sublists, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are present.
