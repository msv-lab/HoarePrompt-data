#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list containing sublists of strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The function does not handle cases where an element in `list_of_lists` is not a list or where a sublist might be empty; thus, it will simply return an empty sublist in such cases without any error. The overall result maintains the structure of the original list but with each sublist sorted.
