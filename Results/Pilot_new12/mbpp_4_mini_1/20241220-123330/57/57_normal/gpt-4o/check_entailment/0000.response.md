Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. However, the output of the function does not match this specification in all cases. For example:

- In the first assertion, `func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']))` outputs the expected `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is correct.
- In the second assertion, `func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']))` does not sort the strings correctly because it retains leading and trailing spaces as part of the string comparison. The result should have been sorted based only on the strings aside from the spaces, but it returns the input sublists with spaces intact (disregarding standard sorting behavior).
  
  A potential corrected output would need removal of the spaces before sorting, thus the expected output is not returned.

- In the third assertion, `func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze']))`, while the output is correct, it does not account for any potential edge cases like case sensitivity which may impact the ordering if mixed case strings are present.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not perform correctly according to the problem description, the program is deemed incorrect.
