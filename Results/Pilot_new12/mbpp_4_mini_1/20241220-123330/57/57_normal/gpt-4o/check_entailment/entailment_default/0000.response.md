The provided program aims to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Upon reviewing the code, it appears to use a list comprehension to apply the `sorted()` function to each sublist. 

Output hints indicate that while the function will return a new list of sorted sublists, it does not handle cases where an element in `list_of_lists` is not a list or where a sublist might be empty. Specifically, if a non-list element is present, the `sorted()` function will raise a TypeError. Additionally, if a sublist is empty, the function will return an empty sublist without any error which might not match with the original intention to sort meaningful strings.

Here, we can identify the potential edge cases outlined in the hints:
1. If `list_of_lists` contains a non-list element, the program will throw an error and not sort as intended.
2. The program does not address the sorting of empty sublists to ensure they meet expected output consistency.

As such, there are cases where the program fails to deliver according to the problem description, particularly concerning non-list elements in the `list_of_lists`.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
