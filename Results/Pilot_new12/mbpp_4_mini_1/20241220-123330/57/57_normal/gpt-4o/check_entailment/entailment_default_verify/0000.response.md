The original assessment deemed the program's correctness as **False**, and upon reviewing the problem description, the program behavior, and the output hints, I find that the original assessment is indeed accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Sorting Mechanism**: The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function. However, as noted in the original assessment, while the function sorts strings, it does so with respect to whitespace (leading/trailing spaces) which can affect the output. For example, in the second assertion, the strings are not sorted correctly because the extra spaces are taken into account.

2. **Consistency with Outputs**: The first assertion provides the expected output, but the other assertions do not consistently align with a true sorting behavior as would be expected from the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**: The discussion on case sensitivity touches upon the fact that if mixed-case strings were involved, the sorting could yield undesired results. This is a consideration mentioned in the original assessment that indicates a gap in the expected functionality.

4. **Output Hints Alignment**: The output hints specify the function's expected behavior but also mention that it does not manage cases where sublists might be empty or contain invalid elements. While the assumption is made that valid input is always provided, the core functionality intended by the problem is not satisfied by the current implementation.

Based on the above rationale, the assessments remain valid. The program does not fully meet the objectives detailed in the problem description due to improper handling of string comparisons which can include leading and trailing white spaces, consequently affecting the correctness of sorted outputs for the given assertions. Therefore, the final conclusion remains:

Final: **False**
