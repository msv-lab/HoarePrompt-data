Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists. However, it does not consider several edge cases that may lead to incorrect outputs. 

For example, if an empty sublist is passed in the input, the `sorted` function will return an empty sublist, as expected, but this doesn't match the intent of sorting and maintaining the structure in a meaningful way if the rest of the inputs have values. Additionally, if a non-list element is included in the main list, such as an integer or a string, the program would still execute but would not handle these gracefully, resulting in not sorting the structure correctly.

Output hints suggest that the function does not handle cases where elements in `list_of_lists` are not lists or where sublists may be empty (resulting in silent handling rather than an error or default behavior). Given that the original problem statement implies a structured sorting of the original list inputs, any discrepancies in handling non-list elements or leading/trailing spaces could lead to additional issues. 

Thus, the requirement is not fully met for every potential case, leading to `Correctness: False`.
