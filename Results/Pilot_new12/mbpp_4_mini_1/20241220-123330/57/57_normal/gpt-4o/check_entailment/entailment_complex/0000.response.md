The program provided correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to write a function that sorts each sublist of strings within a list of lists.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is assumed to be a list of lists where each sublist contains strings.
   - The implementation uses a list comprehension along with the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist in ascending order.
   - The function returns a new list where each sublist is independently sorted, preserving the original structure of `list_of_lists`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided test the function with various cases, including:
     - Sublists with different strings that should be sorted.
     - Sublists with mixed spaces around the strings that should also be sorted correctly while maintaining the whitespaces.
     - Sublists that contain various strings which need to be sorted alphabetically.
   - All assertions are expected to be true given the logic of the function.

4. **Handling Potential Issues**: 
   - The function does not explicitly handle cases of empty sublists or cases where elements are not sublists, but as noted, the problem states that valid input will be assumed. Thus, for the expected valid input as specified in the problem description, the function will operate as intended.

Since the implementation aligns perfectly with the expectations set forth in the problem description and correctly sorts each sublist, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True** 

The function fulfills the requirement to sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists, complying with the problem description.
