Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirement to sort each sublist of strings correctly. The underlying issue is the handling of leading and trailing spaces in strings, which affects the sorting results. 

In the second assertion example given in the original assessment, the function retains the spaces in the strings and does not sort them by ignoring these spaces, leading to incorrect sorting behavior. The function should ideally strip leading and trailing whitespace before sorting to align with typical string sorting practices. 

Therefore, the function's inability to handle these cases correctly warrants the conclusion that the program is indeed incorrect, supporting the original assessment's classification of the program's correctness as **False**.
