Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description regarding the sorting of sublists. According to the problem, it is required to sort each sublist of strings in ascending order. However, the output of the assertions includes sublists where the strings are not sorted correctly.

For example:
1. In the first assertion, the expected output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but the expected output includes a sublist `['black', 'orange', 'white']` which is not sorted. The correct sorted version should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`.
   
2. Similarly, in the second assertion, the expected output `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` has not been organized in a consistently sorted order when spaces in the strings are considered.
   
In addition, when sorting strings, leading and trailing spaces can affect alphabetical order, which is not considered in these test cases.

Thus, the function does not satisfy the sorting requirement for all sublists as described in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
