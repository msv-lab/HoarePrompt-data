Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not sort the sublists correctly in the second test case provided. It retains leading and trailing spaces which impact the sorting outcome, leading to incorrect results according to the problem description. Specifically, the function sorts based on the original strings that include spaces, which does not align with the expected behavior of sorting strings without regard to surrounding whitespace. Additionally, while the third test case may produce the correct output under normal circumstances, the lack of handling for potential edge cases (like mixed-case strings) suggests the program could behave incorrectly with a different set of inputs. Therefore, the conclusion that the program is incorrect remains valid.
