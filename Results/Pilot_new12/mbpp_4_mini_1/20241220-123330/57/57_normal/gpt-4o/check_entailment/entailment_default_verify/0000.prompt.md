You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. However, the output of the function does not match this specification in all cases. For example:

- In the first assertion, `func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']))` outputs the expected `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is correct.
- In the second assertion, `func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']))` does not sort the strings correctly because it retains leading and trailing spaces as part of the string comparison. The result should have been sorted based only on the strings aside from the spaces, but it returns the input sublists with spaces intact (disregarding standard sorting behavior).
  
  A potential corrected output would need removal of the spaces before sorting, thus the expected output is not returned.

- In the third assertion, `func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze']))`, while the output is correct, it does not account for any potential edge cases like case sensitivity which may impact the ordering if mixed case strings are present.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not perform correctly according to the problem description, the program is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list containing sublists of strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The function does not handle cases where an element in `list_of_lists` is not a list or where a sublist might be empty; thus, it will simply return an empty sublist in such cases without any error. The overall result maintains the structure of the original list but with each sublist sorted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
