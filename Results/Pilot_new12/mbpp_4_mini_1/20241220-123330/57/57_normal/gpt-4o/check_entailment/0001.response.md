Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the `sorted()` function returns a new list of sorted strings, but it also disregards leading and trailing spaces in the strings, which can affect the expected output for certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```python
([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])
```
The expected output based on the assertions would be:
```python
[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
```
However, when using the current implementation, the sorting algorithm will remove the spaces, leading to incorrect results that may not reflect the original string state as described. 

Specifically, the output from the function would be:
```python
[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', 'orange']]
```
The second sublist is incorrect due to how 'black' and 'blue' are sorted together.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where leading or trailing spaces in strings are significant, leading to the conclusion that the solution is incorrect overall. 

Therefore, the final verdict is that the program is not accurate for all potential cases.
