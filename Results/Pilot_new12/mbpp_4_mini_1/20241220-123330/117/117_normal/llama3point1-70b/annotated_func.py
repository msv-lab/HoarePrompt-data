#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain various types of elements, including integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list that may contain various types of elements, including integers. It counts and returns the total number of integer elements present in the list. If the list is empty or contains no integers, it will return 0. The function does not account for nested lists or other iterable types, as it only checks the top-level elements of the list. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the count of integer elements in the list `lst` is returned.
