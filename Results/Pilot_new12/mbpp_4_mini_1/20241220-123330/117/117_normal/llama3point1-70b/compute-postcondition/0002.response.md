Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list that may contain various types of elements, including integers. It counts and returns the total number of integer elements present in the list. If the list is empty or contains no integers, it will return 0. The function does not account for nested lists or other iterable types, as it only checks the top-level elements of the list. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the count of integer elements in the list `lst` is returned.**
