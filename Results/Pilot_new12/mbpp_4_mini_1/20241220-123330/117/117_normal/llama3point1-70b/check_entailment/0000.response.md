Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list. It iterates through each element of the list and uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if each element `x` is an integer. The `sum` function aggregates the boolean results (converted to integers 1 for True and 0 for False), thus accurately returning the count of integer elements. 

All potential cases, including empty lists, lists with mixed types, and lists containing only integers, are handled correctly. Therefore, the function meets the problem description requirements.
