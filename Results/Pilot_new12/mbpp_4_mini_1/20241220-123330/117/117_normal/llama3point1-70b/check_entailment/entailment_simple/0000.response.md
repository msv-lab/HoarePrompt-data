Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to return the number of integer elements present in the list `lst`.

Here is how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single input parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing various types of elements. The problem description explicitly states that the input will be valid.

2. **Counting Integers**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function. It iterates over each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. For each integer found, it produces a value of `1` (True), and for non-integer elements, it produces a value of `0` (False).

3. **Returning the Count**: The `sum()` function totals all the `1`s, effectively counting how many integers are present in the list. This directly fulfills the requirement of returning the count of integer elements in the list.

Since it adheres to the problem description and accurately counts only integer types in the provided list, the conclusion is that the program is correct. Thus, we report the correctness as **True**.
