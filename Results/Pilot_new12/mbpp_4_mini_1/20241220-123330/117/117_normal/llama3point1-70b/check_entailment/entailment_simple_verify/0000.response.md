Based on the problem description and the evaluation of the program provided, I will analyze whether the program fulfills the criteria of returning the number of integer elements in a given list.

The function `func_1` is written to iterate over each element in the list `lst` and checks if each element is an instance of `int`. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum` function, effectively counting how many elements are of type integer since `isinstance` returns `True` (1) for integers and `False` (0) for non-integers.

The annotations support the understanding that the function is precisely designed to return the count of integers, and there is explicit mention that it handles various types of elements, including both integers and non-integers.

The original assessment claims that the function's correctness is **True**, and evaluating it against the problem description, the program is indeed correct as it counts the number of integers effectively.

With the above reasoning and the provided annotations, I can assert that all key points align, and thus the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
