#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements which may include integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that may include various data types. It evaluates the contents of the list and counts the number of elements that are integers. The function returns this count as an integer. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input `lst` is not a listâ€”this may lead to a TypeError if the input type is incompatible. However, assuming `lst` is a list, the function correctly calculates the number of integer elements contained within. After execution, the final state of the program includes the integer result representing the count of integers found in the input list.
