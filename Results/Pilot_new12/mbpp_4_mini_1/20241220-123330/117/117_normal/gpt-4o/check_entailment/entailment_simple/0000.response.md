Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must return the number of integer elements in a given list. The program achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to count how many of the elements in the list `lst` are instances of the `int` type. 

Let's analyze how it fulfills the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements. It assumes, as per the problem description, that the input will always be valid.

2. **Integer Count Logic**: The expression `sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))` iterates over each element `x` in the list. For every element that is an integer (determined by `isinstance(x, int)`), it contributes a count of `1` to the sum. 

3. **Expected Output**: The final result of `func_1` is the total count of integers in the list, which matches the requirement of returning the number of integer elements.

All assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various lists, confirming its correctness. 

Thus, the program effectively addresses the problem requirements, making it correct according to the described behavior.
