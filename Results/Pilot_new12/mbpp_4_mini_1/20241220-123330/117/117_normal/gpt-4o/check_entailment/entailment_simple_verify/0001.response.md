Based on the problem description, the function `func_1(lst)` is designed to count the number of integer elements in a list. The original assessment concluded that the program's correctness is **True**, stating that the function accurately counts integer elements and handles non-integer types.

The provided annotations support this conclusion:

1. The assertions are correctly specified, and they align with the expected resultsâ€”each call to `func_1` with the specified input returns the correct count of integer elements.
   
2. The logic within the function uses `isinstance(x, int)` effectively to filter out non-integer types before counting, which is the desired behavior as per the problem description.

3. The annotated statement indicates that just before invoking the function, 'lst' is indeed a list, which upholds the expectation that the input will be valid, falling in line with the assumptions noted in the task.

Given that the assertions are validated against the function behavior and that the annotations confirm the intended processing of elements in accordance with the problem description, the original assessment stands accurate.

Hence, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
