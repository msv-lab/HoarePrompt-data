Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list by using a generator expression that checks the `isinstance(x, int)` condition for each element in the list `lst`. 

I have reviewed the assertions provided in the program:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2`, which is correct as there are two integers (1 and 2).
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3`, which is correct as there are three integers (1, 2, and 3).
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2`, which is correct as there are two integers (1 and 4).

Furthermore, the function handles different types of non-integer elements (like strings and floats) appropriately, counting only integer elements. I cannot think of any edge cases where the function fails to behave as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
