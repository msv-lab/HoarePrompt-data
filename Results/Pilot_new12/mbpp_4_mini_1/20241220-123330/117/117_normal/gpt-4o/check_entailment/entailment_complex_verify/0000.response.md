Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program correctly implements the function `func_1` that counts the number of integer elements in a list as specified in the problem description. The generator expression `sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))` effectively filters and counts the integers, yielding correct results as confirmed by the provided assertions. 

The annotations further clarify the behavior of the function, emphasizing that it expects a valid list input and correctly returns the count of integer elements. While it notes the lack of error handling for non-list inputs, the assumption that input will always be valid suffices to maintain the function's correctness.

Given that the assertions validate the expected results for given inputs and the function behaves as intended according to the problem description, the assessment of correctness is justified.
