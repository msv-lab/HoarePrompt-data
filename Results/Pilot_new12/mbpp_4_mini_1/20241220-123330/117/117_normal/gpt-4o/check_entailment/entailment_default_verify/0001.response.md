Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It successfully counts the number of integer elements in the provided list, ensuring that it only includes types that are integers by checking `isinstance(x, int)` for each element.

The assertions in the code confirm the expected behavior:
1. It returns the correct count of integers in the list `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, resulting in `2`.
2. It accurately counts all three integers in `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in `3`.
3. It correctly identifies two integers in the list `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]` and returns `2`.

Although the output hints indicate that the function does not handle inputs that are not lists, the problem description does not require this handling, and it is stated that we can assume valid inputs. Given these observations, the program meets the criteria laid out in the problem description and effectively fulfills its intended purpose, justifying the conclusion that the original assessment of correctness is indeed valid.
