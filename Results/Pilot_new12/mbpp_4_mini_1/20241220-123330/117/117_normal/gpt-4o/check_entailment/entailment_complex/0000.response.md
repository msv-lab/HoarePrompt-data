Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that counts the number of integer elements in a given list, which aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the input list `lst` and applies the `isinstance` function to check if each element is of type `int`. The sum of these checks gives the count of integers in the list.

Key points affirming its correctness:
1. **Functionality**: It properly counts integer types in the list, as verified through the provided assertions, which return the expected counts for different sample inputs.
2. **Input Validity**: The problem statement assumes that the input will be a valid list, and since this assumption is maintained, the lack of additional checks for input validity does not render the program incorrect under the stated conditions.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer count, which is consistent with the output expected by the problem description.

Thus, the program behaves as intended based on the specified requirements.
