Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` to filter for integers. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different cases:

1. The first assertion `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2`, which is correct since there are two integers: `1` and `2`.
2. The second assertion `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3`, correctly counting all three integers in the list.
3. The third assertion `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2`, which is also accurate as there are two integers: `1` and `4`.

The function effectively counts all integers regardless of their position in the list, and it handles various data types appropriately, returning the correct count based on the definitions of integers in Python. Thus, I cannot find a case where the code does not work as expected, confirming its correctness.
