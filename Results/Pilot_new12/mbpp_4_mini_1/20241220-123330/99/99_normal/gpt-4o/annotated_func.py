#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string composed of any characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a new string composed of characters at even indices from the original string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string composed of characters from the original string `s` that are located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty string. There are no additional error handling or edge case considerations implemented in the code.
