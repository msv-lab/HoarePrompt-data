Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the characters located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) of the input string.

The output hints confirm this design, stating that the function returns a new string composed of characters located at even indices and handles the case of an empty string by returning another empty string.

Additionally, the function has been tested with several assertions (e.g., `func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`, `func_1('python') == 'pto'`, etc.), and in all these cases, the function behaves as expected, producing the correct output.

Since the program handles all specified cases correctly, including the edge case of an empty input string, we can conclude that it is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
