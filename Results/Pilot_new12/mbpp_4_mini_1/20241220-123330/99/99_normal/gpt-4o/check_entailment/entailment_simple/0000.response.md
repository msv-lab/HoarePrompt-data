Correctness: **False**

The annotated program is not correct according to the problem description. The problem description specifically asks for a function to remove the characters that have odd index values from a given string. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` does the opposite; it collects characters from even index values instead.

In particular, here is what the code does:
- It iterates through the indices of the string `s`.
- It uses a list comprehension to include characters at indices `i` where `i % 2 == 0`, which means it returns characters at even indices.

For example:
- For the input 'abcdef', the indices are: 0 (a), 1 (b), 2 (c), 3 (d), 4 (e), 5 (f) â†’ the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are removed, which results in 'ace', but it should actually be removing odd indices.

The correct behavior according to the problem description should return a string that omits characters from odd indices. Therefore, the output for 'abcdef' should be 'bdf' (removing 'a', 'c', 'e') instead of 'ace'. 

Thus, the program is not performing what the problem description requires, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
