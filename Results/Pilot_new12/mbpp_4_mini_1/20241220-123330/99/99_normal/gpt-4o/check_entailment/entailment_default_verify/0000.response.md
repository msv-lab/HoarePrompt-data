Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function successfully removes characters from the input string that have odd index values, and only includes characters located at even indices. The supporting output hints further confirm this behavior, clarifying that the function indeed returns a new string composed of characters located at even indices and that it handles empty strings properly by returning an empty string.

Each of the test cases provided confirms the correctness of the function:
- `func_1('abcdef')` returns 'ace'
- `func_1('python')` returns 'pto'
- `func_1('data')` returns 'dt'
- `func_1('lambs')` returns 'lms'

No additional edge cases or error handling scenarios contradict the correctness stated in the original assessment, as it's assumed that the input will be valid according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate, and the program is indeed correct.
