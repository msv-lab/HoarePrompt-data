Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it removes characters based on even indices instead of removing characters with odd indices. The annotations claim that the function returns characters at even indices, but the problem description specifically asks to remove characters at odd index values.

The function implementation retains characters at indices 0, 2, 4, etc. which does not align with the expectation of removing characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc. Hence the function does not correctly implement the required functionality stated in the problem description. 

For example, if the input is `'abcdef'`, according to the problem description, the output should be `'ace'` because characters at odd indices ('b', 'd', 'f') should be removed. However, the function incorrectly keeps these characters.

Thus, the implementation fails to meet the specification of the problem, confirming that the program is incorrect.
