Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement, which is to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. 

Here's how it works:
- The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the indices of the string.
- It includes the character in the result if the index is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
- Finally, it joins the characters collected in the list to form the resulting string.

The provided assertions effectively test the function across various cases:
1. For 'abcdef', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'a', 'c', 'e', resulting in 'ace'.
2. For 'python', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'p', 't', 'o', resulting in 'pto'.
3. For 'data', the characters at even indices (0, 2) are 'd', 't', resulting in 'dt'.
4. For 'lambs', the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'l', 'm', 's', resulting in 'lms'.

Since all checks and logic align correctly with the problem description, the code meets the requirements for all tested cases and potentially all other cases. Thus, it is correct.
