Correctness: **True**.

The program `func_1` accurately removes characters from the input string that have odd index values. It constructs a new string by retaining only the characters at even indices. 

Here's how it works for the given examples:

- For `func_1('abcdef')`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'a', 'c', and 'e', resulting in 'ace'.
- For `func_1('python')`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'p', 't', and 'o', resulting in 'pto'.
- For `func_1('data')`, the characters at even indices (0, 2) are 'd' and 't', resulting in 'dt'.
- For `func_1('lambs')`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'l', 'm', and 's', resulting in 'lms'.

The function correctly handles any string input by utilizing a comprehension that iterates over the indices of the string, ensuring it only includes characters with even indices. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code fails according to the problem's requirements.
