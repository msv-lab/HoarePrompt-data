Final: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove characters at odd index values from a given string, as validated by both the functional correctness checks in the assertions and the supporting annotations. 

The original assessment is accurate because the functionality is clearly demonstrated through the provided string examples, illustrating that the characters at even indices are being retained appropriately. The annotations align perfectly with the program logic, indicating that prior to the function call, the input is confirmed to be a string (which meets the problem's input expectations), and the output is indeed a new string formed from characters at even indices of `s`. 

There are no indications of any edge cases or scenarios under the given assumptions where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the overall assessment concludes that the program is correct.
