The provided program is designed to remove characters from a string that are located at odd index positions, retaining only those at even indices. The implementation is done using a list comprehension that filters out the characters based on the indices.

Analyzing the program, we see the following:

1. The function `func_1(s)` is defined to iterate over each index of the string `s`.
2. It checks if the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`) and includes the character at that index in the resulting string.
3. The output hints indicate that the function will correctly return a new string comprising characters at even indices, which is consistent with the assertions provided.

The output hints also note that if the input string is empty, the function will return an empty string, which is indeed the expected behavior as the `range(len(s))` will yield no indices in that case.

Given this thorough examination, the output hints align with the function's implementation and the problem description does not specify any additional edge cases or error handling that could affect the outcome.

Hence, the code works correctly for all potential cases as outlined in the problem description and does not present any missing logic or edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
