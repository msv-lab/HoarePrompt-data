Correctness: **True**.

The provided program successfully removes characters from the input string that have odd index values, returning only the characters that are at even index positions. The implementation uses a generator expression within the join function, iterating over the indices of the string with a step of 2, which targets the even indices directly. 

For instance, if we take the string "abcdef", the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) would be 'a', 'c', and 'e', which results in the output "ace". 

The program handles edge cases, such as:
1. An empty string `""`, which correctly returns an empty string.
2. A string with a single character `"a"`, which correctly returns `"a"`.
3. A string with only even indexed characters, such as `"aceg"`, which returns the same string.

Since all possibilities and edge cases correctly align with the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
