Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting of every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character (index 0). If `s` is empty, the function will return an empty string. The function, however, does not handle any specific cases such as non-string inputs, which could potentially lead to an error if such inputs are provided.**
