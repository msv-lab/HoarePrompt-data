You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the code and see if it correctly calculates the median for all possible provided inputs and edge cases.

**Problem Description**: The function is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

**Given Code**:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

**Analysis**:
1. **Combining Lists**: The function combines the two lists into one using `list1 + list2` and then sorts the combined list. This is correct as the two lists are already sorted.
  
2. **Calculating Median**: It correctly checks if the length of the combined list is even or odd to compute the median:
   - For even length: The median is the average of the two middle numbers.
   - For odd length: The median is the middle number.
   
However, there is a potential issue when considering different sorted lists. The function assumes that both input lists are guaranteed to be sorted. If there is a scenario where the two lists are not sorted, then the result would be incorrect.

**Example of incorrect case**: 
For the lists `list1 = [10, 20]` and `list2 = [5, 15]`, though these are sorted individually, when combined and sorted together:
- Combined list: `[10, 20, 5, 15]` â†’ sorted would give `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.
- The program would return 12.5, which is incorrect since the median of the merged sorted lists should actually be 12.5 if the lists are treated correctly as they are sorted. However it reflects that we expect sorted lists, but it does not enforce that or check that.

Thus, the program could fail if the requirement for the inputs being sorted is not met.

Based on the analysis and the potential issue identified:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer representing the size of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` is equal to the average of the two middle elements, specifically `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is determined based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd: if even, it is the average of the two middle elements; if odd, it is the middle element.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
