To assess the correctness of the program `func_1`, we need to analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the program.

The problem description specifies that the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The program does indeed combine two sorted lists and appropriately calculates the median based on whether the total number of elements in the merged list is even or odd.

Upon reviewing the annotated version, we see that the states before and after the function call confirm that `list1` and `list2` are valid sorted lists and that the function processes these correctly to find the median:

- The annotations illustrate that the input lists are sorted and contain non-negative integers.
- The function merges these two lists and calculates the median appropriately. 
- If the merged list's length is even, the median is computed as the average of the two middle numbers; if odd, it picks the middle number.

However, the original assessment points out some critical shortcomings:
1. The function does not explicitly check whether the input lists are of the same size, which is a requirement from the problem description.
2. It does not handle cases where lists could be empty, even though we are working under the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided.

Despite these points, the program functions correctly under the assumption that inputs are valid. Thus, if we strictly rely on that presumption (per the provided assumption regarding inputs), the program behaves as intended with correctly formatted input.

Given the clarity provided by the annotated version and the fact that the function achieves the goal stated in the problem description (under our assumption of valid inputs), the original assessment's focus on edge cases and incorrect input types may not apply here.

Final: **True**
