Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which states that it must find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

1. **Input Assumptions**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size, along with an integer `n` that indicates the size of each list. It assumes valid input, which, as per the problem description, is guaranteed.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two lists and sorts them using `sorted(list1 + list2)`. This ensures that the resultant `merged_list` contains all elements sorted in ascending order.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - The length of the merged list is correctly evaluated.
   - The program properly checks if the length of the merged list is odd or even.
   - If the length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements: `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`.
   - If the length is odd, it returns the middle element directly.

4. **Returns the Correct Value**: The function returns `median`, which is the correct median value based on the sorted merged list.

The program satisfies all conditions outlined in the problem description, and correctly computes the median for various test cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct as it adheres to the problem requirements.
