To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's review the function `func_1` and determine if it correctly computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

1. The function `func_1` combines the two lists and sorts them, which is an appropriate step for finding the median from two sorted lists.
2. The program correctly handles both even and odd cases of the merged list's length. The median is computed as the average of the two middle numbers when the length is even and as the middle number when the length is odd.
3. The assertions provided at the beginning are valid test cases that follow the problem description and are expected outcomes based on the input.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- If the lists are of different sizes, which violates the problem description stipulating "two sorted lists of the same size", the function should ideally raise an error or handle this scenario explicitly. However, it does not check the sizes of the lists.
  
- If one or both lists are empty, this would also violate the requirement of having lists of the same size with valid elements.

Given these observations, the function does not address the situation where the two lists are not of the same size or are empty. 

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem requirements entirely, as it lacks safeguards against incorrect input.

Correctness: **False**
