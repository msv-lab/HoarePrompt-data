Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately points out that while the function `func_1` correctly computes the median when provided with two sorted lists of the same size, it does not include any checks to ensure that the lists are indeed of the same size, nor does it handle cases where the lists might be empty. The output hints further confirm that the function can lead to incorrect behavior if the input does not meet the expected conditions (i.e., the lists being sorted, non-empty, and of equal size). Since the problem description explicitly requires handling two sorted lists of the same size and the function does not enforce or validate this condition, the function fails to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the final conclusion remains that the function is incorrect.
