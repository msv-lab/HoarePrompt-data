You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's review the function `func_1` and determine if it correctly computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

1. The function `func_1` combines the two lists and sorts them, which is an appropriate step for finding the median from two sorted lists.
2. The program correctly handles both even and odd cases of the merged list's length. The median is computed as the average of the two middle numbers when the length is even and as the middle number when the length is odd.
3. The assertions provided at the beginning are valid test cases that follow the problem description and are expected outcomes based on the input.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- If the lists are of different sizes, which violates the problem description stipulating "two sorted lists of the same size", the function should ideally raise an error or handle this scenario explicitly. However, it does not check the sizes of the lists.
  
- If one or both lists are empty, this would also violate the requirement of having lists of the same size with valid elements.

Given these observations, the function does not address the situation where the two lists are not of the same size or are empty. 

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem requirements entirely, as it lacks safeguards against incorrect input.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of non-negative integers (`list1` and `list2`), as well as a positive integer (`n`) which indicates the size of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list (`merged_list`) and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements in `merged_list` is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements. If the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. Currently, the function does not handle cases where `list1` or `list2` are empty, nor does it validate that the lists contain non-negative integers. These scenarios could lead to wrong outputs or errors. The overall postcondition of the function is that it will return the median value of the merged sorted list derived from the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
