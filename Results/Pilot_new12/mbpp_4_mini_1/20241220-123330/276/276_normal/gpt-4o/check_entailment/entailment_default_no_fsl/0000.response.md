Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where either `list1` or `list2` is empty. For example, if we call `func_1([], [1, 2, 3], 3)`, the program will attempt to calculate the median on an empty list which will lead to incorrect behavior or an error. Additionally, the program does not validate the input to ensure that the lists contain non-negative integers, which contradicts the problem description stating it expects non-negative integers. Since it could fail or produce incorrect outputs for valid input scenarios, the correctness claim is indeed false.
