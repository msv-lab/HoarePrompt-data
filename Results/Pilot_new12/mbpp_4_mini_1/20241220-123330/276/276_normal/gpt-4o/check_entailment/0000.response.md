To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the code and see if it correctly calculates the median for all possible provided inputs and edge cases.

**Problem Description**: The function is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

**Given Code**:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

**Analysis**:
1. **Combining Lists**: The function combines the two lists into one using `list1 + list2` and then sorts the combined list. This is correct as the two lists are already sorted.
  
2. **Calculating Median**: It correctly checks if the length of the combined list is even or odd to compute the median:
   - For even length: The median is the average of the two middle numbers.
   - For odd length: The median is the middle number.
   
However, there is a potential issue when considering different sorted lists. The function assumes that both input lists are guaranteed to be sorted. If there is a scenario where the two lists are not sorted, then the result would be incorrect.

**Example of incorrect case**: 
For the lists `list1 = [10, 20]` and `list2 = [5, 15]`, though these are sorted individually, when combined and sorted together:
- Combined list: `[10, 20, 5, 15]` â†’ sorted would give `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.
- The program would return 12.5, which is incorrect since the median of the merged sorted lists should actually be 12.5 if the lists are treated correctly as they are sorted. However it reflects that we expect sorted lists, but it does not enforce that or check that.

Thus, the program could fail if the requirement for the inputs being sorted is not met.

Based on the analysis and the potential issue identified:

Correctness: **False**.
