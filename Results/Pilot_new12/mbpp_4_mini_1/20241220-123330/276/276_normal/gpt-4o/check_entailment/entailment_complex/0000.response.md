Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description, which is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's the breakdown as to why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) of non-negative integers and a positive integer `n` representing their size. The problem description confirms that inputs will be valid according to this specification.

2. **Merging Lists**: The function merges the two lists into a single sorted list named `merged_list`. This is done using `sorted(list1 + list2)`, effectively combining both lists while preserving order since both input lists are already sorted.

3. **Calculating the Median**:
    - The function calculates the length of `merged_list` and identifies the middle index with the variable `mid`.
    - If the total length of the `merged_list` is even, it correctly computes the median as the average of the two middle elements. This is done by taking elements at positions `mid - 1` and `mid`.
    - If the length is odd, it retrieves the middle element directly, which is handled by the if-else block.

4. **Postconditions**: The function returns the median value correctly for both even and odd cases of total length according to the merging and median-finding methodology established.

The program assumes valid input (non-negative integers in sorted lists), simplifying the verification. It does not explicitly handle empty lists as input, but under problem constraints, we assume that inputs follow the stated rules, hence this is acceptable.

Overall, the function fulfills all requirements of the problem description effectively and systematically. Thus, the conclusion is that it meets the correctness criteria laid out in the request.
