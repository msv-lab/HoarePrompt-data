The function accepts two sorted lists of non-negative integers (`list1` and `list2`), as well as a positive integer (`n`) which indicates the size of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list (`merged_list`) and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements in `merged_list` is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements. If the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. Currently, the function does not handle cases where `list1` or `list2` are empty, nor does it validate that the lists contain non-negative integers. These scenarios could lead to wrong outputs or errors. The overall postcondition of the function is that it will return the median value of the merged sorted list derived from the input lists.
