#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer representing the size of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` is equal to the average of the two middle elements, specifically `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is determined based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd: if even, it is the average of the two middle elements; if odd, it is the middle element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of non-negative integers (`list1` and `list2`), as well as a positive integer (`n`) which indicates the size of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list (`merged_list`) and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements in `merged_list` is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements. If the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. Currently, the function does not handle cases where `list1` or `list2` are empty, nor does it validate that the lists contain non-negative integers. These scenarios could lead to wrong outputs or errors. The overall postcondition of the function is that it will return the median value of the merged sorted list derived from the input lists.
