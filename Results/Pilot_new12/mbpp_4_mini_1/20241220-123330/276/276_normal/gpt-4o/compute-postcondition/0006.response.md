Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` is equal to the average of the two middle elements, specifically `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[n]`.***
