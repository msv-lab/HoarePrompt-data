The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of non-negative integers, and a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of both lists. After executing the function body, it merges the two sorted lists and calculates the median of the merged list. If the length of the merged list is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, it returns the middle element. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of non-negative integers and a positive integer, and return the median of the merged list of these two input lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of non-negative integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`), and returns the median of the merged list. If the length of the merged list is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if odd, it returns the middle element.**
