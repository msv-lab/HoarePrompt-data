`mid` is assigned the value of the length of `merged_list` divided by 2. The variable `merged_list` contains all elements from both `list1` and `list2`, and since both lists are sorted and non-negative, `merged_list` is also sorted and non-negative. The value of `n` represents the size of both lists, thus the length of `merged_list` will be `n + n = 2n`. Therefore, `mid` will be `2n // 2`, which simplifies to `n`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `list2` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is equal to `n`.**
