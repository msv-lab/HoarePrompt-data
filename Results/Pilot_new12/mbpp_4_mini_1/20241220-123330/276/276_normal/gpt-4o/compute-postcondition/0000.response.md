The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are already sorted lists of non-negative integers, their concatenation along with the subsequent sorting will yield a new sorted list known as `merged_list`. The values of `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, and `n` reflects the size of both lists but does not directly affect the operation of merging and sorting.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `list2` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of both lists, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`.**
