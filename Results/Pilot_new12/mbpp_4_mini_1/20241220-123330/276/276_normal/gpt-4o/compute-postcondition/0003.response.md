The code assigns the value of `median` as the average of the two middle elements in `merged_list`. Since `mid` is equal to `n` and the length of `merged_list` is even, `mid - 1` and `mid` are valid indices for accessing the two middle elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `list2` is a sorted list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from both `list1` and `list2`, `mid` is equal to `n`, `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.**
