The variable `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. Given that `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1` and `size` is an odd number, `middle_index` will refer to the middle element of `merged_list`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by the combination of `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `size` is an odd number, `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.**
