Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers. If `size` is even, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]***.
