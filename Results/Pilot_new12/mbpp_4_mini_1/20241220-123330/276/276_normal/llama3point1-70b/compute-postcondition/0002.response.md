Postcondition: ***`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by the combination of `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. The current size of the merged_list is even as determined by the condition that size modulo 2 equals 0.***
