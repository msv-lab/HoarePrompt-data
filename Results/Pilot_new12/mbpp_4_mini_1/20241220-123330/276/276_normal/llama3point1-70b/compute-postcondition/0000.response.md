The merged_list is assigned the value of the sorted combination of list1 and list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and their length is a positive integer. Therefore, merged_list will contain all the elements from both lists sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **list1 is a list of integers, list2 is a list of integers, merged_list is a sorted list of integers formed by the combination of list1 and list2.**
