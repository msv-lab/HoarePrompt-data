The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and they are both of the same size, which is a positive integer represented by `size`. After executing the function body, it returns the median of the merged list. Specifically, if `size` is even, the function returns the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`; if `size` is odd, it returns `merged_list[size - 1]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers of equal length and a positive integer size, and return the median of their merged version based on the parity of the size. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers `list1` and `list2` of the same size, as well as a positive integer `size`, and returns the median of the merged list based on the parity of `size`.**
