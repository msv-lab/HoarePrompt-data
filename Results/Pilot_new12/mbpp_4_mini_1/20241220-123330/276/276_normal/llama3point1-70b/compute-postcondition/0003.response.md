`median` is assigned the value of the average of two elements from `merged_list` at `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`. Since `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1` and the current size of `merged_list` is even, the `middle_index` refers to the last element of the first half of the list, and `middle_index + 1` refers to the first element of the second half. This calculation determines the median of the even-sized `merged_list`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by the combination of `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `median` is equal to `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.**
