Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue lies in the indices used for determining the median when the size is even. 

In the given code:
- The line `middle_index = size - 1` sets the middle index incorrectly for even-sized lists. For an even-sized merged list of length `2n`, the two middle elements would be at indices `n-1` and `n`. Thus, the average should be computed using `merged_list[n-1]` and `merged_list[n]`, rather than `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`, which are effectively `size - 1` and `size`, causing an index out of range error since `merged_list` length is `2 * size` (the total number of elements after combining `list1` and `list2`).

This failure in correctly calculating the median when both lists are even makes the function incorrect as per the problem description. It does not provide the correct median value for all scenarios, particularly for the case when `size` is even.

Thus, while there are assumptions about input validity, the implementation itself fails to meet the requirements of the problem description under those conditions.
