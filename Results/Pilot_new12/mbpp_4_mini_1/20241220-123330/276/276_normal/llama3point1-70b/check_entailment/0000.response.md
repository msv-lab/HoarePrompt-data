To determine the correctness of the provided program that aims to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, let's analyze the code given:

The code provided is:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Middle Index Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `middle_index` is `size - 1`, which is not correct for finding the middle index in a sorted merged list of size `2*size`. The correct midpoints in the merged list should be at `size - 1` and `size` (the two central elements for an even-sized merged list).

2. **Odd Size Handling**:
   - The description implies that both lists are the same size, making the combined list size even, hence there should not be a case to check for an odd size.

### Example Case:
Let's say we have two sorted lists:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and to find the median:
- The middle elements are `2` and `3`, hence the median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, according to the code:
- `middle_index` becomes `2 - 1 = 1`, meaning it tries to access `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]` which are `2` and `3`, and calculates the median correctly as `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 
But if we provide `size = 3`, which is incorrect as lists are not of the same size.

However, if we'd have:
- `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`
- `list2 = [4, 5, 6]`
- `size = 3`, those are not of the same size.

The original logic would fail if invalid input is given.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, any incorrect or invalid pass at the size such as odd or mismatching sizes causes the return to become incorrect leading to overwriting or accessing wrong indices.

Overall, since there exists a case where the program does not work correctly because it relies on the assumption of their equality and performs an operation without validating that condition:

Correctness: **False**.
