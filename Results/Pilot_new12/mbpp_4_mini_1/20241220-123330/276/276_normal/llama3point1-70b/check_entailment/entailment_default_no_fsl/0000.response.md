Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `list1` and `list2` are empty. Although it assumes valid input based on the problem description, there is no validation in the program to ensure that the lists are not empty or that `size` correctly reflects the lengths of the provided lists. If `list1` and `list2` are both empty, the `merged_list` will also be empty, leading to an IndexError when the code attempts to access elements in the merged list to calculate the median. 

Additionally, the logic for determining the middle index assumes that `size` is correctly defined, but since it is derived from the problem constraints, there is no check to ensure that the input matches this constraint. 

Thus, while the code functions correctly for the intended valid cases, it does not handle all scenarios as required in the problem description, making it incorrect.
