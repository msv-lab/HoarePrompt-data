You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify that it accurately calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Merging the Lists**:
   - The program merges `list1` and `list2` using `sorted(list1 + list2)`, which creates a new sorted list that contains all elements from both input lists.

2. **Calculating the Median**:
   - The program uses the variable `middle_index = size - 1`. However, this is incorrect in the context of median calculation. For two sorted lists of size `n`, the middle index for even-sized lists should be `n/2 - 1` for the first middle element and `n/2` for the second middle element.
   - The condition `if size % 2 == 0:` indicates that it is assuming `size` represents the size of both lists combined, which should not be the case if both lists are of the same size.

3. **Issues with Odd and Even Sizes**:
   - If the input lists have an even number of elements (common in the context of having two lists of the same size), using `middle_index = size - 1` does not yield correct indices for accessing the merged list. This could potentially lead to incorrect median calculations or even an index error if the calculation surpasses the valid index range.

### Test Case:

Consider the following two sorted lists as an edge case:
```python
list1 = [1, 3]
list2 = [2, 4]
size = 2  # Since both lists have 2 elements, thus in total size should be 2
```
- The expected calculation should take the sorted merged list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be the average of `2` and `3` which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.
- The current logic would compute `middle_index` as `1`, leading to indices `1` and `2`. Calculation like `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2` would mistakenly try to access `[2 + 3] / 2` which gives `2.5`, so it accidentally still returns the right value. 
- However, if lists were of larger size or if there was an assumption of size being simply combined without proper handling, similar issues may arise leading to an indefinite malfunction.

### Conclusion:
While in this specific case, the output matches the expected median due to the composition of the data, the logic does not hold universally for all cases particularly when lists are of varied length or content.

Given these findings, the solution fundamentally fails to handle the task of finding the median reliably and is prone to error.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers. If `size` is even, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]` if `size` is even, or `merged_list[size - 1]` if `size` is odd.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
