Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Specifically, the calculation of the middle index and how it handles the indices in the `merged_list` is incorrect.

1. **Index Error**: The middle index is calculated as `size - 1`, which leads to incorrect indexing when checking the median. In a sorted list of size `2 * size` (the combined size of both lists), the correct middle index for even-sized lists should be `size - 1` when averaging the two middle values, which are actually located at positions `size - 1` and `size` in the `merged_list`. Therefore, if the lists are of size `n`, the median should be determined by `(merged_list[n-1] + merged_list[n]) / 2` for even-sized lists.

2. **Odd Size Handling**: While the function does check if the size is even or odd, since the problem description specifies that the input lists will always be of the same size, it inherently implies both lists are of the same size. With this confirmation, it is moot to check for odd sizes, as the two lists will always sum to an even-length merged list when combined.

Overall, because of these issues with indexing, the function will not properly return the correct median for the two sorted lists, thus it does not fulfill the requirements of the given problem description.
