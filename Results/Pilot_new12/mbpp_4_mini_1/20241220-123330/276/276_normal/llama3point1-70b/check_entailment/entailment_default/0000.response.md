Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly merges the two sorted lists and calculates the median based on the provided size. However, there is a critical issue with how the median is computed. The variable `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which is incorrect for both even and odd sizes when trying to access middle elements (especially when `size` is even). For an even length, the correct middle indices should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, and for odd length, it should simply be `size // 2`. Additionally, the `if size % 2 == 0:` condition is intended for even sizes but would not work properly when `size` is given directly as the length of the lists. Consequently, the calculation of the median can lead to an inaccurate result when `size` is even. For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, then when merging and calculating the median, the function would erroneously try to access indices that do not correspond to the correct middle values of the merged list. Therefore, the function does not comply with the problem description for all potential cases.
