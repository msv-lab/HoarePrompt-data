You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers. If `size` is even, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `merged_list` is a sorted list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]` if `size` is even, or `merged_list[size - 1]` if `size` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes in two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same size, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list. It then calculates and returns the median of this merged list depending on whether the size is even or odd. If `size` is even, the median is returned as the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted merged list. The current implementation does not handle the case where `list1` and `list2` are empty or contain invalid data types (not integers), nor does it validate that `size` accurately reflects the lengths of the lists, which could lead to potential errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
