To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify that it accurately calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Merging the Lists**:
   - The program merges `list1` and `list2` using `sorted(list1 + list2)`, which creates a new sorted list that contains all elements from both input lists.

2. **Calculating the Median**:
   - The program uses the variable `middle_index = size - 1`. However, this is incorrect in the context of median calculation. For two sorted lists of size `n`, the middle index for even-sized lists should be `n/2 - 1` for the first middle element and `n/2` for the second middle element.
   - The condition `if size % 2 == 0:` indicates that it is assuming `size` represents the size of both lists combined, which should not be the case if both lists are of the same size.

3. **Issues with Odd and Even Sizes**:
   - If the input lists have an even number of elements (common in the context of having two lists of the same size), using `middle_index = size - 1` does not yield correct indices for accessing the merged list. This could potentially lead to incorrect median calculations or even an index error if the calculation surpasses the valid index range.

### Test Case:

Consider the following two sorted lists as an edge case:
```python
list1 = [1, 3]
list2 = [2, 4]
size = 2  # Since both lists have 2 elements, thus in total size should be 2
```
- The expected calculation should take the sorted merged list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be the average of `2` and `3` which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.
- The current logic would compute `middle_index` as `1`, leading to indices `1` and `2`. Calculation like `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2` would mistakenly try to access `[2 + 3] / 2` which gives `2.5`, so it accidentally still returns the right value. 
- However, if lists were of larger size or if there was an assumption of size being simply combined without proper handling, similar issues may arise leading to an indefinite malfunction.

### Conclusion:
While in this specific case, the output matches the expected median due to the composition of the data, the logic does not hold universally for all cases particularly when lists are of varied length or content.

Given these findings, the solution fundamentally fails to handle the task of finding the median reliably and is prone to error.

Correctness: **False**
