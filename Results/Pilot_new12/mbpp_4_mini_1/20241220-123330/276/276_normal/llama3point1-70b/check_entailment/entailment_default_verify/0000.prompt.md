You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program that aims to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, let's analyze the code given:

The code provided is:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Middle Index Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `middle_index` is `size - 1`, which is not correct for finding the middle index in a sorted merged list of size `2*size`. The correct midpoints in the merged list should be at `size - 1` and `size` (the two central elements for an even-sized merged list).

2. **Odd Size Handling**:
   - The description implies that both lists are the same size, making the combined list size even, hence there should not be a case to check for an odd size.

### Example Case:
Let's say we have two sorted lists:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and to find the median:
- The middle elements are `2` and `3`, hence the median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, according to the code:
- `middle_index` becomes `2 - 1 = 1`, meaning it tries to access `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]` which are `2` and `3`, and calculates the median correctly as `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 
But if we provide `size = 3`, which is incorrect as lists are not of the same size.

However, if we'd have:
- `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`
- `list2 = [4, 5, 6]`
- `size = 3`, those are not of the same size.

The original logic would fail if invalid input is given.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, any incorrect or invalid pass at the size such as odd or mismatching sizes causes the return to become incorrect leading to overwriting or accessing wrong indices.

Overall, since there exists a case where the program does not work correctly because it relies on the assumption of their equality and performs an operation without validating that condition:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes in two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same size, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list. It then calculates and returns the median of this merged list depending on whether the size is even or odd. If `size` is even, the median is returned as the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted merged list. The current implementation does not handle the case where `list1` and `list2` are empty or contain invalid data types (not integers), nor does it validate that `size` accurately reflects the lengths of the lists, which could lead to potential errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
