The function `func_1` takes in two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same size, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges these two lists into one sorted list. It then calculates and returns the median of this merged list depending on whether the size is even or odd. If `size` is even, the median is returned as the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted merged list. The current implementation does not handle the case where `list1` and `list2` are empty or contain invalid data types (not integers), nor does it validate that `size` accurately reflects the lengths of the lists, which could lead to potential errors.
