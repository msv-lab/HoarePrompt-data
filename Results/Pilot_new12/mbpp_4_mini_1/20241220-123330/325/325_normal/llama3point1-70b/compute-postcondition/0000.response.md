The code initializes a list `thirty_days_months` that contains the months which have 30 days. The initial state specifies that `month` is an integer value between 1 and 12, inclusive. The value of `month` is not affected by the assignment of the list as the execution of the code only focuses on creating a new variable.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `month` remains an integer between 1 and 12, and there is now a new variable `thirty_days_months` which holds a specific list of the months that have 30 days.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; `thirty_days_months` is [4, 6, 9, 11]**
