Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which must be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the given month corresponds to any of the months with thirty days (April, June, September, and November). The function returns `True` if the input `month` is one of these months and returns `False` for all other months (including the months with 31 days and February). There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid input (e.g., months outside the range of 1 to 12) within the code, which means the function assumes the input will always meet the stated precondition.**
