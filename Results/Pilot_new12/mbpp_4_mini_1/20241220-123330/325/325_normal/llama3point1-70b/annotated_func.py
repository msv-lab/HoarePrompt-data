#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11] and False otherwise, where month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which must be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the given month corresponds to any of the months with thirty days (April, June, September, and November). The function returns `True` if the input `month` is one of these months and returns `False` for all other months (including the months with 31 days and February). There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid input (e.g., months outside the range of 1 to 12) within the code, which means the function assumes the input will always meet the stated precondition.
