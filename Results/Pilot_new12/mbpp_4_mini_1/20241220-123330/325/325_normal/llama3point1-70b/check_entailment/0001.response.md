Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description because it fails to account for some potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the month number is present in the list of months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November). However, it does not address the following issues:

1. It does not return False for months that do not have 30 days. For instance, January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) all have 31 days, and February (2) has 28 or 29 days depending on the year. The program only returns True for months in the list.

2. Additionally, it does not handle invalid month numbers outside the range of 1 to 12. If the function is given an invalid month number like 0 or 13, it would return False since those numbers are not in the list, which does not correctly reflect the problem description requirements.

Therefore, since the program fails to return correct results for all potential inputs, it is incorrect.
