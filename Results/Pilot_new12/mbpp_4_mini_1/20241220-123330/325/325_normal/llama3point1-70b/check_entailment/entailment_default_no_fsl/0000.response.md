Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, while the function checks if the month corresponds to one with 30 days, it lacks error handling for months that are outside the valid range of 1 to 12. For instance, if an invalid input like 0 or 13 is provided, the function would return `False` incorrectly, because it won't account for the fact that these inputs are not valid months. Hence, the program does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements for every possible input case.
