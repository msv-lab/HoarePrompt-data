Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days or not. It defines a list `thirty_days_months` that includes the month numbers for April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are the only months with 30 days.

The function `func_1(month)` returns `True` if the input `month` is in the list `thirty_days_months`, indicating that it has 30 days, and returns `False` otherwise, which includes all other months, including February (28 or 29 days), months with 31 days, and any invalid month numbers. The function operates under the assumption that the input month will always be a valid integer between 1 and 12.

Since the requirements in the problem description are met and all specified cases are correctly handled by the function, the program is correct.
