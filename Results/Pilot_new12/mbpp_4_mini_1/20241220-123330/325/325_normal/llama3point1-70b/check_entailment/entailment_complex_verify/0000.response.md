Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description to determine if a given month number (1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. The annotations confirm that the function checks the input month against a defined list of months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and returns `True` for those months and `False` otherwise. 

The function accounts for all valid inputs (1 through 12) and behaves as expected according to both the problem description and the annotate version. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate. The assumptions made regarding input validity (that it will always be within the specified range) also support the conclusion of correctness.
