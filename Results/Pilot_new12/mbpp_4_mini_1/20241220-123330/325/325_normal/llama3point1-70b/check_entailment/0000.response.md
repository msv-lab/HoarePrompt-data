Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the given month number (from 1 to 12) is one of the months that contains 30 days (April, June, September, November). It utilizes a list to hold these month numbers and checks if the input month is in that list. 

All valid inputs (1 through 12) return the expected results:
- For months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `True`.
- For all other months (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function returns `False`. 

Therefore, it operates correctly for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
