You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description because it fails to account for some potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the month number is present in the list of months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November). However, it does not address the following issues:

1. It does not return False for months that do not have 30 days. For instance, January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) all have 31 days, and February (2) has 28 or 29 days depending on the year. The program only returns True for months in the list.

2. Additionally, it does not handle invalid month numbers outside the range of 1 to 12. If the function is given an invalid month number like 0 or 13, it would return False since those numbers are not in the list, which does not correctly reflect the problem description requirements.

Therefore, since the program fails to return correct results for all potential inputs, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which must be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the given month corresponds to any of the months with thirty days (April, June, September, and November). The function returns `True` if the input `month` is one of these months and returns `False` for all other months (including the months with 31 days and February). There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid input (e.g., months outside the range of 1 to 12) within the code, which means the function assumes the input will always meet the stated precondition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
