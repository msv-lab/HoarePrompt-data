Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided function checks whether the input month corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) by verifying if the month number is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. However, the function does not handle invalid inputs, such as numbers outside the range of 1 to 12. For example, if the input 0 or 13 is provided, the function will still return `False`, which is misleading because those inputs do not correspond to any month. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not satisfy the requirement stated in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
