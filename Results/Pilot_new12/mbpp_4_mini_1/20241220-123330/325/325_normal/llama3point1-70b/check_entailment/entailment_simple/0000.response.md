Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that checks whether a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Range:** The function `func_1` is stated to accept an integer `month` between 1 and 12, which corresponds to the months of the year.
   
2. **30 Days Check:** The code defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the integers `[4, 6, 9, 11]`, which represent April, June, September, and November â€” all of which indeed have 30 days.

3. **Logic Implementation:** The expression `month in thirty_days_months` checks if the input `month` is present in the list of months that have 30 days. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Completeness:** Since the function handles all valid month inputs (1 to 12) and correctly identifies which of these months have 30 days based on the specified logic, it meets the requirements described in the problem.

Overall, the implementation is straightforward and directly aligned with the task, thus confirming that the program is correct.
