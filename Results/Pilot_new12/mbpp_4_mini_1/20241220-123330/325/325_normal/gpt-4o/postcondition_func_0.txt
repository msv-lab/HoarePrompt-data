The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the provided `month` is one of the months with 30 days, specifically April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if `month` is one of these months; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function properly handles valid inputs within the specified range but does not account for invalid inputs (such as integers outside the range of 1-12) and does not raise any errors if such inputs are provided.
