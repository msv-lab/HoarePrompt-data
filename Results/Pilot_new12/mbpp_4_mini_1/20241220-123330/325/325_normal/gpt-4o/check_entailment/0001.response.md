Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether the given month number contains 30 days. Based on the requirements:

- Months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
- The expected return should be `True` for these months, and `False` for the others.

The function correctly identifies months with 30 days using a set. However, the assertions in the provided code do not cover all possible month inputs:

1. **Assertion for February (2)**: The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is incorrect since February has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, and thus should return `False` for the context of having 30 days.
  
2. **Assertions for Months with 31 Days**: There are no assertions checking for months like January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) that all have 31 days. Hence, these cases are also unaccounted for.

Since there is no handling for February correctly and also no checks for 31-day months, the function does not meet the requirement fully, leading to the conclusion that the function is incorrect.
