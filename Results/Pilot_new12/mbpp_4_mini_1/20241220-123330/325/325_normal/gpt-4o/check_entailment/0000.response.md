To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and how it handles input months.

The function is described to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1` correctly defines a set of months with 30 days: `{4, 6, 9, 11}`.
2. The function checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

Now considering the assertions provided:
- `assert func_1(6) == True` (June has 30 days - correct)
- `assert func_1(2) == False` (February does not have 30 days - correct)
- `assert func_1(12) == False` (December does not have 30 days - correct)

However, we need to consider edge cases and other months:
- For inputs `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `10`, and `12`, the function should return `False` since these months either have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October) or 28/29 days (February).
- The provided program does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., month numbers less than 1 or greater than 12), which can lead to erroneous outputs. If we check `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`, the function would incorrectly return `False`.

Thus, the program fails to account for the rule that the input must be a valid month (ranged between 1 and 12).

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases since it can produce unintended results for inputs outside the range of valid months. For example, `func_1(0)` should ideally raise an error or return a specific invalid output, but it would currently return `False`, which is not accurate behavior according to the problem description.
