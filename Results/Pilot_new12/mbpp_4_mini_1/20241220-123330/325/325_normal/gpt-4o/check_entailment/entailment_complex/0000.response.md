The provided Python program aims to determine if a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The function `func_1` utilizes a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function checks if the input month is present in this set, returning `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The problem states that the function needs to check if a month number corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. The function correctly identifies April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11) as the months with 30 days.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The function is only built to handle valid cases within the range of 1 to 12, as specified in the annotations. This means that under the assumption that input will always be valid, the function will never receive values outside this range which could lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided as part of the program are also aligned with the expected behavior:
   - `func_1(6)` returns `True` since June has 30 days.
   - `func_1(2)` returns `False` since February typically has either 28 or 29 days and does not have 30.
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False` since December has 31 days.

Based on these points, the program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description by correctly identifying months with 30 days.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description and can be considered valid.

Correctness: **True**
