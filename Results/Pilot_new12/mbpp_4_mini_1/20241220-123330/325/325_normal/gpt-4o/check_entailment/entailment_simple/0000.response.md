The provided program is intended to determine whether a given month (represented as a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. According to the problem description, the months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

### Analysis of the Program:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the input month is in a set of months that have 30 days (`months_with_30_days` which includes 4, 6, 9, and 11).
2. It returns `True` if the month is one of those (30 days) and `False` otherwise.
3. The assertions provided check the correctness of the function:
   - `assert func_1(6) == True` is correct since June has 30 days.
   - `assert func_1(2) == False` is correct since February does not have 30 days.
   - `assert func_1(12) == False` is correct since December does not have 30 days.

However, the crucial aspect that the function misses relates directly to the problem statement, which asks whether the month contains 30 days or not. Specifically, the problem description implies that for months that do not have 30 days, the function should return `False`. 

**Missing Cases:**
- The months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) are not included in the `months_with_30_days` set. Thus, they are implicitly assumed to have 31 days (or February which typically has 28 or 29 days), leading to a situation where the function might not return an expected result if misinterpreted.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies the months that have 30 days, but it does so using an incomplete approach by not clarifying that only April, June, September, and November have 30 days while all other months (that are not mentioned) should automatically fall to a default of not having 30 days. In essence, the program meets the requirement for the assertion cases given but does not fully adhere to the broader problem context.

Thus, the Correctness is evaluated as:

Correctness: **False**
