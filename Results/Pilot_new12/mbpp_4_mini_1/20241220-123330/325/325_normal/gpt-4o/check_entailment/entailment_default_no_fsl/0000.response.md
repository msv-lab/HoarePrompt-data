Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check whether the given month number contains 30 days. It correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), but it fails to handle invalid inputs. 

The output hints mention that the function accepts integers expected to be between 1 and 12, but it does not handle cases where the input is outside this range, such as 0 or 13. For example:

- If `func_1(0)` is called, it will return `False`, but the problem description does not account for this invalid month number.
- If `func_1(13)` is called, it will also return `False`, which is incorrect as 13 is not a valid month.

Thus, since the function does not correctly validate the input and may produce incorrect results for invalid inputs, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.
