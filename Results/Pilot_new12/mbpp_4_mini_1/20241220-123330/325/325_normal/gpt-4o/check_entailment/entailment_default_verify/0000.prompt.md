You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and how it handles input months.

The function is described to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1` correctly defines a set of months with 30 days: `{4, 6, 9, 11}`.
2. The function checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

Now considering the assertions provided:
- `assert func_1(6) == True` (June has 30 days - correct)
- `assert func_1(2) == False` (February does not have 30 days - correct)
- `assert func_1(12) == False` (December does not have 30 days - correct)

However, we need to consider edge cases and other months:
- For inputs `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `10`, and `12`, the function should return `False` since these months either have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October) or 28/29 days (February).
- The provided program does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., month numbers less than 1 or greater than 12), which can lead to erroneous outputs. If we check `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`, the function would incorrectly return `False`.

Thus, the program fails to account for the rule that the input must be a valid month (ranged between 1 and 12).

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases since it can produce unintended results for inputs outside the range of valid months. For example, `func_1(0)` should ideally raise an error or return a specific invalid output, but it would currently return `False`, which is not accurate behavior according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the provided `month` is one of the months with 30 days, specifically April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if `month` is one of these months; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function properly handles valid inputs within the specified range but does not account for invalid inputs (such as integers outside the range of 1-12) and does not raise any errors if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
