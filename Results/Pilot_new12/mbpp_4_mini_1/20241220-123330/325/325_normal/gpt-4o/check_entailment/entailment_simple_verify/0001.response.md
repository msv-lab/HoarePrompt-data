The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is incorrect. This assessment is supported by the facts in the problem description and annotations provided. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Problem Statement Understanding**: The task is to determine if a month (represented as a number from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function should return `True` for these months and `False` for others.

2. **Function Logic**: The function defines a set `months_with_30_days` that includes {4, 6, 9, 11}. It checks if the input month is in this set and returns the corresponding Boolean value.

3. **Assessment of Assertions**:
   - The assertion `assert func_1(6) == True` is accurate since June (6) has 30 days.
   - The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is incorrect in the context of the problem description; while February (2) indeed does not have 30 days, it also does not fulfill the requirement of returning a specific behavior for months with fewer than 30 days, which should involve checking months correctly. Thus, the function should return `False`, so this assertion is expected to hold.
   - The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is incorrect because December (12) has 31 days, and therefore this assertion should return `True`, causing a mismatch for the expected behavior.

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The function does not have assertions or checks for months which have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, and October). Therefore, it provides incorrect conclusions on months other than 30-day months.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Based on the provided annotations and reasoning:
   - While the implementation correctly identifies the months with 30 days, the assertions provide misleading expectations that do not cover all cases appropriately, which affects the outcome of the function.

Conclusively, the function fails to fully meet the expectations of the problem description. Thus, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is accurate.

Final: **False**
