You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether the given month number contains 30 days. Based on the requirements:

- Months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
- The expected return should be `True` for these months, and `False` for the others.

The function correctly identifies months with 30 days using a set. However, the assertions in the provided code do not cover all possible month inputs:

1. **Assertion for February (2)**: The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is incorrect since February has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, and thus should return `False` for the context of having 30 days.
  
2. **Assertions for Months with 31 Days**: There are no assertions checking for months like January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) that all have 31 days. Hence, these cases are also unaccounted for.

Since there is no handling for February correctly and also no checks for 31-day months, the function does not meet the requirement fully, leading to the conclusion that the function is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if the provided `month` is one of the months with 30 days, specifically April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if `month` is one of these months; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function properly handles valid inputs within the specified range but does not account for invalid inputs (such as integers outside the range of 1-12) and does not raise any errors if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
