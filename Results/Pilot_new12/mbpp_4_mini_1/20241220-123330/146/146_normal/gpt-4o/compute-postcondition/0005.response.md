The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. Since `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` and has a current length greater than 0, `max_list` will now hold the same reference as `lst`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the current length of `lst` is greater than 0.**
