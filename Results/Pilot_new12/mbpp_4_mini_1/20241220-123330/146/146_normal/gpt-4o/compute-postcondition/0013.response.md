The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The variable `lst` is expected to be one of the sublists from `list_of_lists`, which should contain at least one more sublist. Since `max_len` is specified as a positive integer and `max_list` is assigned a sublist, the change directly affects `max_list`, while the others remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_len` is a positive integer, `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist.**
