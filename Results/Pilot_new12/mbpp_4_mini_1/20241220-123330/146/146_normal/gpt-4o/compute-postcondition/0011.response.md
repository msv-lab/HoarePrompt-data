According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If there are more than 2 sublists in the `list_of_lists`, the loop can continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists. Therefore, the loop is currently at the first iteration, processing the first sublist. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_len` can remain 0 (if `lst` in the next iteration is not longer than 0), and `max_list` can still be an empty list, but `lst` must be the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

If there are 2 sublists total, after one loop iteration it has processed 1 sublist, so for the loop to run again, we assume there is at least 1 more sublist remaining in `list_of_lists` to process.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist**
