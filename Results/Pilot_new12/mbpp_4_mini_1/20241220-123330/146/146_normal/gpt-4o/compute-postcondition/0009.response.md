`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. This means that `max_list` now holds the same reference as `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged: `max_len` still equals the length of `lst`, `max_list` now equals `lst`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and `lst` is still the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
