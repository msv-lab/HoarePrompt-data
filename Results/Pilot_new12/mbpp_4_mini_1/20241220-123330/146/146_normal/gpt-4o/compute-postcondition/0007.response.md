According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop needs to iterate through the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

For the loop to execute again, `lst` must be updated to the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, there is at least one more to iterate through.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
- `max_len` may or may not change based on the new `lst`, but it starts from 0.
- `max_list` may or may not change based on the new `lst`.
- `lst` must be updated to the next sublist.
- The condition for `list_of_lists` must be that it still contains at least 2 sublists to ensure another iteration is possible.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
