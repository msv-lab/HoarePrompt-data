In this scenario, `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, where `lst` is a sublist from `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `len(lst)` will result in a positive integer (the length of that sublist). 

The value of `max_len` changes to represent the length of an existing sublist, but without explicit information about what `lst` is, we can only state that it will be a positive integer. The other variable `max_list` and the structure of `list_of_lists` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is a positive integer (length of a sublist from `list_of_lists`), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist.**
