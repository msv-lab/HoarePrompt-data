According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. Given that `max_len` is initialized to 0 and `max_list` is an empty list, these states do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, and the loop will start with `lst` being the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
