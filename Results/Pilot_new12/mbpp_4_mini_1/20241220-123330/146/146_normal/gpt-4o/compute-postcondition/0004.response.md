The code assigns `max_len` the value of the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` and its current length is greater than 0, `max_len` will be updated to a positive integer equal to `len(lst)`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the current length of `lst` is greater than 0.**
