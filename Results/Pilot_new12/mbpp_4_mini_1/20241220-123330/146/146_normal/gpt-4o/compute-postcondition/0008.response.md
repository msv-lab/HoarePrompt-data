`max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, which means that `max_len` now holds the length of the second sublist `lst` from `list_of_lists`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `max_list` is still an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists with `lst` being the second sublist.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
