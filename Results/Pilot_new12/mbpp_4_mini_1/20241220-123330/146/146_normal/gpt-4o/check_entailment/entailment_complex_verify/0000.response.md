Based on the provided problem description and the analysis of both the original assessment and the annotated code, the following points can be summarized:

1. **Program Functionality**: The `func_1` function is designed to find the longest sublist within a list of lists and return both the length of this longest sublist and the sublist itself. The function iteratively compares lengths of the sublists and updates its maximum length and corresponding sublist accordingly.

2. **Handling of Input**: As per the original assessment, there is an acknowledgement of cases where the input might be empty or where multiple sublists share the same maximum length. However, it was pointed out that if the input `list_of_lists` is empty, the function would return `(0, [])`, which could be seen as an unexpected behavior but is not directly specified as a failure of the program given the assumption of valid inputs.

3. **Assessment of Edge Cases**:
   - The function does handle potential edge cases, such as dealing with lists of varying lengths, correctly identifying the longest list. 
   - It returns only the first maximal list when ties occur in length, which might limit its usefulness depending on the definitions provided by the problem description. 

4. **Assumptions about Input**: The annotations and the reasoning clarify that if the input of the program is expected to be valid (i.e., it won't be empty or contain invalid types), then the current implementation behaves as intended. 

Given these points and understanding that the concerns about empty inputs or ties are based on interpretations of the problem requirements that are not explicitly stated, the function effectively meets the task of returning the longest list and its length, considering the valid input condition.

**Conclusion**: The original assessment is correct in stating that while the program might not handle every conceivable scenario optimally (like empty lists or maximum length ties), within the bounds provided by the assumptions of the problem description, the program's primary function is achieved.

Final: **True**
