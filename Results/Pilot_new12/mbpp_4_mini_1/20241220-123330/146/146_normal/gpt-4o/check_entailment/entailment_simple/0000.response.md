Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem, the function must return the "list of maximum length in a list of lists." However, the annotated program returns a tuple consisting of both the maximum length and the longest sublist. 

The expected output based on the problem description is:
- A list (the longest sublist) rather than a tuple that also includes the length.

The outputs should be only the longest sublist, hence the function signature and return statement need to be adjusted to fulfill the requirement of delivering just the sublist of maximum length. 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the specifications given in the problem description.
