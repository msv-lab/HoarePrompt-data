Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` fails to handle several potential edge cases as indicated by the output hints. Specifically, it does not address situations such as:

1. An empty input list (`[]`): In this case, the function will return `0` and an empty list, which might not be a valid output since the problem description states that the input will be a non-empty list of lists.
2. Handling of elements that are not lists: If `list_of_lists` includes non-list elements, the function assumes that all elements are lists without any validation. However, this can lead to unexpected results or errors if the input contains incompatible types.
3. If all sublists are empty (e.g., `[[ ]]`), the function would again return `0` and an empty list, which might not adhere to assumptions that at least one sublist should contain elements.

Due to these reasons, the function does not correctly meet the requirements for every potential case presented in the problem description.
