To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail.

The function is supposed to find the list of maximum length from a list of lists and return a tuple containing two items:
1. The length of the longest list.
2. The longest list itself.

The tests provided in the assertions suggest that the function is expected to behave as follows:
- From the input `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the longest list is `[13, 15, 17]` which has a length of 3.
- For `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, the longest list is `[10, 12, 14, 15]`, length 4.
- For `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, the longest list is `[15, 20, 25]`, length 3.

Now let's consider potential edge cases or scenarios to ensure the function works as expected:

1. **Empty input**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function should ideally return `(0, [])` since there are no lists to consider.
   
2. **Multiple lists of same maximum length**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, the function only returns the first one it encounters. For example, with input `[[1, 2], [3], [4, 5]]`, the longest lists are both `[1, 2]` and `[4, 5]` (with length 2), but the function would return `(2, [1, 2])`. While it doesn't violate the specification, it's worth noting.

3. **Overall empty lists**: If the input contains empty lists, such as `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`, it should return `(2, [1, 2])` since `[1, 2]` is the longest non-empty list. 

After considering these cases, we can conclude that the only edge case this implementation does not handle is when the input is an empty list. The function does not account for this situation and would raise an `IndexError` because `max_list` would remain uninitialized when trying to return its value.

So, considering the failure to handle an empty list input correctly:

Correctness: **False**
