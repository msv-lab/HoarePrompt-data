The provided program `func_1` is designed to find the longest sublist within a list of lists and return its length along with the sublist itself. 

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, the program checks the length of each sublist, updating the maximum length and longest sublist accordingly. However, there are several shortcomings highlighted in the output hints:

1. **Empty Input Case**: The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. If provided an empty list as input, the program would return `(0, [])`, which might not be appropriate based on the expectation for non-empty lists.

2. **Sublists Handling**: If `list_of_lists` contains empty sublists, these could skew the output. The current implementation does not account for this and will simply return the first non-empty sublist's length and content, potentially overlooking entirely empty input.

3. **Behavior with Multiple Maximums**: If there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length, the function is expected to return the last longest sublist encountered. While this behavior is stated in the output hints, it may not always align with user expectations when analyzing the output.

The hints confirm that if there are empty sublists, they can lead to a situation where `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list, which might not meet the requirements for correct outputs.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
