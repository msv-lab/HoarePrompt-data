To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, I'll analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem description states that the function should find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The goal is to return a tuple with the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

Let's evaluate the program:

1. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`.
   - If so, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

Now, we will look for potential edge cases or scenarios where this logic may fail:

### Potential Case 1: Empty Input
If the input `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will still return `(0, [])`, which indicates that there is no list present. This behavior may be correct as per the problem description but may depend on how one interprets "maximum length".

### Potential Case 2: Multiple Lists with the Same Maximum Length
If there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, the function only returns the first one it encounters. For example:
```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```
The method will return `(2, [1, 2])`, which is the first maximum-length list. Depending on the exact requirements of the problem (not stated explicitly in the description), this could also be considered a limitation.

### Potential Case 3: Nested Lists with Different Lengths
The function correctly identifies the longest length regardless of the values in the lists. However, if lists contain nested structures or similar lengths, the behavior should still be further validated.

Given the assertions provided:
- The function returns correct results for the specific examples provided.
- However, the assumptions and effective handling for empty lists and lists with ties in length might not fully satisfy every interpretation of the problem requirement.

### Conclusion
Because of the ambiguity in how to handle empty input and ties, technically, the implementation might not completely adhere to a strict interpretation of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for empty input cases or explicitly state how to handle ties in lengths between multiple lists. If the input is `[]`, the behavior is likely not as expected based on a common understanding of the task.
