The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a non-empty list containing sublists. It identifies and returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is the longest sublist itself. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the last one encountered in the iteration is returned. The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, it assumes that all elements in `list_of_lists` are indeed lists, which may not always be the case, and does not account for sublists being empty. Thus, if `list_of_lists` contains only empty sublists, `max_len` will be 0 and `max_list` will be an empty list.
