#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can hold any number of elements.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `list_of_lists` is a non-empty list containing multiple sublists.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists, and max_list, which is the longest sublist in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a non-empty list containing sublists. It identifies and returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is the longest sublist itself. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the last one encountered in the iteration is returned. The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, it assumes that all elements in `list_of_lists` are indeed lists, which may not always be the case, and does not account for sublists being empty. Thus, if `list_of_lists` contains only empty sublists, `max_len` will be 0 and `max_list` will be an empty list.
