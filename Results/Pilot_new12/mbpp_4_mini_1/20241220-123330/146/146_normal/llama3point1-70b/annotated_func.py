#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying length.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` which is `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`, which contains sublists of that maximum length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns a tuple containing two elements: the maximum length of the sublists within that list and the first sublist found that has this maximum length. Notably, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise an error due to attempting to compute `max_len` and indexing `max_sublists`, which would not be valid. Additionally, if there are no sublists that share the maximum length (though logically impossible with the structure of the code), the result of taking the first element of `max_sublists` would also raise an error if it were empty. Thus, the function lacks error handling for these edge cases.
