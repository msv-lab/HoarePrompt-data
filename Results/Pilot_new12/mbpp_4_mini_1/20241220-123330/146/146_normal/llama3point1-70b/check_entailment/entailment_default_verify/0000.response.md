Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to meet the primary requirement of the problem description: identifying all lists of maximum length from the input list of lists. Instead, the program only returns the first sublist of maximum length along with its length. This behavior does not fulfill the requirement, particularly in cases where there are multiple lists sharing the maximum length. 

Additionally, the program will raise a `ValueError` when invoked with an empty list of lists, which is another significant flaw as per the problem statement. The output hints corroborate this by stating that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or when there are multiple maximum-length lists. Therefore, the functionality as implemented does not align with what was required, confirming that the program is, indeed, incorrect.
