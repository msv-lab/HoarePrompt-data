Based on the provided problem description, the goal of the function `func_1` is to find the list(s) with maximum length from a list of lists. The original assessment concludes that the function is incorrect because it only returns the first sublist of maximum length, failing to account for multiple sublists that may also have this maximum length.

Reviewing the annotated version, it outlines that the function calculates the maximum length and constructs a list of all sublists that match this maximum length. However, it ultimately only returns the first sublist from this list, which means it does not fulfill the requirement of providing all sublists of maximum length as stated in the problem description.

While the assumption that the input will always be valid (non-empty and structured correctly) reduces concerns about error handling for empty lists, it does not change the fundamental requirement of returning all maximum-length sublists rather than just one. The annotation clarifies that the program also lacks error handling for edge cases, but even putting that aside, the function's behavior does not align with the expected output per the problem description.

Therefore, the assessment that the program is incorrect remains valid. 

Final: **False**
