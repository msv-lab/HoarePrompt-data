Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `list_of_lists` is empty. When `list_of_lists` is empty, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot compute the maximum of an empty sequence. Additionally, if there are no sublists in the list, attempting to access `max_sublists[0]` would also raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function fails to handle these edge cases as required by the problem description, making it incorrect.
