Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, but instead, it only returns the first sublist with that length. The annotated version clarifies how `max_len` is computed and how a sublist is chosen from `max_sublists`, confirming that the function fails to handle the requirement to return all sublists of maximum length. Therefore, the conclusion that the program's correctness is **False** remains valid.
