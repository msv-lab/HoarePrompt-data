Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Hereâ€™s why it meets the specification:

1. **Finding Maximum Length**: The function computes the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists` using a generator expression with `max()`. This accurately captures the longest sublist length.

2. **Collecting Sublists of Maximum Length**: It correctly gathers all sublists that share this maximum length in the list `max_sublists`.

3. **Returning Required Values**: The function returns a tuple consisting of two elements:
   - `max_len`: the computed maximum length, which directly corresponds to the request for the maximum length of the sublists.
   - `max_sublists[0]`: the first sublist found with this maximum length is returned as part of the output, fulfilling the requirement to retrieve a sublist of maximum length.

The overall behavior aligns with the problem description, specifically targeting both the identification of the maximum length and referencing a sublist corresponding with that length. While the function does not include handling for empty input lists, the problem assumes that valid input is provided, so this is not deemed a flaw in this context.

Therefore, the function's approach and methods are consistent with the stated problem, confirming its correctness.
