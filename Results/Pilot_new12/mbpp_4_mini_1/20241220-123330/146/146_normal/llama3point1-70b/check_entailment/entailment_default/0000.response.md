The provided function `func_1` is intended to identify the list with the maximum length from a list of lists and return the length along with the first sublist of that maximum length. However, upon examination of the code and the provided output hints, there are significant concerns regarding error handling for edge cases.

1. **Empty Input**: The program will raise an error if `list_of_lists` is empty because the `max()` function will be called with an empty iterable. There is no error handling for this case, meaning the program does not perform correctly when given an empty input list.

2. **Indexing into an Empty List**: The code generates `max_sublists`, which consists of sublists matching the maximum length. If for some unforeseen reason this list were to be empty (although the logic indicates this shouldn't happen when there's a valid input), trying to access the first element `max_sublists[0]` will also raise an error.

Given these issues, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it lacks the necessary checks for edge cases like an empty `list_of_lists`. 

Correctness: **False**.
