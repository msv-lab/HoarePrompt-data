Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that finds a "list of maximum length" in a list of lists. The program instead returns both the maximum length and only the first sublist that has that maximum length, which does not satisfy the requirement of returning all lists of maximum length.

For example, consider the input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10]]
```

The maximum length among the sublists is 4 (from `[6, 7, 8, 9]`). The function would return `(4, [6, 7, 8, 9])`, but according to the problem description, it should return a list containing all sublists that have the maximum length, which in this case should be `[[6, 7, 8, 9]]`.

Thus, the program fails to return all maximum-length sublists and returns only a single sublist instead, which is not what the problem description specifies. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
