Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements because it only returns the first sublist among those with the maximum length, rather than all the sublists that have that maximum length. 

For example, consider the input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], [7, 8, 9, 10]]
```

The correct expected output should be `(4, [[7, 8, 9, 10]])`, because the longest sublist has a length of 4. However, the program would return `(4, [7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly for this case, but if the input were:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
```

The expected output should include all maximum length sublists, which are `[[5, 6, 7], [10, 11, 12]]` implying that the function should list them rather than just returning the first.

Thus, the program fails to handle every potential case as it does not return all maximum sublists, only one. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
