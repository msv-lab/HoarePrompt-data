Correctness: **False**.

The function provided is supposed to find the list of maximum length from a list of lists, but it only returns the first list of maximum length along with its length. This can be problematic if there are multiple lists of the same maximum lengthâ€”returning only the first one fails to fulfill the requirement of providing a list of all maximum-length lists.

For instance, if the input is:
```python
func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]])
```
The expected result should include all of the maximum length lists, which are `[5, 6, 7]` and `[8, 9, 10]`, instead of just one of them. 

Furthermore, if the function is called with an empty list of lists:
```python
func_1([])
```
It will raise a `ValueError` when trying to calculate the maximum length with `max()`, which is another case where the program does not work correctly. 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description fully, leading to a verdict of **False**.
