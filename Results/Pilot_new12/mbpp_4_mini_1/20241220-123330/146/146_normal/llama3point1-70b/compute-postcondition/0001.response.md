The variable `max_sublists` is assigned a list generated by a list comprehension that includes all sublists from `list_of_lists` whose length is equal to `max_len`. The value of `max_sublists` will be a list that contains some or all of the sublists that have the maximum length defined by `max_len`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists` is a list containing the sublists of length `max_len`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_sublists` is a list containing the sublists of length `max_len`.**
