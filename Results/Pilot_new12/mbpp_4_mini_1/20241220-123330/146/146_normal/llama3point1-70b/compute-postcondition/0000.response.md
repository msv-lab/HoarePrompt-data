The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` can contain sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest sublist among them. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, and `max_len` is the maximum length of these sublists.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.**
