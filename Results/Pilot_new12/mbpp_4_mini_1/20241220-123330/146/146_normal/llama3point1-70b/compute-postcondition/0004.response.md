Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns a tuple containing two elements: the maximum length of the sublists within that list and the first sublist found that has this maximum length. Notably, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise an error due to attempting to compute `max_len` and indexing `max_sublists`, which would not be valid. Additionally, if there are no sublists that share the maximum length (though logically impossible with the structure of the code), the result of taking the first element of `max_sublists` would also raise an error if it were empty. Thus, the function lacks error handling for these edge cases.**
