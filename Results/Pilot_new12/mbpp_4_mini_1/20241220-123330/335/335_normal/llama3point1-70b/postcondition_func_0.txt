The function accepts two parameters: a non-empty string (`string`) and a non-empty substring (`substring`). It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, it returns `None`. If found, it returns the `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence (a non-negative integer), and the end index (calculated as start + length of the substring - 1). The function does not handle cases where `substring` is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior, as it is assumed to be non-empty from the context. Additionally, there are no check for invalid input types, so passing non-string types would result in an AttributeError.
