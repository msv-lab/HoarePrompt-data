Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. According to the description, the function should return all occurrences and positions of the substring within the main string. However, the implementation uses `string.find(substring)` which only finds the first occurrence of the substring and does not search for any subsequent occurrences.

For example:
- If the input is `string = "ababcabc"` and `substring = "abc"`, the program would return `("abc", 2, 4)`, which is just the first occurrence. However, there is also a second occurrence of "abc" starting at index 5. The expected behavior is to return both occurrences.

Thus, since the program does not cater to all cases of occurrences, it is deemed incorrect.
