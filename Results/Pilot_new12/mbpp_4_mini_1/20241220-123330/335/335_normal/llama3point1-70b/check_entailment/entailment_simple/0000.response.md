Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description. While it correctly handles the situation when the substring is found by returning its occurrence and positions (start and end indices), it fails to account for all occurrences of the substring within the string. The problem description requires finding all occurrences and their positions, and returning `None` only if there are no matches. However, the program only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring. Therefore, it does not meet the explicit requirement of finding multiple occurrences of the substring.

In summary, the program is incorrect because:
1. It only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring and its position.
2. It does not return details for subsequent occurrences, which is required by the problem description. 

Thus, it does not meet the described functionality of the task.
