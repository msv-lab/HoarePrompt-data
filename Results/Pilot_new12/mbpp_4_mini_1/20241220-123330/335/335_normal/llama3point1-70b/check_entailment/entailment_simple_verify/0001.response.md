The program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string, returning `None` if the substring is not found. The original assessment states that the correctness is **False** because the program only handles the first occurrence of the substring and does not account for multiple occurrences.

The annotated version of the program confirms that the function `func_1` indeed only finds the first occurrence due to the use of `string.find(substring)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found. The function will return a tuple with the substring and its start and end positions, but it does not iterate or check for additional occurrences beyond the first one. This means that it does not fulfill the requirement to find all occurrences of the substring as implied in the problem description.

The original assessment is accurate for the following reasons:
1. The problem description indicates that all occurrences of the substring within the string should be found, yet the implementation only retrieves the first occurrence.
2. The annotations support this reasoning, illustrating that the state of the program shows examples where only the first match is retrieved and does not continue searching after that.

Thus, the original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's functionality in relation to the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
