Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string. This aligns directly with the problem description, which requests a function to find occurrences of substrings.

2. **Return Values**: 
   - If the substring is not found within the string, the function correctly returns `None`. This is specified in the problem description as a required behavior when there is no match.
   - If the substring is found, it returns a tuple consisting of the substring itself, the start index of its first occurrence, and the end index. This output format is consistent with providing information about the occurrence and position of the substring.

3. **Handling of Non-Empty Inputs**: The program assumes that both inputs (the string and the substring) are non-empty, as stated in the initial comments. Given the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided, the function performs as expected for all valid cases described.

Thus, since the function consistently adheres to the task specified in the problem description and accurately handles both cases (found and not found), it is deemed correct according to the given criteria.
