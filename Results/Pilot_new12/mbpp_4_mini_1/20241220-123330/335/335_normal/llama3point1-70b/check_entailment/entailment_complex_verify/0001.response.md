Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program: it only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring within the string, rather than all occurrences. According to the problem description, the function should identify and return all occurrences along with their positions. The program's behavior, as demonstrated in the example provided (e.g., `func_1("hello world, hello universe", "hello")`), confirms this inadequacy. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed incorrect in its current implementation.
