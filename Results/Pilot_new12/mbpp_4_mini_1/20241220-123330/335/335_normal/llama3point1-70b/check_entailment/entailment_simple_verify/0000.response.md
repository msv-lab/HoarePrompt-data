Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem clearly states that the function should find all occurrences and positions of the substrings within a given string, and return None if no matches are found. However, the program, as detailed in the annotations, only finds the first occurrence of the substring using `string.find(substring)`, which inherently limits its functionality to only detecting one occurrence.

For instance, considering the example provided in the original assessment:

- Given `string = "ababcabc"` and `substring = "abc"`, the program would return `("abc", 2, 4)`. This only captures the first occurrence at index 2 but misses the second occurrence that starts at index 5.

Thus, since the program fails to account for all occurrences of the substring and does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, the correct conclusion remains that the program is incorrect.
