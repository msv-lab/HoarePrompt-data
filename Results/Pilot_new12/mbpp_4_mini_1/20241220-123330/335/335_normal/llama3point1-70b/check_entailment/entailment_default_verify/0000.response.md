The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only finds the first occurrence of a substring and does not handle multiple occurrences. This is consistent with the provided problem description, which asks for the function to find all occurrences and their positions in the string, returning `None` only if there's no match.

The output hints confirm that the function currently uses `string.find(substring)`, which will indeed only locate the first occurrence of the given substring. The program does not iterate to find additional matches or collect them, meaning it does not fulfill the requirement to return all occurrences.

Moreover, the output hints also indicate that while the function behaves predictably with valid inputs, it does not validate those inputs effectively against some scenarios. However, the primary issue stems from its inability to capture all occurrencesâ€”this is a critical requirement as established in the problem description.

Given these considerations, the original assessment is accurate. The program fails to meet the complete requirements outlined in the problem description due to its inability to find multiple occurrences, which is a central aspect of the task.

Final: **False**
