Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the `substring` is empty. If an empty string is passed as the `substring`, the method `string.find(substring)` will return `0`, and the function will return `(substring, 0, -1)`, which does not make sense as positions in a string cannot have a negative end index. Furthermore, the assumption that both inputs are non-empty strings does not account for potential edge cases where an empty substring could be provided, leading to unexpected behavior.

Additionally, there is a lack of validation for input types, meaning that if non-string types are provided, it could raise an exception. Even though it is stated that valid inputs will be provided, a well-integrated function should ideally account for all edge cases, including input validation.

Overall, since the program fails for the case of an empty `substring`, Correctness is **False**.
