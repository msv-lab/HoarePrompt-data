Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is intended to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string, returning `None` if there is no match. While the given implementation does correctly find the first occurrence of the substring and returns the expected indices if found, it fails to account for several crucial potential cases. 

1. The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `substring` is empty. According to the problem description, if the substring is empty, there is no clear definition of what the expected behavior should be, thus leading to potential confusion and unexpected behavior since `string.find("")` would always succeed, returning 0 (the start of the string) as the position.

2. The function does not check for invalid input types. For instance, if a non-string type (like an integer or a list) is passed as `string` or `substring`, the program will raise an `AttributeError`. The lack of handling for such cases also indicates that the implementation does not meet all possible input scenarios expected from the problem description.

Therefore, due to the potential for unexpected behavior when the substring is empty, as well as how inappropriate input types could lead to errors, the code does not fulfill all requirements of the problem description for every potential case presented.
