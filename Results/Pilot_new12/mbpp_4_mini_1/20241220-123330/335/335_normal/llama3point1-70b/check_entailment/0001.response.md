Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. According to the problem description, it is implied that the function should find all occurrences and their respective positions. However, the provided code only finds the first occurrence of the substring and does not return any results for subsequent occurrences. 

For example, given the input `func_1("hello world, hello universe", "hello")`, the expected output should include both occurrences of the substring "hello" with their respective positions. However, the current implementation only returns the first occurrence:

```python
("hello", 0, 4)
```

A correct implementation should return a list of tuples, each containing the substring and its start and end positions. This discrepancy leads to a failure of the program to meet the requirements of the problem description.
