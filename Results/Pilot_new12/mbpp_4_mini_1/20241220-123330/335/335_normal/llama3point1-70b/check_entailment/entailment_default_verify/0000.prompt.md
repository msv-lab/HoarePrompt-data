You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. According to the description, the function should return all occurrences and positions of the substring within the main string. However, the implementation uses `string.find(substring)` which only finds the first occurrence of the substring and does not search for any subsequent occurrences.

For example:
- If the input is `string = "ababcabc"` and `substring = "abc"`, the program would return `("abc", 2, 4)`, which is just the first occurrence. However, there is also a second occurrence of "abc" starting at index 5. The expected behavior is to return both occurrences.

Thus, since the program does not cater to all cases of occurrences, it is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters: a non-empty string (`string`) and a non-empty substring (`substring`). It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, it returns `None`. If found, it returns the `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence (a non-negative integer), and the end index (calculated as start + length of the substring - 1). The function does not handle cases where `substring` is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior, as it is assumed to be non-empty from the context. Additionally, there are no check for invalid input types, so passing non-string types would result in an AttributeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
