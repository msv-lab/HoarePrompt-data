The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle multiple occurrences of the `substring` within the `string`. This reasoning aligns with the problem description, which specifically asks for the function to find all occurrences of the substring and return their positions. The provided program only locates the first occurrence of the substring due to the use of `string.find(substring)`, which indeed does not meet the requirement to find all occurrences.

The annotated version also confirms that the program only finds the first occurrence of the `substring`. It clearly indicates that if the `substring` is found, it computes and returns just the first occurrence's indices. No logic is present in the function to find further occurrences, thus demonstrating a lack of compliance with the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment that deemed the program incorrect remains valid. It is clear that the program does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
