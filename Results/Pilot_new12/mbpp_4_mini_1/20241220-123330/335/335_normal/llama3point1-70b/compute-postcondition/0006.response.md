The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings. After executing the function body, if `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. If `substring` is found, the function returns the `substring`, its start index (which is a non-negative integer), and its end index (calculated as the start index plus the length of the substring minus one). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `string` and a non-empty string `substring`, returning information about the position of `substring` in `string` or returning `None` if `substring` is not present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`; it returns `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or it returns `substring`, its start index, and its end index if found.**
