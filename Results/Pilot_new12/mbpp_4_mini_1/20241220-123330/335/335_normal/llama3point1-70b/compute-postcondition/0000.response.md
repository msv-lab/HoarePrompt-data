The variable `start` is assigned the value of `string.find(substring)`, which returns the lowest index of the substring if found in the string or -1 if not found. The values of `string` and `substring` remain unchanged regardless of whether the substring is found or not. Therefore, the output state considers both possibilities for `start` based on the presence of the substring.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1 if not found.**
