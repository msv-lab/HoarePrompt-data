The variable `end` is assigned the value of `start` plus the length of the `substring`. Since `start` is a non-negative integer and both `string` and `substring` are non-empty, `len(substring)` will return a positive integer. Therefore, `end` will be `start + len(substring)`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `end`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is a non-negative integer, `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`**
