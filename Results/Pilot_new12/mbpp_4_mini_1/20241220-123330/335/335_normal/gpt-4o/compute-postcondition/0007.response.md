Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string`, which is a string, and `sub_string`, which is a non-empty string. It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the starting index (`start_pos`) of its first occurrence, and the ending index (`end_pos`) which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns None. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `main_string` might be empty or where `sub_string` does not occur in it at all, returning None in those cases.**
