The `start_pos` variable is assigned the value of the position where `sub_string` is found within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, `start_pos` will be a non-negative integer representing the index of the first occurrence. If `sub_string` is not found, `start_pos` will be `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, and `start_pos` is either a non-negative integer (index of first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`) or `-1`.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is either a non-negative integer (index of first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`) or `-1`.**
