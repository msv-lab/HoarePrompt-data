Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the problem description requirements. The function `func_1` is supposed to find all occurrences of a substring within a main string and return their positions. However, it only identifies and returns the first occurrence of the substring, which is a clear deviation from the task of finding all occurrences. The output hints further clarify that the function's current implementation fails to handle cases where the substring appears multiple times, supporting the conclusion that the function does not fulfill the specification provided in the problem description. Therefore, the final correctness of the program is indeed **False**.
