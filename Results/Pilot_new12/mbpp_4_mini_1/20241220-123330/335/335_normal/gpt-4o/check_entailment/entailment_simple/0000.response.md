The provided Python program is designed to find the first occurrence and position of a substring within a given string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if it is found; otherwise, it returns None when the substring is not present.

Let's evaluate the program against the problem description:

1. **Correct Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`.
   - If `sub_string` is not found (`start_pos == -1`), the function correctly returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement of returning None if there's no match.
   - If found, it calculates the `end_pos` as `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns a tuple of the `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`.

2. **Handling of Output**:
   - The function's return matches the expected output format when a substring is found (a tuple containing the substring and its positions).
   - All assertions in the annotated program validate this functionality correctly, based on the expected outputs provided.

3. **Coverage of Cases**:
   - The checks in the problem and provided assertions cover cases where the substring is present in various positions and lengths, as well as a case where the substring does not exist at all.

4. **Final Assessment**:
   - The program correctly implements the problem's requirements, checking for the substring's occurrence and reporting its positions accurately.

Thus, given that the program meets the problem description's requirements in all expected scenarios, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
