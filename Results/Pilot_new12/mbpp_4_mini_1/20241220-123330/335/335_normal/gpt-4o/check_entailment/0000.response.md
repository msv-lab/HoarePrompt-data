Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` is not correct. The program correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring and calculates the starting and ending positions. However, the ending position is incorrectly calculated as `end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which includes the length of the substring in the ending position, whereas it should reflect the index of the last character of the substring in the original string.

For example, if we call `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')`, the expected output is `('python', 0, 5)` since the substring "python" starts at index 0 and ends at index 5 (the 6th character is not included). The current implementation would return `('python', 0, 6)`, which is incorrect.

Another example is `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')`. The expected output is `('programming', 7, 17)`; however, the current implementation incorrectly returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.

These discrepancies indicate that the function does not handle the calculation of indices correctly, making the overall implementation incorrect.
