You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string, and sub_string is a non-empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that the operation does not provide any value.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is a non-negative integer (the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`), which is not equal to -1.
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns 'sub_string', 'start_pos' which is a non-negative integer, and 'end_pos' which is equal to start_pos plus the length of 'sub_string'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string`, which is a string, and `sub_string`, which is a non-empty string. It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the starting index (`start_pos`) of its first occurrence, and the ending index (`end_pos`) which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns None. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `main_string` might be empty or where `sub_string` does not occur in it at all, returning None in those cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
