The program `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. 

**Explanation of the program logic:**
1. The program uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to find the starting index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `start_pos` will be `-1`.
2. If `start_pos` is `-1`, the function returns `None`.
3. If `sub_string` is found, the end position `end_pos` is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.
4. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

**Output Hints:**  
The output hints indicate that the function handles the basic cases where the substring is present or absent in the main string. It correctly returns a tuple of the substring and its positions or `None` if there's no match.

**Key Cases to Consider:**
1. If `sub_string` is an empty string, the program does not specify how to handle such a case. In Python's `str.find()` method, finding an empty string returns `0`, which might not be the intended behavior if the problem does not specify that empty strings should return an occurrence.
2. It accurately handles the cases provided in the assertions.
3. The program appears to work as intended with the provided examples, and it will return `None` for cases where the substring does not appear.

However, since the problem statement itself does not clarify or provide guidance on what should happen for an empty substring, this leaves ambiguity in functionality. For a well-defined program, it should specify behavior for empty substrings.

Thus, the output hints suggest that the function does not specify how it deals with edge cases like empty substring searches, which could lead to potentially incorrect interpretations in practical scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not handle the edge case concerning an empty substring, potentially leading to unexpected or incorrect results if such inputs are ever given. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
