The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to inaccuracies in the way the ending index (`end_pos`) is calculated. Specifically, it indicates that the ending index should reflect the last character of the substring in the context of the original string, which means it should be the starting index plus the length of the substring minus one (i.e., `start_pos + len(sub_string) - 1`).

The output hints reinforce this issue by stating that the function returns the ending index as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which does not correspond to the general convention of indicating positions in a zero-indexed string. According to the hints, the returning of `end_pos` as `start_pos + len(sub_string)` results in an off-by-one error, confirming that the original assessment is accurate and justified.

Given these points, the program does not meet the specifications laid out in the problem description. While it correctly handles cases where the substring is present or absent, it fails to provide correct output in the form of the expected ending index.

Therefore, I conclude:

Final: **False**
