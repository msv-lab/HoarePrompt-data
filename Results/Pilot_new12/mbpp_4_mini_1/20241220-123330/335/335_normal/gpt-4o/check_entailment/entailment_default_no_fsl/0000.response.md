Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring within the main string and returns the expected tuple with the starting and ending indices, if the substring is found. However, it does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. According to the problem description, it’s ambiguous whether we should return only the first occurrence or any occurrence, but the assert statements suggest that we are to find the first instance. 

Notably, the output hints mention that if `sub_string` does not occur in `main_string`, the function returns None. However, if the `main_string` is empty and there’s a non-empty `sub_string`, the function should also return None, but it does not explicitly handle this edge case.

For example:
- The function would return `None` if `func_1('', 'python')` is called, which is expected behavior, but it's not explicitly tested in the provided assertions.

Moreover, given the description and the output hints, there’s no guarantee that the function will work for all edge cases encompassing various possibilities of substrings in the main string.

To summarize, while the implementation works for the cases shown in the assertions, it does not cover the requirement comprehensively, particularly around edge cases, leading to incorrectness under the problem description.
