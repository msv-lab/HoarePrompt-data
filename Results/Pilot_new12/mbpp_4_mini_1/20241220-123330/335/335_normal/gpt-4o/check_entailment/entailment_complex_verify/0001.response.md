Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The key issue is that the function `func_1` only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring within the main string. According to the problem description, the function should identify all occurrences of the substring, not just the first. The annotated version of the code confirms this by explaining that the program uses `main_string.find(sub_string)`, which will only return the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string`. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement of returning all positions of the substring, leading to incorrect behavior under the defined problem constraints.
