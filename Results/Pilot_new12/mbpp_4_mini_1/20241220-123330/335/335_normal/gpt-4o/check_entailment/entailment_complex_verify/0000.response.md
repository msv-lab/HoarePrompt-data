Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate due to the incorrect calculation of the ending position of the substring. The function `func_1` indeed calculates `end_pos` as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which leads to an off-by-one error. This means when the substring "python" is found at index 0, the function incorrectly returns an ending index of 6 instead of the correct 5, as the substring ends before the index 6. The same issue is present in other examples highlighted in the assessment. The annotations, while they do explain the program's flow, do not rectify the underlying issue with index calculation, supporting the conclusion that the function does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description.
