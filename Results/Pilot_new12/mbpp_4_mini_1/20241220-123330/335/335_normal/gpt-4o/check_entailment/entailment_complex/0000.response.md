The provided Python program is meant to fulfill the problem requirement of finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returning `None` if there is no match. 

Here's an analysis of the code in relation to the problem description:

1. **Functionality of the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string` (a string) and `sub_string` (a non-empty string).
   - It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function subsequently returns `None`. This aligns with the requirement that if there is no match, the function should return `None`.
   - If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates the starting position (`start_pos`) and the ending position (`end_pos`) of the substring and returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The assertions provided check various scenarios including:
     - Finding a substring that appears in the string.
     - Finding a substring that does not exist in the string (correctly returning `None`).
     - The tests seem to account for multiple positions and substrings, matching the expected return values.

3. **Returning None**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `sub_string` does not exist in `main_string`, returning `None`.
   - This directly satisfies the conditions laid out in the problem description.

4. **Validating Edge Cases**:
   - As noted, since we are assuming valid inputs and no errors (such as empty strings or invalid types), the program behaves as intended according to the problem description.

After thorough analysis, it demonstrates correct behavior as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returns `None` if there is no match, meeting the requirements in the problem description.
