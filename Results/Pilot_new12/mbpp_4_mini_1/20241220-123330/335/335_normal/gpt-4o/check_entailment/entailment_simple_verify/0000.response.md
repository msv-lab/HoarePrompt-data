The original assessment of the program states that the correctness is **False**. After analyzing the function `func_1` and the problem description in conjunction with the provided annotations, it is clear that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly identifies the starting position of the substring; however, it calculates the ending position incorrectly, as it adds the length of the substring to the starting position instead of producing an index that represents the last character of the substring. 

For example:
- For the input `'python programming, python language'` and the substring `'python'`, the function returns `('python', 0, 6)`, but the correct ending position should be 5, resulting in the expected output `('python', 0, 5)`.
- Similarly, for the input `'python programming, programming language'` with the substring `'programming'`, the expected output is `('programming', 7, 17)`, while the function returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.

The annotations do not alter this behaviorâ€”they confirm that the program states the positions incorrectly. The assessment correctly identifies these flaws in the logic of position calculation.

Given all the provided information, I conclude that the function is indeed incorrect based on the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
