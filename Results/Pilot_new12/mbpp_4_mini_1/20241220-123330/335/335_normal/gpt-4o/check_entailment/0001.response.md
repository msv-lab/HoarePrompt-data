Correctness: **False**

The function is not handling cases where the substring occurs multiple times within the main string. According to the problem description, it should find all occurrences and their positions, not just the first one. 

For example, in the string `python programming, python language` with the substring `python`, the function will only return the first occurrence `(0, 6)` and ignore the second occurrence starting at position 25. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of identifying all occurrences and their respective positions, leading to incorrect behavior under the defined problem constraints.
