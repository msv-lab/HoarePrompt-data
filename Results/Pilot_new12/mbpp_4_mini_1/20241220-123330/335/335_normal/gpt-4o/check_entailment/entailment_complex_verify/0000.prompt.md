You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` is not correct. The program correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring and calculates the starting and ending positions. However, the ending position is incorrectly calculated as `end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which includes the length of the substring in the ending position, whereas it should reflect the index of the last character of the substring in the original string.

For example, if we call `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')`, the expected output is `('python', 0, 5)` since the substring "python" starts at index 0 and ends at index 5 (the 6th character is not included). The current implementation would return `('python', 0, 6)`, which is incorrect.

Another example is `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')`. The expected output is `('programming', 7, 17)`; however, the current implementation incorrectly returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.

These discrepancies indicate that the function does not handle the calculation of indices correctly, making the overall implementation incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string, and sub_string is a non-empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that the operation does not provide any value.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is a non-negative integer (the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`), which is not equal to -1.
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns 'sub_string', 'start_pos' which is a non-negative integer, and 'end_pos' which is equal to start_pos plus the length of 'sub_string'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string`, which is a string, and `sub_string`, which is a non-empty string. It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the starting index (`start_pos`) of its first occurrence, and the ending index (`end_pos`) which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns None. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `main_string` might be empty or where `sub_string` does not occur in it at all, returning None in those cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
