Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. It does this by utilizing the XOR operation (`^`), which produces a binary number that has bits set to `1` where `num1` and `num2` differ. The function then counts the number of `1`s in this result using `bin(...).count('1')`. If the count is equal to `1`, it means the two numbers differ by exactly one bit, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements.

- For all pairs of numbers, this logic is consistent:
  - If `num1` and `num2` are the same, the XOR will yield `0`, which has no `1`s.
  - If they differ in multiple positions, the count of `1`s will exceed `1`.
  - If they differ in exactly one position, the count will be `1`, resulting in a true output.

In conclusion, since the program covers all scenarios as stated in the problem description without missing any edge cases, it is correct.
