Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and checks whether they differ by exactly one bit. It achieves this by performing a bitwise XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`), which results in a binary number where each bit represents whether the corresponding bits of the two numbers are the same (0) or different (1).

The key steps that ensure the correctness of the function are as follows:
1. The bitwise XOR will yield a result (let's call it `result`) where bits are set to `1` wherever `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. The program converts this `result` to its binary representation using `bin(result)`.
3. It counts the number of `1`s in this binary string with `.count('1')`.
4. The function checks if this count is exactly `1`. If it is, then it returns `True`, indicating that `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit. If not, it returns `False`.

The function handles all edge cases described in the problem:
- If both numbers are equal, the XOR result will be `0`, leading to a count of `1`s being `0` (returns `False`).
- If they differ by more than one bit, the count of `1`s will be greater than `1` (returns `False`).

While the annotation mentions that the function does not handle non-integer inputs, according to the problem description, we are assuming inputs will always be valid integers. Hence, this limitation does not affect the function's correctness under the given assumptions.

Overall, the function correctly identifies when two integers differ by exactly one bit, aligning with the requirements of the problem description.
