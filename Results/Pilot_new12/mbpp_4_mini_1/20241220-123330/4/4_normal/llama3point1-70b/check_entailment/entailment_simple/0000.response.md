Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The task is to check whether two integers, `num1` and `num2`, differ at exactly one bit position. 

Hereâ€™s how the program accomplishes this:

1. The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of the two numbers. The result has bits set to `1` for each position where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.

2. The function then converts the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation using `bin(num1 ^ num2)`, which produces a string that contains the binary digits.

3. The method `.count('1')` counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation. If `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, this count will be `1`.

4. The function returns `True` if the count of `1`s is equal to `1`, indicating that the numbers differ at one bit position only. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Thus, the program adheres strictly to the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all valid integer inputs correctly.
