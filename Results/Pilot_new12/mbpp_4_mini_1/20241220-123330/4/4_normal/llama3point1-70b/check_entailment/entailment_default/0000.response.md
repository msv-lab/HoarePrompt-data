Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function correctly checks if two integers differ by exactly one bit using the bitwise XOR operation and counting the `1s` in the binary representation. However, while the primary logic checks valid cases, it does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to a TypeError. For example, if the function is called with a string or a float instead of integers, it will result in an error, thus failing to adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, especially regarding input types being strictly integers. Hence, it cannot be deemed correct in all scenarios.
