Correctness: **False**

The function checks if two integers differ by exactly one bit using the bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of `1`s in the result. However, it does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to potential errors. 

For instance, if the function is called with floating-point numbers, strings, or other non-integer types, it would raise a `TypeError`, which is not conforming to the problem description's expectation of correctly handling all potential cases with valid inputs. 

Therefore, since it does not work correctly for all potential cases (i.e., handling non-integer inputs), the correctness of the program is deemed false.
