To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` closely. The function is designed to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Here's the program again for reference:

```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operator (`^`) compares each bit of the two numbers. If the bits are different, it returns `1`; if they are the same, it returns `0`. Therefore, the result of `num1 ^ num2` will have `1` in those positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.

2. **Counting Differing Bits**: The `bin()` function converts the result of the XOR operation into a binary string representation. `count('1')` then counts how many `1`s are present in that binary string. If the count is exactly `1`, that indicates that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Equal Numbers**: If `num1` and `num2` are the same (e.g., `func_1(2, 2)`), then `num1 ^ num2` yields `0`, resulting in a binary string of `'0b0'`, and the output will be `False` (as expected, since they do not differ).

2. **Differing at One Bit**: For example, `func_1(2, 3)` (`2` in binary is `10` and `3` is `11`) should return `True`, as they differ at exactly one bit position.

3. **Differing at More Than One Bit**: For example, `func_1(2, 4)` (`2` is `10` and `4` is `100`) should return `False`, as they differ at two bit positions.

4. **Negative Numbers**: Consider the case `func_1(-1, 0)`. In Python, negative numbers are represented in two's complement. The bit difference here could produce unexpected results. The XOR of `-1` and `0` would be `-1`, leading to a binary representation with many `1`s, causing the function to incorrectly return `False` (it differs at many bit positions).

5. **Large Numbers**: For very large input values, the behavior remains consistent with the XOR bit operation, but it may be prudent to check with large numbers where one corresponds to a power of two (e.g., `func_1(2**30, 0)` should return `True`, while any non-zero integer differing at multiple positions should return `False`).

### Conclusion:

The primary potential failure point stems from how the function handles negative numbers, as they can result in more than one differing bit position when compared to positive numbers or zero.

Correctness: **False** 

The case `func_1(-1, 0)` will return `True`, while it should return `False` because `-1` in binary represents many differing bits from `0`.
