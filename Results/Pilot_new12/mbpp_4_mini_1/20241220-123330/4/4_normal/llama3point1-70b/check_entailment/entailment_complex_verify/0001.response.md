Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that the function `func_1` fails to produce expected results when handling negative numbers. Specifically, the case `func_1(-1, 0)` results in a binary representation that causes the function to return `True`, even though -1 and 0 differ at multiple bit positions. This discrepancy demonstrates that the function does not meet the problem description's requirement of checking for a difference at exactly one bit position. Therefore, the function is incorrect as it does not reliably handle all specified cases, particularly those involving negative integers, in accordance with the definition provided in the problem description.
