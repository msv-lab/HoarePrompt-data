The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are integers. After executing the function body, if `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `num1` and `num2`, and return `True` if they differ by exactly one bit; if they do not differ by exactly one bit, it returns `False`.  
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns `True` if they differ by exactly one bit; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
