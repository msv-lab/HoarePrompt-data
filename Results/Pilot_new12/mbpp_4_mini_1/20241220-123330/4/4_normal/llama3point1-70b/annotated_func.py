#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if num1 and num2 differ by exactly one bit, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, num1 and num2, and checks if they differ by exactly one bit. It accomplishes this by performing a bitwise XOR operation between num1 and num2, converting the result to its binary representation, and counting the number of `1s` in that binary string. The function returns `True` if the count of `1s` is exactly one, indicating that the two integers differ by exactly one bit. If the count is not one, the function returns `False`. This means that edge cases such as when both inputs are equal or when they differ by more than one bit are handled correctly by returning `False`. However, the function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to a TypeError.
