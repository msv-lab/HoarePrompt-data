Correctness: **False**

The program claims to check if two integers differ at exactly one bit position. However, there are certain edge cases it does not handle correctly. 

For instance, consider the input `func_1(0, 1)`. The XOR result would be `1`, which is a power of two because `1 & (1 - 1) == 0`. Hence, the function would incorrectly return `True` although `0` and `1` differ at one bit position, making the result misleading. 

The program does not correctly address the situation where one integer is `0`, which could lead to unexpected results regarding its compliance with the requirement of differing at exactly one bit position. 

Thus, the function does not work correctly in every potential case.
