To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function must check whether two integers differ at one bit position only.

### Functionality of `func_1`:
1. **Input Parameters:** `a` and `b` are two integers.
2. **XOR Operation:** The function computes `xor_result = a ^ b`.
   - The XOR operation will yield a binary number where each bit represents whether the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different (1) or the same (0).
3. **Check for Single Bit Difference:**
   - The function checks if `xor_result` is not equal to 0 (to ensure that `a` and `b` are not identical).
   - It also checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 by confirming that `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- If `a` and `b` differ by exactly one bit, then `xor_result` will be a power of 2 (e.g., for `a=2 (10 in binary)` and `b=3 (11 in binary)`, `xor_result=1 (01 in binary)`).
- If `a` and `b` are the same, `xor_result` will be 0, and the function correctly returns `False`.
- If `a` and `b` differ in more than one position, the function also correctly returns `False`.

Given the assertions in the annotated program, they all correctly evaluate scenarios as described:
- `func_1(13, 9) == True`: 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one position (the 2^2 place).
- `func_1(15, 8) == False`: 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at multiple positions.
- `func_1(2, 4) == False`: 2 (10) and 4 (100) differ at multiple positions.
- `func_1(2, 3) == True`: 2 (10) and 3 (11) differ at one position.
- `func_1(5, 1) == True`: 5 (101) and 1 (001) differ at one position.
- `func_1(1, 5) == True`: 1 (001) and 5 (101) differ at one position.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description by accurately determining if two integers differ by exactly one bit. The checks for being identical and the power of two condition are correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
