The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether two integers differ at only one bit position. Let's analyze how it addresses the requirements in the problem description:

1. The statement `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. The XOR operation will yield a number where the bits are set to 1 only for those positions where `a` and `b` differ. 
2. The condition `xor_result != 0` checks if `a` and `b` are different. If they are the same, the result will be 0.
3. The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if there is only one bit set in `xor_result`, which indicates that `a` and `b` differ by only one bit position. This works because a number that is a power of 2 has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.

The combination of these two checks ensures that the function returns `True` if and only if `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. The assertions following the function accurately reflect the expected outputs based on this logic.

Based on the analysis above, the function `func_1` is indeed correct as it meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
