Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The assertions in the test cases seem mostly correct at first glance, but there's an important aspect that can reveal an issue with the implementation.

The method used in the function utilizes the XOR operation to find the differing bits between `a` and `b`. The condition `xor_result != 0` checks that there is at least one differing bit, and `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if there is only one bit set in the result.

However, there are cases where the function may incorrectly identify that two numbers differ at exactly one bit position when it is actually not the case. 

For example:
- Consider `func_1(0, 1)`. The XOR result will be `1`, which has one bit set. The function will return `True`, implying that they differ at one bit.
- Now consider both `func_1(1, 0)` and `func_1(0, 1)` will also return `True`, which is expected.

More critically, let's analyze other cases:
- `func_1(7, 6)` should return `False` as the difference is at two bits (111 and 110 in binary). However, if we were to add checks, it could incorrectly show as `True` with careless implementation.

To solidify the errors:
- The code does not account for specifically checking whether those differing bits are alone, which could lead to false positives given different bit setups.

Thus, the provided code does not fully meet the problem requirements in every case, resulting in:
Correctness: **False**.
