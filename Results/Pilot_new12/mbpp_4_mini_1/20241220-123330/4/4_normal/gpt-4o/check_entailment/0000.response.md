To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function and check for any edge cases.

The problem description states that the function should check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. The program utilizes the XOR operation to check how many bits differ between the two numbers. The key points are as follows:

1. The `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bits where `a` and `b` differ.
2. The expression `xor_result != 0` ensures that the two numbers are not the same.
3. The expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if the result of the XOR operation has exactly one bit set, indicating that there is exactly one position where the numbers differ.

Now, let's consider edge cases relevant to this logic:

- If both numbers are the same (e.g., `func_1(4, 4)`), the function correctly returns `False` because `xor_result` will be `0`.
- If the two numbers differ at more than one bit position (e.g., `func_1(3, 0)`), it should return `False`, which it does since more than one bit would be set in the XOR result.
- If the two numbers differ exactly at one bit position (e.g., `func_1(2, 3)`), it returns `True`, which is expected.
  
Let's specifically check some edge cases:

- For `func_1(0, 1)`, it returns `True`, which correctly indicates that they differ at one bit position (the least significant bit).
- For inputs that are negative, such as `func_1(-1, 0)`, the function computes the XOR between the negative and zero resulting in `-1`, which will yield `True`, even though they differ at more than one bit.

Due to the behavior of how negative numbers are represented in binary (two's complement), the test case `func_1(-1, 0)` should return `False`.

This indicates that there is at least one case (`func_1(-1, 0)`) where the function does not provide the expected output according to the problem description.

Therefore, the conclusion is as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
