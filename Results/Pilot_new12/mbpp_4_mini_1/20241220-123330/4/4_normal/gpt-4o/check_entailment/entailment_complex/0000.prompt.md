You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #The program returns True if xor_result is not equal to 0 and is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns False, where xor_result is the result of a ^ b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation between these two integers and stores the result in `xor_result`. The function then returns `True` if `xor_result` is not equal to 0 and if it is a power of 2, which is determined by checking that `xor_result` AND (`xor_result` - 1) equals 0. If either condition is not met, it returns `False`. Edge cases include the possibility of both `a` and `b` being equal (which would result in `xor_result` being 0) or either of them being 0 (which also results in `xor_result` being 0). In such cases, the function will correctly return `False`. The function does not handle non-integer types as parameters, which may lead to unexpected results if such types are provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
