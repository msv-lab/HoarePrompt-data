The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. The function computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`, denoted as `xor_result`. It then checks if `xor_result` is not equal to 0 and is a power of 2. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return `True` if their bitwise XOR is not zero and is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of a and b is not 0 and is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns False.**
