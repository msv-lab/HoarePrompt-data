#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #The program returns True if xor_result is not equal to 0 and is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns False, where xor_result is the result of a ^ b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation between these two integers and stores the result in `xor_result`. The function then returns `True` if `xor_result` is not equal to 0 and if it is a power of 2, which is determined by checking that `xor_result` AND (`xor_result` - 1) equals 0. If either condition is not met, it returns `False`. Edge cases include the possibility of both `a` and `b` being equal (which would result in `xor_result` being 0) or either of them being 0 (which also results in `xor_result` being 0). In such cases, the function will correctly return `False`. The function does not handle non-integer types as parameters, which may lead to unexpected results if such types are provided.
