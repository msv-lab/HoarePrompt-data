The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` which is a tuple, and `lst` which is a list. The function returns the total count of the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` that appear in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the counts of each element from `lst` found in `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, then returns the total count of the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`.**
