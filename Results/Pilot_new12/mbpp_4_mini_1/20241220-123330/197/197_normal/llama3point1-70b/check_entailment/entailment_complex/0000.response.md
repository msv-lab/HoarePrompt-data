Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrences of all elements of a list `lst` in a tuple `tup`. This matches precisely with the stated problem description.

2. **Implementation**: The code utilizes a generator expression within the `sum()` function. It counts occurrences of each element in `lst` by calling `tup.count(element)` for each element in `lst`. This ensures that it accurately counts how many times each element of the list appears in the tuple.

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - If `lst` is empty, the generator expression produces no elements, leading to `sum()` returning 0, which is the expected behavior.
   - If `lst` contains elements that do not exist in `tup`, the count for those elements will simply be 0, which also aligns with the expected behavior.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem states that inputs will be valid, so edge cases involving type checking or handling empty inputs have been outlined with the understanding that valid input will be provided. Therefore, the function behaves as intended within the context of the problem description.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer that represents the total occurrences, which matches the result the problem description requires.

Overall, since every element of the problem description is met, it confirms that the program is correct.
