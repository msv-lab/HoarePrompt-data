Explanation: The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and output hints. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, then sums the occurrences of each element from the list that appears in the tuple. The logic correctly handles cases where `lst` is empty, returning 0 since there are no elements to count. It also correctly sums counts of elements in `lst` that may not appear in `tup`, yielding a count of 0 for those elements. 

However, since the problem description does not specify any restrictions on the inputs (like type checks), and given the assumption that valid input is always provided, the program should meet the requirements satisfactorily under the assumption that inputs are of the expected types (tuple and list). 

Therefore, considering all cases where valid input is provided, the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
