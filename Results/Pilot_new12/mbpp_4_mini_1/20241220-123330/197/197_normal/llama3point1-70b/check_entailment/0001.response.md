Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(tup, lst)` that accurately counts the occurrences of all elements in a list `lst` within a tuple `tup`. The use of `tup.count(element)` inside a generator expression allows it to efficiently sum the counts of each element in `lst`. 

The code handles all potential cases because:
1. If `lst` is empty, the result will be 0 since there are no elements to count, which is the expected behavior.
2. If `tup` is empty, the result will also be 0 regardless of the contents of `lst`, which is correct as there are no occurrences to count.
3. The function can handle any type of elements within the tuple and list, including duplicates, since the `count` method correctly counts each occurrence.

Given that no edge cases or shortcomings were identified that might cause the function to behave incorrectly according to the problem description, the implementation is confirmed to be correct.
