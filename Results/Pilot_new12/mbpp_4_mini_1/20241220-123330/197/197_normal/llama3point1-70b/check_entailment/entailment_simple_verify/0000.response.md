Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly states that the program is functioning as intended based on the problem description. The function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of all elements in the provided list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. 

The annotations clarify that at each step, the function retrieves the count of each element from `lst` in `tup` and sums these counts correctly. Additionally, the program caters to various scenarios, including handling empty inputs and ensuring that elements not included in the tuple return a count of 0. 

All provided reasoning in the original assessment aligns with the functionality demonstrated by the annotated version of the program, reinforcing the conclusion that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
