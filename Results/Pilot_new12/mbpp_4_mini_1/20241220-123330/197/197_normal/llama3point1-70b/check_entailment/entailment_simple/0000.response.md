Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. However, the annotated program does not simply count the occurrences of all elements but instead accumulates a total count by summing the results of calling `count()` for each element in the list, which is not the requirement. The correct approach should return a dictionary (or some similar structure) that lists each element from the list and its corresponding count of occurrences in the tuple. The current implementation reduces all occurrences to a single integer rather than giving the count for each element separately.

To be correct, the program should look something like this:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```

This way, it aligns with the requirement to count occurrences for all elements of the list in the tuple. Thus, the provided program does not meet the problem description's requirements.
