#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of the occurrences of each element in the list 'lst' within the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, then computes and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. It iterates through each element in `lst`, counts how many times that element appears in `tup`, and sums these counts. The function properly handles cases where `lst` is empty (returning 0) and where elements in `lst` do not exist in `tup`, resulting in a count of 0 for those cases. However, it does not account for cases where `tup` or `lst` is not provided or is not of the expected type (e.g., non-tuple or non-list inputs) and may raise an error in such situations. The function ultimately returns an integer representing the total occurrences.
