The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, and the parameter `elements` is a list of items that can be compared to the items in `tup`. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the occurrences of each element in the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and return the total count of how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup (a tuple) and elements (a list of comparable items), and returns the sum of the occurrences of each element in the list 'elements' within the tuple 'tup'.**
