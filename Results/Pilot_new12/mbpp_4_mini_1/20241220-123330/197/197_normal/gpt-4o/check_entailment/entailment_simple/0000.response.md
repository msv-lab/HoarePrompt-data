Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of all elements from a specified list in a given tuple. 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elements`, which is a list. This matches the requirement for the input types specified in the problem description.

2. **Count Logic**: The function uses a generator expression within a `sum()` function to iterate through each element in the `elements` list and counts how many times that element appears in the `tup` tuple using the `count()` method. This correctly implements the counting of occurrences for each element.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences across all specified elements, which aligns perfectly with the requirement stated in the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The given test assertions confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs, returning the correct counts for the occurrences of specified elements in the tuple.

Since the function operates consistently under the stated assumptions about valid input and produces the correct outputs as described, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
