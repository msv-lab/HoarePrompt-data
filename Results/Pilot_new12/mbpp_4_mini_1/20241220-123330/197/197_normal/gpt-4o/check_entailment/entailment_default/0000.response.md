The provided program `func_1` is designed to count occurrences of elements from a list within a tuple. The code uses a generator expression to count how many times each element from the `elements` list appears in the `tup` tuple and sums those counts.

Upon examining the output hints, they indicate that the function does indeed count occurrences correctly, even if the `elements` list contains items not present in the `tup`, which would simply contribute zero to the total count. 

However, we must also consider edge cases, such as an empty tuple or an empty list. The output hints suggest that the program will return `0` for these cases, which is valid since there will be no elements to count. 

Since the problem description implies that we need to count occurrences of all elements, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly without any errors or exceptions for valid inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
