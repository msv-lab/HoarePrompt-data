Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of all elements in a given list (`elements`) within a specified tuple (`tup`). 

Here's a breakdown of the reasons why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments, a tuple and a list. It computes the total occurrences of the elements from the list in the tuple using a generator expression combined with `sum`. This implementation aligns perfectly with the requirement to count occurrences.

2. **Handling Elements**: The `count` method is called on the tuple for each element in the list. This method accurately counts how many times each element from the `elements` list appears in the `tup` tuple.

3. **Returning the Correct Value**: The function returns the total count as expected. If an element from the `elements` list does not exist in the `tup`, its count will naturally contribute zero to the sum, which is correct behavior.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem description assumes that the input will always be valid and includes valid types that can be compared. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `tup` or `elements` can be empty, but given the assumption that inputs will be valid, the function performs correctly even in those cases by returning `0`, which is a valid and expected outcome.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided before the function definition act as test cases, confirming that the function behaves as required. Each test checks for correct counts based on the input provided.

Overall, since the function performs the task of counting the occurrences as specified, it follows the problem description accurately and thus is deemed correct.
