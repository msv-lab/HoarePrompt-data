To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we'll analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior with various potential inputs.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: The `func_1` function takes a tuple `tup` and a list of `elements`. It uses a generator expression to count how many times each element in the `elements` list appears in the `tup`, summing these counts.

2. **Correctness of Given Assertions**:
    - For the first assertion:
      ```python
      assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
      ```
      Here, 'a' appears 2 times and 'b' appears 1 time. The total is 2 + 1 = 3, which is correct.
      
    - For the second assertion:
      ```python
      assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
      ```
      Here, 1 appears 3 times, 4 appears 2 times, and 7 appears 1 time. The total is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is correct.

    - For the third assertion:
      ```python
      assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2
      ```
      Here, 1 appears 1 time and 2 appears 1 time, resulting in 1 + 1 = 2, which is also correct.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
    - If the `elements` list is empty, the function should return 0, since there are no elements to count in the tuple:
      ```python
      assert func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), []) == 0
      ```
    
    - If `tup` is empty, regardless of the `elements`, it should also return 0:
      ```python
      assert func_1((), ['a', 'b']) == 0
      ```
    
    - If `elements` contains duplicate items, the counts for each element should still be counted correctly, but we may want to see if it counts the duplicates:
      ```python
      assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'b'), ['a', 'a']) == 4  # Counts 'a' (2) twice, resulting in 4
      ```
    
4. **Conclusion**: Given that the function `func_1` behaves as expected for all provided cases and handles potential edge cases correctly, we conclude that the function is valid.

Correctness: **True**.
