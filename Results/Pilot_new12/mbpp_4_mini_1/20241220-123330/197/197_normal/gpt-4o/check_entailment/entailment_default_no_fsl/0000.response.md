Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of specified elements from a list in a given tuple. It uses the tuple's `count` method to sum the occurrences of each element in `elements`. The provided assertions in the program verify the functionality against some examples. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the elements considered:

1. **Handling of Non-Existing Elements**: The function correctly accounts for elements in `elements` that do not appear in `tup`. The `count` method returns `0` for such cases, which means that only existing elements contribute to the total count.

2. **Empty Inputs**: If either `tup` or `elements` is empty, the function will return `0`, as it does not find any elements to count. This behavior is valid and aligns with expected functionality, even if not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Valid Inputs**: The hint states that all inputs will be valid, thus avoiding type errors, and the function operates without exception, maintaining the expected behavior for given input types.

All provided assertions pass without error, confirming that the function satisfies its intended purpose for the demonstrated examples. There are no scenarios that break the function based on the given description and hints provided. Therefore, it is concluded that the function works correctly.
