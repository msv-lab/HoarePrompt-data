To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it against the problem description and consider different potential cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the occurrences of all elements in a list, found within a tuple.

### Provided Implementation:
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6`
3. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2`

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function counts the total occurrences of each element specified in the `elements` list, using the `count()` method of the tuple. The use of a generator expression to sum up counts appears correct for iterating over the elements.
   
2. **Testing Assumptions**: The provided test cases do confirm that the function does return the correct counts for those specific inputs. 

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Tuple & Elements**: 
   - `func_1((), [])` should return `0`, as there are no elements to count.
   
2. **Tuple with No Elements from List**:
   - `func_1(('x', 'y', 'z'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `0`, as none of the elements in the list exist in the tuple.

3. **Elements with Duplicates**: 
   - `func_1(('a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `5`, as there are three 'a's and two 'b's.
   
4. **Elements not Present in Tuple**: 
   - `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), ['d', 'e'])` should return `0`.

5. **Performance Case**: A large tuple with many repeated elements:
   - `func_1(tuple(['x'] * 10000), ['x'])` should return `10000` to verify performance on large sizes.

### Final Evaluation:
The logic used in the function is sound according to the problem description. The edge cases analyzed demonstrate that the function correctly counts occurrences of specified elements and handles various situations effectively.

Since I cannot identify a single case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the implementation is correct for the described task.

Correctness: **True**
