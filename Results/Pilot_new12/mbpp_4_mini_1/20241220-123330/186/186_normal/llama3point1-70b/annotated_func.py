#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from tuples 'tup1' and 'tup2'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the input tuples. The function assumes that both tuples are of the same length; if they are not, it could lead to unexpected behavior due to the way `zip` pairs items. The function does not handle cases where the elements in the tuples are not integers, which could result in a TypeError when attempting the bitwise AND operation.
