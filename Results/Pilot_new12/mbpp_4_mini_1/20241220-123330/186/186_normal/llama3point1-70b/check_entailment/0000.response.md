To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we first need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The description mentions "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." This generally implies that the function should perform an element-wise operation (in this case, a bitwise AND) and return a new tuple containing the results.

Now, let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses `zip` to combine the tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, creating pairs of corresponding elements.
2. It applies the bitwise AND operation (`&`) to each pair `(x, y)` from the zipped tuples, producing a new tuple filled with the resulting values.
3. The output returned is a tuple containing the bitwise AND of paired elements.

### Potential Cases:
- If `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple. Thus, any extra elements in the longer tuple will be ignored.
- If the tuples contain elements that cannot be operated on using bitwise AND (like strings or None), this will raise a `TypeError`.

### Examples to Illustrate Issues:
- Example 1: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would output `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)`, resulting in `(1, 0)`. **This is fine.**
- Example 2: `func_1((1, 2, 6), (3, 4))` would output `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)`, resulting in `(1, 0)`, but the last value `6` is ignored. **This might be unexpected.**
- Example 3: `func_1((1, 'a'), (2, 3))` would raise a `TypeError` due to `x & y` when `x` is a string. **This is a clear issue.**

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle tuples of different lengths properly by completely ignoring any additional elements in the longer tuple, and it raises errors when trying to perform bitwise operations on incompatible types. Thus, the implementation is incorrect for various input cases.

Correctness: **False**.
