The provided function `func_1` is designed to extract element-wise results from two tuples by performing the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements. 

The code uses the `zip` function to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, which is an appropriate approach as long as both tuples are of the same length. However, the output hints alert us to a significant issue: the function does not account for the situation where the tuples might not be of the same length. This can cause surprising output or incomplete results, as the `zip` function will only combine elements until the end of the shorter tuple is reached.

Furthermore, the hints also indicate that the function does not handle cases where elements in the tuples are not integers, which will raise a `TypeError` when performing the bitwise AND operation if the elements are of incompatible types (like strings or floats).

Therefore, since the program does not guarantee correctness under every potential case, specifically when the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-integer types, we conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
