To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requested functionality.

### Problem Description:
The task is to extract elementwise and tuples from two given tuples.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

1. **Logic**: The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the elements of the tuples. It uses `zip` to iterate over the tuples elementwise.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple that contains the results of the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

3. **Data Types**: The bitwise AND operation is typically performed on integers. If the tuples contain non-integer values (e.g., strings, lists, None), the code will raise a `TypeError`.

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the input where `tup1` and `tup2` contain non-integer values:
- Example: `tup1 = (1, 'a')` and `tup2 = (2, 'b')`.
- In this case, the program will fail because it cannot perform a bitwise AND operation on characters.

Hence, the code does not account for situations where the input tuples contain non-integer elements, and the program will encounter a TypeError at runtime instead of handling the error gracefully or returning a valid output.

### Conclusion:
Since there are valid input cases (like those with non-integer values) for which the program does not work as intended and raises an error, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
