You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requested functionality.

### Problem Description:
The task is to extract elementwise and tuples from two given tuples.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

1. **Logic**: The function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the elements of the tuples. It uses `zip` to iterate over the tuples elementwise.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple that contains the results of the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

3. **Data Types**: The bitwise AND operation is typically performed on integers. If the tuples contain non-integer values (e.g., strings, lists, None), the code will raise a `TypeError`.

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the input where `tup1` and `tup2` contain non-integer values:
- Example: `tup1 = (1, 'a')` and `tup2 = (2, 'b')`.
- In this case, the program will fail because it cannot perform a bitwise AND operation on characters.

Hence, the code does not account for situations where the input tuples contain non-integer elements, and the program will encounter a TypeError at runtime instead of handling the error gracefully or returning a valid output.

### Conclusion:
Since there are valid input cases (like those with non-integer values) for which the program does not work as intended and raises an error, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the input tuples. The function assumes that both tuples are of the same length; if they are not, it could lead to unexpected behavior due to the way `zip` pairs items. The function does not handle cases where the elements in the tuples are not integers, which could result in a TypeError when attempting the bitwise AND operation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
