Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. However, the function `func_1` implements a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples.

This means that if the tuples contain integers, the function is syntactically correct but does not produce tuples of extracted elements; instead, it produces a new tuple based on the result of bitwise operations, which is not what was specified in the problem description. 

For example, if the input tuples were `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the expected result based on the problem description would be the tuple itself, but instead, the function would return `(0, 0, 2)`, which does not meet the requirement of extracting elements elementwise.

Thus, the program does not implement the required functionality as stated in the problem description.
