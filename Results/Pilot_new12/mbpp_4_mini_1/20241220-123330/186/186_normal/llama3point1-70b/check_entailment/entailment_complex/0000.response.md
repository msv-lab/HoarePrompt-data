Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description as stated. The problem description asks the function to extract the elementwise results from the given two tuples, without specifying any particular operation to be performed between the elements of the tuples. However, the provided code implements a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

This means the function is performing a specific operation (bitwise AND) instead of simply extracting the elements, which does not align with the expectation set by the problem description. Furthermore, the code assumes the tuples contain integers to perform the bitwise operation, which is not guaranteed by the problem description.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as it applies a specific operation rather than merely returning the tuples or their elements. Therefore, it does not do what the problem description asks for every potential case.
