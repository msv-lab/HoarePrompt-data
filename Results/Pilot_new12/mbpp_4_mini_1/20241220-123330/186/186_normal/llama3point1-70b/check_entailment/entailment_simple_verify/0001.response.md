The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to its inability to handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to a `TypeError`. The assessment thoroughly analyzes how the program would behave with such inputs and concludes that the program's logic does not meet the expected functionality.

However, the problem description requires the program to extract elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. The code implementation does, in fact, perform elementwise operations (bitwise AND) on the given tuples. The annotations confirm that the function takes two tuples and correctly applies a bitwise AND operation elementwise.

Given that we are assuming valid inputs only (i.e., inputs that are guaranteed to be appropriate for the bitwise AND operation, such as tuples of integers), the program should function correctly under those circumstances.

Since it meets the requirements of the problem statement under the assumption of valid inputs, I would amend the original assessment.

Final: **True**
