The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a tuple containing the bitwise AND results of their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
