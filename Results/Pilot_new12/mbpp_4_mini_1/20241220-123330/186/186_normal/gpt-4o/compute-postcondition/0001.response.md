The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type. After executing the function body, it returns a new tuple that contains the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from these tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from tuple1 and tuple2.**
