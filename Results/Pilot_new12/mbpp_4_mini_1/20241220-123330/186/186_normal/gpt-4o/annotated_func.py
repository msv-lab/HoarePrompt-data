#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, where each element can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type. It computes and returns a new tuple that contains the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This function assumes that both tuples are of the same length and that the paired elements support the bitwise AND operation. If either tuple has a different length, the function may not behave as expected since `zip` will only process pairs until the shorter tuple is exhausted, potentially omitting elements from the longer tuple. Furthermore, if the elements are not compatible for a bitwise AND operation, this will raise a TypeError. Thus, the final state of the program is a tuple with the results of the operations, assuming no errors occurred during processing.
