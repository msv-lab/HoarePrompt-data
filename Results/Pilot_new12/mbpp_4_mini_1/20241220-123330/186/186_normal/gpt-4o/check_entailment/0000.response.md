To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the assertion tests.

### Problem description analysis:
The task is to extract the element-wise 'and' from the given two tuples. This means for each corresponding element in the two tuples, we should apply the bitwise 'and' operation.

### Program analysis:
The function `func_1` is defined as:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```
This function uses the `zip` function to pair up elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, then applies the bitwise 'and' operation (`&`) between them, and constructs a new tuple with the results.

### Assertions:
1. `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
   - Evaluates to `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3)`, which results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. This assertion is correct.

2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
   - Evaluates to `(1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8)`, which results in `(1, 2, 3, 0)`. This assertion is correct.

3. `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`
   - Evaluates to `(8 & 7, 9 & 13, 11 & 14, 12 & 17)`, which results in `(0, 9, 10, 0)`. This assertion is correct.

### Edge Cases:
We should also consider the following edge cases:
- An empty tuple: `func_1((), ())`
  - This should return an empty tuple `()`, which is logically correct.
  
- Tuples of different lengths: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`
  - This should ideally raise an exception since `zip` will only pair up to the shortest length of the tuples, resulting in `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))` returning `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)`, which evaluates to `(1, 0)`. This could mislead users expecting all elements considered.

### Conclusion:
The function works correctly for the provided assertions and the empty tuple case. However, it does not handle tuples of different lengths gracefully and produces results without alerting the user to potential input issues. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description's expectations for "all potential cases."

Correctness: **False**.
