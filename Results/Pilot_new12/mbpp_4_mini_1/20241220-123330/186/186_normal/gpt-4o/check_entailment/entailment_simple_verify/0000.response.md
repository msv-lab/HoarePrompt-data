Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function works correctly for the provided assertions but does not handle all potential cases appropriately. The original assessment raises valid concerns about handling tuples of different lengths, which the program does not address. While it assumes valid input, the issue of varying tuple lengths can lead to misunderstandings for users expecting the function to process all elements. Given this reasoning, the program does not fully meet the problem description's requirements for correctness across all use cases.
