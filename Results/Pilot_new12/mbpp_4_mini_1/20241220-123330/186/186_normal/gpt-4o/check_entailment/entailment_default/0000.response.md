The provided program `func_1` is designed to accept two tuples and perform a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements paired from both tuples. The function uses the `zip` function, which processes pairs until the shorter tuple is exhausted.

Upon examining the assertions:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`

These assertions appear to be well-formed following the intended functionality of the program. However, the output hints raise important considerations:

- The function does not handle cases where the lengths of the two tuples differ; in such instances, elements from the longer tuple would be omitted in the result without any warning.
- There is also a risk of a `TypeError` if non-integer or incompatible types are passed in, which, although assumed to be valid based on the problem description stating that elements in the tuples support the bitwise AND operation, could be problematic with invalid input.

For all cases given as examples in the problem description, the program behaves correctly, but it could lead to incorrect results or errors under the scenarios of different tuple lengths or incompatible types, which the hints highlight.

Thus, taking into account that the program does not cover these edge cases and could produce incorrect behavior when faced with them, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
