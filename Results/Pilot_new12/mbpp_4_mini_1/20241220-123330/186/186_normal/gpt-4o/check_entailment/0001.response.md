The provided program has the following structure:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

The function `func_1` is supposed to take two tuples as input and return a new tuple that contains the elementwise bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from both input tuples.

The test cases provided are:
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
```

Let's analyze the provided assertions against the function's logic.

1. **First assertion:**
   - `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - Elementwise operations:
     - 10 & 5 = 0
     - 4 & 2 = 0
     - 6 & 3 = 2
     - 9 & 3 = 1
   - Output is indeed (0, 0, 2, 1).
  
2. **Second assertion:**
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - Elementwise operations:
     - 1 & 5 = 1
     - 2 & 6 = 2
     - 3 & 7 = 3
     - 4 & 8 = 0
   - Output is indeed (1, 2, 3, 0).

3. **Third assertion:**
   - `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - Elementwise operations:
     - 8 & 7 = 0
     - 9 & 13 = 9
     - 11 & 14 = 10
     - 12 & 17 = 0
   - Expected output according to the assertion is (0, 9, 10, 0), but the program actually returns (0, 9, 10, 0), which is correct as well.

The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly computes the elementwise bitwise AND for all tuples provided in the assertions. Since all assertions hold true as described, there are no identified edge cases or inconsistencies.

Correctness: **True**.
