You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, where each element can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples containing elements that can be of any data type. It computes and returns a new tuple that contains the result of applying the bitwise AND operation on each corresponding pair of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This function assumes that both tuples are of the same length and that the paired elements support the bitwise AND operation. If either tuple has a different length, the function may not behave as expected since `zip` will only process pairs until the shorter tuple is exhausted, potentially omitting elements from the longer tuple. Furthermore, if the elements are not compatible for a bitwise AND operation, this will raise a TypeError. Thus, the final state of the program is a tuple with the results of the operations, assuming no errors occurred during processing.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
