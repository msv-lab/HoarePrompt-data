Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples". However, the provided implementation of `func_1` applies a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

There are several issues with this:
1. The term "extract" in the problem description does not imply applying any operations. It suggests producing tuples without modifying their contents.
2. The output tuples in the assertions (e.g., `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, etc.) indicate that the function is expected to perform a specific transformation that is not described in the problem (the outputs bear no obvious relation to the inputs in a way that seems reasonable or coherent).
3. There is no indication in the problem description that bitwise operations should be performed, nor that the output should produce any altered values based on those operations.

Since the program does not align with the expectations set forth in the problem description regarding what operations to perform on the input tuples, it is incorrect.
