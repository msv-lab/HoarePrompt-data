Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it assumes that both tuples will have the same length, which is not guaranteed. If the tuples have different lengths, the program will only compute results up to the length of the shorter tuple and omit any extra elements in the longer tuple. This can lead to loss of information. 

Moreover, the problem description implies that every element in the tuples should support the bitwise AND operation, but if the elements include incompatible types (for example, strings or lists), it would raise a TypeError. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect since it does not handle these potential edge cases correctly. For example, if we have `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, it would evaluate to `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)` resulting in `(1, 2)`, thus ignoring the last element of the second tuple, which violates the description's intent to extract elements correctly for both tuples.
