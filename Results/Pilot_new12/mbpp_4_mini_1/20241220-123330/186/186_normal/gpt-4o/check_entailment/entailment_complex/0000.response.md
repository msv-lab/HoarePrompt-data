To determine the correctness of the annotated program, we need to focus on whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

**Problem Description:**  
The function must extract elementwise results from the given two tuples.  

**Annotated Program Explanation:**  
The function `func_1(tuple1, tuple2)` processes two tuples elementwise, using the bitwise AND operation (`&`) between each corresponding pair of elements. This is done through the `zip()` function, which pairs elements from both tuples. The result is returned as a new tuple containing the result of these operations.

**Key Points from the Program:**
1. The function assumes that both tuples have the same length, although there is no explicit check for this in the code. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will only for `zip` until the shorter tuple is exhausted, effectively dropping excess elements from the longer tuple.
2. The operation performed is a bitwise AND, which is valid only for compatible data types (e.g., integers). If the elements are of different data types that do not support the bitwise AND operation, a `TypeError` will occur. However, the assumption is made that inputs will always be valid.
3. The program returns a tuple of results from the bitwise AND operation, consistent with the outputs in the provided assertions.

**Correctness Evaluation:**
- The program correctly implements the elementwise operation as required by the problem description. 
- However, it assumes that the inputs will be valid and does not handle cases of different tuple lengths or incompatible types. Yet, since we assume valid input in this task, it is operationally correct within the scope given.

Given these considerations, the function follows the problem description for the expected valid input scenarios.

**Correctness: True**
