The provided function `func_1` aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks whether the number of elements (`n`) is less than 2; if it is, the function correctly returns 0. This part aligns with the problem description.

Next, the function sorts the array and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements. The calculation seems appropriate since the sorted order will ensure that the smallest difference between elements will be among the adjacent pairs.

The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where input duplicates are present. However, this is actually misleading. The function inherently handles duplicates correctly because if any two adjacent elements are the same, the difference will be zero, which is valid and will accurately represent the minimum difference between elements. 

Moreover, the assertion tests provided (`func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6)`, etc.) also support that the function behaves correctly for the given input scenarios.

Also, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)`, which is not explicitly checked against potential inconsistent inputs (though the hint seems to imply this as a problem). However, since we are instructed to assume valid input, this does not invalidate the correctness of the implementation.

After considering all potential cases and analyzing the output hints in correlation to the function's logic, there does not seem to be a failure case that contradicts the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
