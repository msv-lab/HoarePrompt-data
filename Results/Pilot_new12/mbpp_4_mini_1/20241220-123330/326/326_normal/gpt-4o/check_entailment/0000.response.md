Correctness: **False**.

The primary issue with the program is that it doesn't handle the case when the array contains only one element. According to the problem description, when we have an array of size less than 2, the function should return `0`. However, the current implementation returns `0` correctly for that case, but does not follow the requirement when the array is empty (with `n = 0`). 

Moreover, the `assert` statements provided before the function definition do not validate against an empty array at all. If we test the function with an empty array (e.g., `func_1((), 0)`), it doesn't return a defined result, leading to undefined behavior.

Here's a potential failure case:
- Input: `func_1((), 0)` should return `0`, but calling it does not yield the expected output according to the descriptions.

Thus, the function is incorrect because it lacks adequate handling for arrays of length less than 2 and fails to cater to all potential edge cases, primarily when the input is an empty array.
