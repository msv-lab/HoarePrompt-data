Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains duplicates. As per the problem description, it is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two distinct elements in the array. If there are duplicates, the difference will be zero, which is misleading in the context of finding the "minimum difference" if the distinct elements are expected.

For example, given the input `arr = (1, 2, 2, 5)` with duplicates of the number `2`, the function will return `0`, but the minimum difference among distinct elements should be `1` (between `1` and `2`). Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem for every potential case, resulting in an incomplete and therefore incorrect solution.
