You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array contains fewer than two distinct elements properly. If the input array has only one element or all elements are the same, the program should return a meaningful output related to the absence of a minimum difference. However, the function currently returns 0 when the length `n` is less than 2, which may be misleading.

For example, given the input `(5, 5, 5, 5, 5)` with `n` equal to 5, the program would incorrectly suggest that there is no minimum difference, whereas all elements being the same would mean the minimum difference should be zero. However, the program's output (which is computed by returning the distance between sorted elements) does not address the input's uniformity or lack of distinct pairs.

Therefore, it fails to account for edge cases involving uniform arrays or arrays with insufficient size to form comparisons.

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not work according to the problem statement, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` which represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list. The minimum difference `min_diff` is then returned. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain duplicates; however, if duplicates are present, the minimum difference returned will be zero, as adjacent duplicates will yield a difference of zero. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if this condition is violated.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
