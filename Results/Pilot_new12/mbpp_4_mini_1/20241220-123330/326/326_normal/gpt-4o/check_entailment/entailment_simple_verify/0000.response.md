Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle the edge case of an empty array correctly. According to the problem description, when the input array's size is less than 2, the function should return `0`. The code correctly returns `0` in the case where `n < 2`, but this does not address the problem of providing a defined result for an empty array. 

The assertion statements present in the code do not check for this scenario where `n` equals `0` (an empty array). This situation leads to undefined behavior, as indicated in the assessment. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements adequately for all potential input cases. The annotations confirm that the function assumes `n` to be a positive integer at the time of processing, which means it overlooks an important input scenario. 

Thus, the original assessment remains valid, and the function cannot be considered correct under the given problem constraints.
