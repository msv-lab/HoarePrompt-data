Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to the following issues:

1. The problem description requires the function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the implementation only considers the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted array. As such, it fails to consider differences between non-adjacent elements which could potentially yield a smaller difference.

2. The provided assertions assume certain expected results but do not account for duplicates in the array. If duplicates are present, the function would return a minimum difference of 0, which might not be the case for unique elements.

3. Additionally, the program returns 0 when `n < 2`, but according to the problem description, it does not specify what should happen in this case. The function should instead either raise an error or handle it appropriately, since it does not meet the criteria given that a minimum difference cannot be computed with fewer than two elements.

Therefore, the implementation is incorrect with respect to the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program does not do what the problem description asks for in every potential scenario.
