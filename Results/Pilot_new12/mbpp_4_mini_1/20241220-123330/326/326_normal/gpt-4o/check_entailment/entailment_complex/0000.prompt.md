You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the current value of n is less than 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of `arr`, which is at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between adjacent elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list of integers 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` which represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list. The minimum difference `min_diff` is then returned. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain duplicates; however, if duplicates are present, the minimum difference returned will be zero, as adjacent duplicates will yield a difference of zero. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if this condition is violated.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
