Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes in an array `arr` of integers and an integer `n` which denotes the length of the array. It properly checks if `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case, although this case won't typically arise given the problem description's assumption about valid input. 

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array is sorted first using `arr = sorted(arr)`. This is essential because to find the minimum difference between any two elements, it simplifies the problem by ensuring that we only need to check the differences between adjacent elements in the sorted list.

3. **Calculating Minimum Difference**:
   - The program initializes `min_diff` with `float('inf')`, which is a common approach to ensure that any calculated difference will be smaller than this initial value.
   - It then employs a loop to iterate through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements (`arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`).
   - If a calculated difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`. This ensures that by the end of the loop, `min_diff` holds the minimum difference found in the sorted array.

4. **Returning Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which accurately reflects the minimum difference between any two elements in the provided array.

The program has been verified against multiple assertions that check if it returns the expected results for various inputs, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the program adheres fully to the problem description.
