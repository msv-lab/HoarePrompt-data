You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The primary issue with the program is that it doesn't handle the case when the array contains only one element. According to the problem description, when we have an array of size less than 2, the function should return `0`. However, the current implementation returns `0` correctly for that case, but does not follow the requirement when the array is empty (with `n = 0`). 

Moreover, the `assert` statements provided before the function definition do not validate against an empty array at all. If we test the function with an empty array (e.g., `func_1((), 0)`), it doesn't return a defined result, leading to undefined behavior.

Here's a potential failure case:
- Input: `func_1((), 0)` should return `0`, but calling it does not yield the expected output according to the descriptions.

Thus, the function is incorrect because it lacks adequate handling for arrays of length less than 2 and fails to cater to all potential edge cases, primarily when the input is an empty array.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` which represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list. The minimum difference `min_diff` is then returned. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain duplicates; however, if duplicates are present, the minimum difference returned will be zero, as adjacent duplicates will yield a difference of zero. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if this condition is violated.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
