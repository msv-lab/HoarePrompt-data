Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array contains fewer than two distinct elements properly. If the input array has only one element or all elements are the same, the program should return a meaningful output related to the absence of a minimum difference. However, the function currently returns 0 when the length `n` is less than 2, which may be misleading.

For example, given the input `(5, 5, 5, 5, 5)` with `n` equal to 5, the program would incorrectly suggest that there is no minimum difference, whereas all elements being the same would mean the minimum difference should be zero. However, the program's output (which is computed by returning the distance between sorted elements) does not address the input's uniformity or lack of distinct pairs.

Therefore, it fails to account for edge cases involving uniform arrays or arrays with insufficient size to form comparisons.

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not work according to the problem statement, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
