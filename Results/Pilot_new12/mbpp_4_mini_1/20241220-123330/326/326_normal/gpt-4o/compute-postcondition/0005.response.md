According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times, which requires that `n` is at least 2 (as specified, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2). As the loop starts, `i` must also be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

At the start of the loop:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is equal to the length of `arr`, which is at least 2.
- When the loop starts, `i` will be 0 and will increment on each iteration.

With these observations in mind, the state needs to reflect that `i` is initially set to 0 for the loop to prepare for execution.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` is 0**
