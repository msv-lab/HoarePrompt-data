`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is already defined as `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
