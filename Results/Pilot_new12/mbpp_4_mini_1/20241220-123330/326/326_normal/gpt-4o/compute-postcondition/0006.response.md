`diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which calculates the difference between two consecutive integers in the sorted list `arr`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so it accesses the first two elements of `arr`. This does not affect any other variables, but we now have the specific value of `diff`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer at least 2, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer at least 2, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**
