The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and the parameter `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function calculates and returns `min_diff`, which represents the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list of integers `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and its length `n`, return 0 if `n` is less than 2, and return the minimum difference between adjacent elements in `arr` when `n` is 2 or more. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` (which is the length of `arr`). It returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
