`diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this means `diff` will now be equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. There are no changes to the other variables' states, thus the updated value of `diff` reflects the difference between the elements at indices 3 and 2 of the sorted list `arr`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**
