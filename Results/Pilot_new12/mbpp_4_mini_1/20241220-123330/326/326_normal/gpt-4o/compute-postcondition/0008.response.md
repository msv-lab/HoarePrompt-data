The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Given that the current value of `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, which is less than `min_diff`, this assignment updates `min_diff` to become `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer at least 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**
