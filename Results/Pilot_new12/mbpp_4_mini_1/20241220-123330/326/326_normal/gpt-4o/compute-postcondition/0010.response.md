According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` is currently 0, after the next increment `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n - 1` must hold true, which means `n` needs to be at least 3 (since `i` will be 1 after the increment, and we need 1 < 2 for `n=3`).

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `min_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is less than the current `min_diff`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
