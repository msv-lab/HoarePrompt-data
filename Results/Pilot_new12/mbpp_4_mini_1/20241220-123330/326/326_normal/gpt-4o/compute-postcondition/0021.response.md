Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` which represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list. The minimum difference `min_diff` is then returned. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain duplicates; however, if duplicates are present, the minimum difference returned will be zero, as adjacent duplicates will yield a difference of zero. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if this condition is violated.**
