The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The length of `arr`, denoted by `n`, remains unchanged since the sorting operation does not alter the number of elements in the list. Therefore, after executing the code, `arr` will have its elements arranged in sorted order.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to the length of the sorted `arr`**.
