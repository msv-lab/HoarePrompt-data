`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is calculated as `arr[3] - arr[2]`, which is a specific difference between two elements in the sorted list `arr`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2] and `min_diff` is equal to `diff`.**
