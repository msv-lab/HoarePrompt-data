The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). The values of the other variables (`arr` and `n`) remain unchanged since the code only affects `min_diff`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to the length of the sorted `arr`, and `min_diff` is infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to the length of the sorted `arr`, `min_diff` is float('inf').**
