The value of `diff` is reassigned to `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 1, we have `diff = arr[2] - arr[1]`. The previous value of `diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The initial conditions of `arr` being a sorted list of integers, and `n` being at least 3, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3; `i` is 1; `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3; `i` is 1; `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]**.
