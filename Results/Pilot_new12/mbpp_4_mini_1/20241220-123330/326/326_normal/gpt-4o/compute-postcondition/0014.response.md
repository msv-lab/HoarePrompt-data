According to the code, the loop executes while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. This means that the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied, as 1 is less than 2 (which is `n - 1`).

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to run again, `n` must remain at least 3 (so that `n - 1` is at least 2) at the start of the iteration.

The difference `diff` will be calculated using `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` in this iteration as well. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, we need to reflect these updates.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `diff` is the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`.**
