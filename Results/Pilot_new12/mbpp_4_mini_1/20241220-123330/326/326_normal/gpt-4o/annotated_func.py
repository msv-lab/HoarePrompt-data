#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the current value of n is less than 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of `arr`, which is at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between adjacent elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list of integers 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` which represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted list. The minimum difference `min_diff` is then returned. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain duplicates; however, if duplicates are present, the minimum difference returned will be zero, as adjacent duplicates will yield a difference of zero. Additionally, the function assumes that `n` is always equal to `len(arr)` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if this condition is violated.
