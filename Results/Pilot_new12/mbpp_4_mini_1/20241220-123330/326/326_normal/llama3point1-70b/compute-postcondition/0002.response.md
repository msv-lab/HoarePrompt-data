According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr`. The loop will execute if `len(arr) - 1` is at least 1, which means `len(arr)` must be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, at the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(arr) - 2`.

So for the loop to be executed, the array must contain at least 2 elements, and `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
