The statement `min_diff = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `min_diff`. This does not affect any other variables, so the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables while indicating the specific assignment made to `min_diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity**
