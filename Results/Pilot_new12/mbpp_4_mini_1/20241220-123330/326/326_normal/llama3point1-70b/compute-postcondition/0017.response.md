The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
