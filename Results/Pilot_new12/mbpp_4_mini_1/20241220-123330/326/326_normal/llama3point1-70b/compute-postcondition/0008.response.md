The value of `diff` is assigned the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. The variable `min_diff` is still equal to `abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i + 2]) if i + 1 is less than len(arr) - 1`, but its value does not change. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i + 2]) if i + 1 is less than `len(arr) - 1`; `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`.**
