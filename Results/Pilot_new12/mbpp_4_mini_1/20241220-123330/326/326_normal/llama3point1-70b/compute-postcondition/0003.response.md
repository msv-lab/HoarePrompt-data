The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in the sorted list `arr`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, the calculation of `diff` will yield a non-negative integer value. The values of `arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged after this execution. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])**
