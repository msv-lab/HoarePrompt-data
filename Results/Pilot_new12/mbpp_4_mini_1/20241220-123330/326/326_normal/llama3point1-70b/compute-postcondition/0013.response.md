The operation attempts to assign the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. However, this action causes an out-of-bounds error due to the value of `diff` being accessed incorrectly, which likely occurs when trying to reference an index that exceeds the bounds of the `arr` list.

Since `min_diff` is unchanged before the operation and thereâ€™s an indication of an error without a valid assignment being made, the status indicates that the operation was interrupted due to the error.

Thus, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `min_diff` is unchanged, and the operation causes an out-of-bounds error.**
