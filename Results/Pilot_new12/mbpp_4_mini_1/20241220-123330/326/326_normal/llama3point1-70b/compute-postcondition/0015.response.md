Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `min_diff` remains positive infinity.**
