According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the array `arr`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and since `i` was at its last valid index (which is `len(arr) - 2`), on the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

To allow for one more execution of the loop, `i` should be increased to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last valid index for the current range.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `min_diff` is unchanged.**
