According to the code, the for loop executes as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. In the previous iteration, `i` would have been at some value such that `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, it must have a length of at least 2. 

At the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `k + 1`, and we also need to ensure that `k + 1` is still less than `len(arr) - 1`.

So we have:
- `i` is incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue should still hold, which means `i + 1` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute another time, `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i + 2]) if `i + 1` is less than `len(arr) - 1`** (keeping the current value of `min_diff` if it's less than that).
