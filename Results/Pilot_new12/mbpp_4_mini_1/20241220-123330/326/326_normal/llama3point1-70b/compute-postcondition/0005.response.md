In the given scenario, we have the following initial state of the variables:

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`, which implies it is a positive integer.
- The current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`.

The line of code executed is:
```
min_diff = diff
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code:

- The variable `min_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`.
- Since `diff` is less than `min_diff`, this means that `min_diff` changes from positive infinity to the current value of `diff`, which is non-negative.

Since the values of `arr`, `target`, `i`, and `diff` do not change with this assignment, the output state reflects the new value of `min_diff` while maintaining the state of other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])**.
