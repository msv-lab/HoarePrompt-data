Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requests finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, but the program only computes the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 3, 7, 8]`. The minimum difference between any two elements is `1` (between `7` and `8`), but the function would return the difference between the consecutive elements `1` and `3`, which is `2`. 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the task as required by the problem description, leading to its incorrectness. A correct implementation would need to compare all pairs of elements in the array rather than just consecutive ones.
