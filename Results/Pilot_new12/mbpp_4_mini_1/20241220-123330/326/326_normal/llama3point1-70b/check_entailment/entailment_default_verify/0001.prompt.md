You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided function has a flaw in its logic that prevents it from correctly finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

### Issue:
1. The function currently only calculates the difference between consecutive elements after sorting the array (i.e., `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`). This misses the case where the minimum difference may exist between non-consecutive elements in the original, unsorted array.

### Example Case:
For an input array like `[1, 3, 5, 10]`, the sorted version will be `[1, 3, 5, 10]`, and the function will compute:
- Difference between 1 and 3 = 2
- Difference between 3 and 5 = 2
- Difference between 5 and 10 = 5

The minimum difference returned is 2, which is correct in this case. However, consider an input like `[1, 4, 3]`. When sorted, it becomes `[1, 3, 4]`. The function will compute:
- Difference between 1 and 3 = 2
- Difference between 3 and 4 = 1

So the correct minimum difference would be 1. This works in this example, but it does not handle the general logic for all configurations since the logic only addresses adjacent values post-sorting. 

If we had a larger array such as `[1, 10, 22, 15, 30]`, the minimum difference should be between the elements `10` and `15` yielding `5`. The current logic would still only compare sorted adjacent values.

Thus, since the solution does not account for all cases of potential pairs, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the requirements of finding the minimum difference between any two elements without restrictions. Hence, the answer must be:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It sorts the input list `arr` and computes the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in this sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference as an integer. If `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function returns positive infinity (`float('inf')`), indicating that it is not possible to compute a difference. The `target` parameter is present but unused in the function's logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
