The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only computes the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, potentially missing the minimum difference that might occur between non-consecutive elements in the original, unsorted array.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is confirmed that the function indeed calculates the difference solely between consecutive elements of the sorted array. Specifically, the annotation states that `min_diff` is only set to the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements. This logic inherently fails to account for minimum differences that may exist between non-adjacent elements, which is critical for meeting the problem description accurately.

As illustrated in the provided examples and the reasoning behind the original assessment, while the current logic holds true for certain specific cases (like the one with coordinates `[1, 4, 3]` returning the minimum difference `1`), it does not generalize to all possible configurations of input arrays. The algorithm is incomplete, as it fails to consider all element pairs in the original array.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is valid due to the inability of the function to address the requirements outlined in the problem description adequately.

Final: **False**
