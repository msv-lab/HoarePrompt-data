Correctness: **False**

The provided function has a flaw in its logic that prevents it from correctly finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

### Issue:
1. The function currently only calculates the difference between consecutive elements after sorting the array (i.e., `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`). This misses the case where the minimum difference may exist between non-consecutive elements in the original, unsorted array.

### Example Case:
For an input array like `[1, 3, 5, 10]`, the sorted version will be `[1, 3, 5, 10]`, and the function will compute:
- Difference between 1 and 3 = 2
- Difference between 3 and 5 = 2
- Difference between 5 and 10 = 5

The minimum difference returned is 2, which is correct in this case. However, consider an input like `[1, 4, 3]`. When sorted, it becomes `[1, 3, 4]`. The function will compute:
- Difference between 1 and 3 = 2
- Difference between 3 and 4 = 1

So the correct minimum difference would be 1. This works in this example, but it does not handle the general logic for all configurations since the logic only addresses adjacent values post-sorting. 

If we had a larger array such as `[1, 10, 22, 15, 30]`, the minimum difference should be between the elements `10` and `15` yielding `5`. The current logic would still only compare sorted adjacent values.

Thus, since the solution does not account for all cases of potential pairs, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the requirements of finding the minimum difference between any two elements without restrictions. Hence, the answer must be:

Correctness: **False**
