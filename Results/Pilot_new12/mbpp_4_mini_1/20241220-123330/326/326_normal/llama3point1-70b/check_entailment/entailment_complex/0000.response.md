Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set by the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the provided program only calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. 

This is a limitation because there could be cases where the minimum difference is not between consecutive elements. For example, consider the array `[1, 5, 3]`. The function would calculate the differences between sorted consecutive elements (1 and 3, then 3 and 5) and return `1` as the minimum difference. However, there is another pair—1 and 5—that has a difference of `4`. 

Thus, the function does not guarantee finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, which is the requirement stated in the problem description. Because of this discrepancy, the program is not correct.
