Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, it does not account for cases where the array has fewer than two elements. In such cases, the function would still return `inf` (infinity), which is not a valid result for minimum difference.

For example, if the input is `[]` (an empty array) or `[1]` (an array with a single element), the function would not be able to determine any difference and would return infinity instead. The expected behavior for these cases should likely be to raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the minimum difference cannot be calculated.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
