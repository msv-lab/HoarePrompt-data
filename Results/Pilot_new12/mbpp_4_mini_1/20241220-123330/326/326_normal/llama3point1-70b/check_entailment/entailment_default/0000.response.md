Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description in that it finds the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the given array. It sorts the array and computes the differences between consecutive elements, updating the minimum difference as necessary. However, the output hints indicate that if the input array contains fewer than two elements, the function returns positive infinity (`float('inf')`). According to the problem description, we should explicitly handle this case as well, returning a meaningful value such as zero or an error message when there are not enough elements to compute a difference. The unused `target` parameter is also a sign of incomplete functionality according to the problem description. 

Since the program does not account for the scenario when the input array has fewer than two elements and does not provide any meaningful response, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
