The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It sorts the input list `arr` and computes the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in this sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference as an integer. If `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function returns positive infinity (`float('inf')`), indicating that it is not possible to compute a difference. The `target` parameter is present but unused in the function's logic.
