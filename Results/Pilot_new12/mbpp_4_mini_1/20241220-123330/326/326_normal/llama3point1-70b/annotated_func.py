#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])

            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr', which is stored in 'min_diff'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It sorts the input list `arr` and computes the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in this sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference as an integer. If `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function returns positive infinity (`float('inf')`), indicating that it is not possible to compute a difference. The `target` parameter is present but unused in the function's logic.
