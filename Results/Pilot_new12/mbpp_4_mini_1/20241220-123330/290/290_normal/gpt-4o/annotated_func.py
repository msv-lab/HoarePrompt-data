#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length of at least 1.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, since 'z' is present in the substring of 's' that excludes the first and last characters, and 's' has a length of at least 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, and the character 'z' is not present in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string with a length of at least 1. It checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters. If 'z' is found in that substring, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases where the string has a length of 1, resulting in an empty substring, where it implicitly returns `False`. Therefore, if `s` consists of only one character, or if 'z' is not found in the valid substring, the function will return `False`.
