The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string with a length of at least 1. It checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters. If 'z' is found in that substring, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases where the string has a length of 1, resulting in an empty substring, where it implicitly returns `False`. Therefore, if `s` consists of only one character, or if 'z' is not found in the valid substring, the function will return `False`.
