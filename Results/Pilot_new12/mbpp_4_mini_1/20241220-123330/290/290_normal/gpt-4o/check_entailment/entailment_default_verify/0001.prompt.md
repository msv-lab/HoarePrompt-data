You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle edge cases where the string may contain only 'z' at the start and/or end, or be very short. Here are some potential cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. The string "z" contains 'z' but doesn't satisfy the condition since it's at the start and end (the function should return False, but it would return False as expected).
2. The string "zz" contains 'z' at both start and end (the function should return False, but again it does return False as expected).
3. The string " a z " should return True as 'z' is in the middle, but strings with spaces can lead to an assumption of behavior which might need context.

However, one critical case is when 'z' appears directly after whitespace or some symbols. We must also consider the case of input such as "zabc" or "abc z" where the first character is 'z', which should yield False but gives True. 

Additionally, it does not check for empty strings, which was not explicitly covered. For instance:
- Input: "" should logically return False since there are no characters in the string.
  
Despite the checks, it fails to fully meet the problem description due to the reasons listed above.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string with a length of at least 1. It checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters. If 'z' is found in that substring, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases where the string has a length of 1, resulting in an empty substring, where it implicitly returns `False`. Therefore, if `s` consists of only one character, or if 'z' is not found in the valid substring, the function will return `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
