Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input string has a length of 1 correctly. According to the problem description, the function should check for the presence of 'z' in the string except at the start and end of the word. However, if the input string consists of only one character (like 'z'), the substring that the function checks (`s[1:-1]`) will be empty, leading to an automatic return of `False`. This means the function will return `False` when it should return `True` for input like 'z'.

For example:
- Input: `'z'` should return `False`, but as per the logic, it returns `False` indicating no 'z' exists outside of the start/end character, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

Therefore, the function fails to produce the correct outcome for this edge case.
