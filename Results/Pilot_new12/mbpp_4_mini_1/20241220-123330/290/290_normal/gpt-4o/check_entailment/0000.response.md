Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case of a string that contains 'z' at the start or end. For instance, the string `'zabc'` should return `False` because it contains 'z' at the start, yet the current implementation only checks if 'z' is between the first and last character. Therefore, it fails to check whether 'z' is excluded from the start or end of the string adequately. 

Additionally, the string `'abcxyz'` which has 'z' in it but does not satisfy the condition because it's placed at the end should return `False`, but it would return `True` using the current function implementation as it finds 'z' within the bounds of the string. 

Overall, the program does not adhere to the problem description fully.
