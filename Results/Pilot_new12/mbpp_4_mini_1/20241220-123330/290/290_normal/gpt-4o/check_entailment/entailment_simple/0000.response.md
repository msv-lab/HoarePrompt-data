To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the program logic and the assertions.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
   ```
   The function takes a single string `s` as input.

2. **Logic**:
   ```python
   if ('z' in s[1:-1]):
       return True
   return False
   ```
   - The slice `s[1:-1]` represents the substring of `s` that excludes the first character (`s[0]`) and the last character (`s[-1]`).
   - The condition checks if the character 'z' exists in this substring.
   - If 'z' is found, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Assertions:
- `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This checks for 'z' in the middle part of the string, which should return `True` - correct.
- `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: This checks that 'z' at the start does not count, which correctly returns `False` - correct.
- `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This checks for 'z' not being present at all, which correctly returns `False` - correct.

### Verification of Compliance with the Problem Description:
The program is consistent with the problem description because:
- It properly excludes the first and last characters while checking for the presence of 'z'.
- If 'z' is present in the substring formed by removing the first and last characters, the function declares that condition as satisfied by returning `True`.
- In all other cases (either 'z' is at the start or end, or it doesn't exist in the string), the function correctly returns `False`.

The program does not introduce any logic that could fail to fulfill the requirements given in the problem description under valid assumptions. It handles the inclusion and exclusion of 'z' according to the stated rules accurately.

### Conclusion:
Since the program behaves as expected for all specified cases in the problem description, the final evaluation of its correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
