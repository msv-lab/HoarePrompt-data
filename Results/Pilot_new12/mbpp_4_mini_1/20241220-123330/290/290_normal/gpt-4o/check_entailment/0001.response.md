Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle edge cases where the string may contain only 'z' at the start and/or end, or be very short. Here are some potential cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. The string "z" contains 'z' but doesn't satisfy the condition since it's at the start and end (the function should return False, but it would return False as expected).
2. The string "zz" contains 'z' at both start and end (the function should return False, but again it does return False as expected).
3. The string " a z " should return True as 'z' is in the middle, but strings with spaces can lead to an assumption of behavior which might need context.

However, one critical case is when 'z' appears directly after whitespace or some symbols. We must also consider the case of input such as "zabc" or "abc z" where the first character is 'z', which should yield False but gives True. 

Additionally, it does not check for empty strings, which was not explicitly covered. For instance:
- Input: "" should logically return False since there are no characters in the string.
  
Despite the checks, it fails to fully meet the problem description due to the reasons listed above.
