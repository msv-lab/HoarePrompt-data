Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The problem description states that the function should check if the string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

The function `func_1` only checks for the character 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the string. However, it fails to handle edge cases correctly:

1. If the input string has a length of 1 (e.g., 'z'), the function will check the substring `s[1:-1]`, which results in an empty string. In this scenario, the function will return `False`, which is incorrect because the single character 'z' is at the start and should indeed be excluded from being counted.

2. The comment after the function does not specify that the function does not handle strings of length 1, but it implicitly suggests this behavior. The correct behavior according to the problem description would involve returning `False` only if the input string starts or ends with 'z' and would not check the empty substring.

Therefore, there are scenarios (like single-character strings) where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, leading to incorrect conclusions.
