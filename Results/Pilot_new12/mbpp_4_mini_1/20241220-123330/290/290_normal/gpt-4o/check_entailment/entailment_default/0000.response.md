The provided function `func_1` checks whether the character 'z' is contained within a string, but it excludes the first and last characters of that string. The implementation seems to meet the basic requirement as outlined in the problem description. 

However, the Output hints point out a critical edge case: when the input string `s` consists of a single character. In this scenario, the substring `s[1:-1]` yields an empty string, and the function would indeed return `False`, as there can't be a 'z' in an empty string. However, the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle strings of length 1, which can lead to ambiguity regarding the expected behavior of the function under these conditions. 

To be more specific:
- For strings like `'z'`, the function correctly identifies that there is no 'z' except at the boundaries (as there are none), returning `False`, which aligns with the output hints.
- For strings of any length greater than 1 that do not have 'z' between the first and last characters, the function works correctly.

Nevertheless, because the problem description does not clarify how to handle a string of length 1, and given the potential for confusion about whether the absence of 'z' in such trivial cases should count as a 'false' match or if the function would ideally signal the presence of 'z' at the boundaries, we have to consider the function's performance across all potential input scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
