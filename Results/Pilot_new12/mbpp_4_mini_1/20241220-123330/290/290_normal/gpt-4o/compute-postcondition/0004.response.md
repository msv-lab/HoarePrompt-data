The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string with a length of at least 1. If 'z' is present in the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last characters, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present in that substring, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` and check for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters, returning `True` or `False` based on that check.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, a string of at least length 1, and returns `True` if 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding its first and last characters; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
