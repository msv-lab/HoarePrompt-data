The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words. It then checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in its substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a word that meets these criteria, the function returns `False`. The function only considers words with at least 2 characters for the presence of 'z', and it does not validate the input string for non-string types or check for empty strings. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input string contains non-space delimiters or punctuation.
