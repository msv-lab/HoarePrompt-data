#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, and no word in `words` has length greater than 1 with 'z' in the substring from the second to the second-to-last character.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words. It then checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in its substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a word that meets these criteria, the function returns `False`. The function only considers words with at least 2 characters for the presence of 'z', and it does not validate the input string for non-string types or check for empty strings. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input string contains non-space delimiters or punctuation.
