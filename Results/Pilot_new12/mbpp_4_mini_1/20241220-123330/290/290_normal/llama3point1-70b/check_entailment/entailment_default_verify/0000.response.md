Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the `func_1` program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The program successfully checks if any words in the input string contain the letter 'z', excluding the first and last characters of each word. 

The logic within the function operates as follows:
- It splits the input string into individual words.
- It checks each word to ensure it has a minimum length of 2, allowing for potential characters in both the second and second-to-last positions.
- It uses slicing (`word[1:-1]`) to check only the characters between the first and last of the word for the presence of 'z'.
- It appropriately returns `True` upon finding a valid occurrence and `False` if none are found after examining all words.

The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as intended under the specified conditions. While it is noted that the function does not validate input types or handle specific edge cases like punctuation, the assumption is made that input will always be valid based on the assessment criteria given. Thus, these factors do not detract from the overall correctness of the functionality described in the problem.
