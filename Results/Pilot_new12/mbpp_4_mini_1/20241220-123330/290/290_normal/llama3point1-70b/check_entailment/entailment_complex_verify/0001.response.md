Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fully satisfy the problem description. The function correctly checks if words contain 'z' within their internal characters, but it fails to appropriately handle edge cases, specifically with words that have 'z' at the start or end.

The problem description explicitly states to check for 'z' except at the start and end of the word. The program returns `True` under conditions that do not account adequately for cases where 'z' is located at the beginning or end of a word. For instance, the function would return `False` for input like `"zz"` or `"z apple"` when at least one boundary character is 'z', which is not correctly aligned with the specifications of the problem description.

In summary, while the program may return correct results for some cases, it is not robust in handling all specified scenarios per the problem description, confirming the original assessment's correctness.
