Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down how it meets those requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` accepts a string `s` as input.

2. **Splitting the String**: The string is split into words using `s.split()`, creating a list of words.

3. **Checking Each Word**: It iterates through each word in the list:
   - It checks if the length of the word is greater than 1, which ensures that there are characters in between the first and last characters to inspect.
   - It then checks if 'z' is present in the substring of the word excluding the first and last characters, specifically `word[1:-1]`.

4. **Return Conditions**: 
   - If 'z' is found in the specified substring, the function returns `True`, indicating that at least one word contains 'z' except at its start or end.
   - If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

This logic follows the given problem description accurately, checking for the presence of 'z' in the correct positions while adhering to the defined constraints. Thus, it effectively fulfills the requirements of the task.
