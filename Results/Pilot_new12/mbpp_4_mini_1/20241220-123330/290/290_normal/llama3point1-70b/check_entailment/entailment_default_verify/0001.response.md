Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies the shortcomings of the program based on the problem description. The assessment highlights that while the function can return correct results for certain cases (like `"apple z"`), it fails to properly check for instances where 'z' can appear as an internal character in words surrounded by other characters, particularly when input strings consist of single or multiple 'z's at the edges or isolated. 

The output hints further confirm the program's limitations by stating it only deals with words containing at least two characters and fails to validate input appropriately. For instance, the case of the string `"zz"` is correctly identified as a problematic edge case where the function erroneously returns `False`, but logically it should be evaluated to ignore the forbidden 'z's at the boundaries.

Thus, the function does not fully meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, and the nuances of certain edge cases are not handled correctly, leading to the final assessment remaining as **False**.
