Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program checks if a string contains the letter 'z' within words, but it fails in multiple potential cases. For example, if the input string contains punctuation or special characters that are not considered spaces, the word-splitting can be disrupted. Additionally, the checks performed are limited to words with more than one character. If the input string is a single character string that is 'z', the function will incorrectly return `False` as it does not check for that specific case. Furthermore, if there are multiple delimiters or if 'z' is at the beginning or end of a word with punctuation attached, the logic would not account for it properly either. Hence, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
