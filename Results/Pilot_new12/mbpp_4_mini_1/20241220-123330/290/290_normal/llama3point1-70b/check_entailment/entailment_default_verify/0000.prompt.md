You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if any words in the input string contain the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. 

Here's the logic breakdown:
- It splits the input string `s` into words using `s.split()`.
- For each word, it checks if the word length is greater than 1, ensuring that there is room for characters other than the first and last position.
- It checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring formed by `word[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the word.
- If it finds a 'z' in this range, it returns `True`.
- If it finishes checking all words without finding a 'z' in the specified positions, it returns `False`.

This logic correctly adheres to the problem description. I could not find any potential test cases where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words. It then checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in its substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a word that meets these criteria, the function returns `False`. The function only considers words with at least 2 characters for the presence of 'z', and it does not validate the input string for non-string types or check for empty strings. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input string contains non-space delimiters or punctuation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
