To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is supposed to check whether any given string contains 'z', except at the start and end of any words.

2. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False**, detailing that the program fails to correctly handle certain edge cases and thereby does not completely satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

3. **Annotations**: Let's analyze the annotated version provided:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string and splits it into words. 
   - The program checks every word that has a length greater than 1 for the presence of 'z' in its internal characters (between the first and last characters).
   - If 'z' is found in any word, it immediately returns `True`. If no such condition holds after iterating through all words, it returns `False`.

When assessing the original assessment against the logic provided in the annotations:
- The program indeed examines each word properly.
- The handling of single-character words and the specific treatment of 'z' at the start and end of words seems appropriate according to the logic described (it does not count 'z' in boundary positions).

However, despite the logical correctness in processing each word:
- The original assessment highlights critical cases. For an input like `"zz"`, where both characters are 'z', the requirement of the problem is to ensure there are no internal 'z's as defined by the boundaries being distinct from `z`. 
- Moreover, for phrases like `"z apple"`, the program returns `False`, which does align with the description, but the evaluation of multiple words with 'z' must also correctly clarify when they appear at the boundary versus the interior.

Based on the detailed examination of how the function checks for 'z', the identification of edge cases, and how the program might overlook scenarios where multiple occurrences of 'z' could conflict with the wording of the problem description, I will stick to the original assessment despite the annotations appearing to reaffirm some functional aspects.

Final: **False**
