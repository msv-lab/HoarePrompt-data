Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it meets the specified requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words using `s.split()`. This effectively handles whitespace-separated words, which aligns with typical expectations for string processing.

2. **Word Iteration and Checks**: The function then iterates over each word in the `words` list. For each word, it checks two conditions:
   - Whether the length of the word is greater than 1 (i.e., excluding single-character words).
   - Whether the letter 'z' appears in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character (`word[1:-1]`).

3. **Return Values**: If any word satisfies both conditions, the function returns `True`, indicating that a 'z' is present in the internal part of the word. If no such word is found after checking all the words, it correctly returns `False`.

4. **Compliance with Requirements**: The function explicitly checks for 'z' inside each word, ignoring the first and last characters as requested in the problem description. It ensures that only words with more than one character are considered, which prevents false positives from single-character words.

Since the function is correctly designed to check for the presence of 'z' only in the parts of the words that adhere to the stated requirements of the problem, it remains compliant and correct under all anticipated input conditions. The explanations in the provided comments further validate that it accurately represents its logic and intention.

Thus, the implementation fulfills the functional requirements of the problem description and is deemed correct.
