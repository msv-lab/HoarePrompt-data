Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` does not correctly fulfill the problem's requirement to check if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of any word. 

Here's a case where the program fails:
- Input: `"zebra"` should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the word.
- Input: `"az"`, should also return `False` because 'z' is at the end of the word.
- Input: `"hello z world"` should return `False` because there is no 'z' between the characters of any words.
- Input: `"hello zello"` should return `True` as `z` is present in `"zello"` but is not at the start or end.
However, the program will return `True` for such valid examples and will incorrectly identify cases that do not strictly satisfy the requirements set forth in the problem description.

In addition, the function does not handle words with punctuation or any non-space delimiters, which could lead to a misunderstanding of where 'z' is positioned within a word. Thus, because the program potentially misclassifies valid inputs, it is deemed incorrect overall.
