Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description in all cases. Specifically, it returns `True` if any word in the string contains 'z' in its internal characters (excluding the first and last characters). However, it fails to handle words that are a single character or words that consist solely of 'z'.

For example, consider the input `"z apple"`. According to the problem description, this should return `False` because there is a 'z' at the start of the word "z". Yet, since "apple" does not contain 'z', the program would return `False`, which is actually correct for this specific case.

However, for the input `"apple z"`, the program would also return `False` correctly.

Now take the input `"abc z def"`: The output is `False`, because 'z' is at the position 3 and 6 where z is not included as 'z' is at the end.

The critical case to note is when the input is `"zz"`. Here, it should return `False` since both 'z's are at the boundaries. But the program would still return `False` implicitly because there are no internal 'z's.

The primary flaw is with strings that contain both 'z' and characters that are not at the boundaries. The proper check should ensure that there are no 'z's present at all if they exist outside of the bounds but not strictly at the first or last character.

Thus, while the program handles basic cases well, there are several edge cases it does not cover completely based on the problem description. Therefore, it is not correctly implemented.
