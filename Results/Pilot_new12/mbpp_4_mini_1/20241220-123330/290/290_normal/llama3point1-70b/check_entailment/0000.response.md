Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if any words in the input string contain the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. 

Here's the logic breakdown:
- It splits the input string `s` into words using `s.split()`.
- For each word, it checks if the word length is greater than 1, ensuring that there is room for characters other than the first and last position.
- It checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring formed by `word[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the word.
- If it finds a 'z' in this range, it returns `True`.
- If it finishes checking all words without finding a 'z' in the specified positions, it returns `False`.

This logic correctly adheres to the problem description. I could not find any potential test cases where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified.
