You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description in all cases. Specifically, it returns `True` if any word in the string contains 'z' in its internal characters (excluding the first and last characters). However, it fails to handle words that are a single character or words that consist solely of 'z'.

For example, consider the input `"z apple"`. According to the problem description, this should return `False` because there is a 'z' at the start of the word "z". Yet, since "apple" does not contain 'z', the program would return `False`, which is actually correct for this specific case.

However, for the input `"apple z"`, the program would also return `False` correctly.

Now take the input `"abc z def"`: The output is `False`, because 'z' is at the position 3 and 6 where z is not included as 'z' is at the end.

The critical case to note is when the input is `"zz"`. Here, it should return `False` since both 'z's are at the boundaries. But the program would still return `False` implicitly because there are no internal 'z's.

The primary flaw is with strings that contain both 'z' and characters that are not at the boundaries. The proper check should ensure that there are no 'z's present at all if they exist outside of the bounds but not strictly at the first or last character.

Thus, while the program handles basic cases well, there are several edge cases it does not cover completely based on the problem description. Therefore, it is not correctly implemented.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, and no word in `words` has length greater than 1 with 'z' in the substring from the second to the second-to-last character.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words. It then checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' in its substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding a word that meets these criteria, the function returns `False`. The function only considers words with at least 2 characters for the presence of 'z', and it does not validate the input string for non-string types or check for empty strings. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input string contains non-space delimiters or punctuation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
