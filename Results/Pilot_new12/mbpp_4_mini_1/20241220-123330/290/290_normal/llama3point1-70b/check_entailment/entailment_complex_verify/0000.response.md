The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **True**, which is based on the claim that the function `func_1` checks if any words in the input string contain the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. The annotations provided further support this claim by detailing the behavior of the function.

The annotated version confirms that:
1. The variable `s` is indeed a string prior to the function’s operations.
2. The words are split correctly using `s.split()`, resulting in a list of words in `words`.
3. Each word is evaluated for length and the presence of 'z' in the permitted range (from the second to the second-to-last character).
4. If a word fulfilling the criteria is found, the function correctly returns `True`, and if no such words exist, it returns `False`.

The additional notes in the annotations clarify that the function does not check for non-string types or handle special cases such as punctuation or empty strings, but given the assumption that valid input will always be provided, these factors do not detract from the correctness of the program.

Overall, the assessment aligns with the functionality described in the problem statement — the function efficiently checks for the presence of 'z' in the required positions without returning incorrect outcomes.

After evaluating all of the above, it leads us to conclude that the program meets the problem description adequately, and the original assessment stands correct.

Final: **True**
