`words` is assigned the result of `s.split()`, which splits the string `s` into a list of words based on whitespace. The state of `s` is not affected directly, but `words` now contains a list representation of its contents. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, and `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`.**
