According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. For the loop to execute, `words` must contain at least one word. At the end of the last iteration, `word` will represent the last element in the `words` list. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments are needed:
- The string `s` needs to be such that when split, it results in at least one word in `words`.
- The variable `word` will take on the value of the first element in the `words` list during the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string that must contain at least one word, `words` is a list of words that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**.
