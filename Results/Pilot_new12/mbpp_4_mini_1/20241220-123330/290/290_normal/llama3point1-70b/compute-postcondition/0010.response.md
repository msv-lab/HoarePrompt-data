Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that contains at least one word, `words` is a list of at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in the list. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is found in the substring of `word` from the second to the second-to-last character, the program returns True; otherwise, it returns None.***
