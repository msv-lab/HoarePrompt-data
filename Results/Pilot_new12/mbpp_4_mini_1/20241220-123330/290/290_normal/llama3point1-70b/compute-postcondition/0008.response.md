According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `words` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must contain at least three words. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the second word in the list, which corresponds to index 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, the `word` will need to be the third word in the list. This means we will also increment the index.

Since there must be at least three words in the list for the loop to execute once more, the states should reflect that condition.

State: **`s` is a string that contains at least one word, `words` is a list of at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in the list.**
