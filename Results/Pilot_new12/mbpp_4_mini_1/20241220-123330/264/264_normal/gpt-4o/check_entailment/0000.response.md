Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly handle cases involving negative degrees or values greater than or equal to 360 degrees, which are valid angle measures. For example:

- **Input**: -90 degrees.
- **Expected Output**: -1.5707963267948966 (since -90 degrees is equivalent to -Ï€/2 radians).
- **Actual Output**: The code correctly computes it, but it should also be explicitly checked.

Additionally, for values above 360 (e.g., 450 degrees), the output will be incorrect, as the function should apply modular arithmetic to convert angles greater than 360 degrees to their equivalent angles within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

- **Input**: 450 degrees.
- **Expected Output**: 7.853981633974483 (which is equivalent to 90 degrees in radians).
- **Actual Output**: It calculates without checking for equivalence, thus potentially giving incorrect outputs.

Hence, the function does not account for all possible edge cases that could arise from both negative and greater-than-360 degree inputs, leading to an overall incorrect assessment of correctness.
