You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the value of degrees converted to radians by multiplying degrees by (math.pi / 180)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single numeric parameter `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees. It converts this angle into radians by multiplying it by the mathematical constant Ï€ (math.pi) divided by 180. The function returns the resulting value in radians. It does not perform any input validation, so it assumes that the input is a valid numeric type. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as unsupported data types (e.g., strings, lists) or special numeric values (e.g., NaN, infinity), which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if such values are passed. Hence, while the function effectively performs the conversion for typical numeric values, it lacks robustness in handling all possible inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
