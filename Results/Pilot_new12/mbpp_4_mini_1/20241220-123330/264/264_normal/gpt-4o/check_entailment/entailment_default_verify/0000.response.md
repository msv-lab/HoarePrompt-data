Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle cases involving negative degrees or angles greater than 360 degrees, which are valid inputs for angle measures. The function calculates radians based solely on the formula provided, without accounting for the cyclical nature of angles or the potential for negative inputs. As per the output hints, the function assumes that all inputs are valid numeric types but fails to validate or convert inputs that fall outside the standard range. Therefore, the reasoning in the original assessment remains valid, and the program does not meet the expectations set forth in the problem description regarding its handling of all potential edge cases.
