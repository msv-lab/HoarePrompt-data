Correctness: **False**

The provided program lacks the implementation of the function `func_1` before the assertions that test it. This means that when the assertions are executed, the function `func_1` has not been defined yet, leading to a `NameError`. Consequently, the code will not run successfully as intended.

A specific case where the program fails is the first assertion: `assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`. This will result in an error because `func_1` is not defined at the time of the assertion checks. 

Therefore, since the program cannot handle even the first input due to the order of operations (function definition after its usage), the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.
