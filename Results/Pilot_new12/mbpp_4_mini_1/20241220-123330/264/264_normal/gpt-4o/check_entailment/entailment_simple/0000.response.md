Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to convert degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(degrees)` takes a numeric input `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees.

2. **Conversion Logic**: Inside the function, the conversion from degrees to radians is performed using the formula:
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
   \]
   This is the standard mathematical conversion between degrees and radians, and the implementation directly reflects this formula.

3. **Test Cases**: The three assertions provided test the function with valid degree inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees) and compare the output to known values of radians (1.5707963267948966, 1.0471975511965976, and 2.0943951023931953 respectively). The successful execution of these assertions indicates that the function produces the correct output for these cases.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the specified functionality for converting degrees to radians, it is concluded that it is correct.
