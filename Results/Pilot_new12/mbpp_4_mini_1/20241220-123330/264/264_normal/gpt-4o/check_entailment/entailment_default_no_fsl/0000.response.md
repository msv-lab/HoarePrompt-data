Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle cases involving unsupported data types such as strings, lists, or special numeric values like NaN and infinity. While it correctly converts valid numeric inputs from degrees to radians, there are no checks to ensure that the input is indeed a numeric type. This could lead to runtime errors if the input is not validated. For example, if the function is called with a string input (e.g., `func_1("90")`), it will raise a `TypeError`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for "every potential case" as specified in the problem description.
