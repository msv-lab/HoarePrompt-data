Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all valid edge cases concerning degrees, specifically negative values and values greater than or equal to 360 degrees. While the function `func_1` performs correctly for some typical inputs (as demonstrated by the assertions), it lacks the necessary checks and adjustments for converting angles outside the standard [0, 360) range effectively. 

According to the reasoning provided in the original assessment, if angles like -90 degrees or 450 degrees are input, the program does not yield the expected radian values due to the absence of modular arithmetic or checks for negative angles. Thus, the function may produce incorrect outputs, which directly contradicts the requirement of the problem description to convert degrees to radians for any valid angle measure. Since these deficiencies are not addressed, the final assessment of the program's correctness must remain **False**.
