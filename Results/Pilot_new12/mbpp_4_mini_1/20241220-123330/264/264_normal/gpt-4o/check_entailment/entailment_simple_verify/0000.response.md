Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not account for all valid angle measures. While it correctly converts positive angles, it lacks handling for negative degrees and angles greater than or equal to 360 degrees. Specifically, it should return the appropriate equivalent radians for these cases, which it currently does not check for. The annotations also do not address this issue, supporting the original conclusion that the function is not fully correct according to the problem description.
