Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` is defined after the assertions that test it. As a result, when the assertions are executed, `func_1` has not yet been defined, leading to a `NameError` during runtime. This fundamental structural issue prevents the program from running as intended, even though the logic within the function itself correctly converts degrees to radians when it is defined. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description, which is to function correctly for provided inputs. The output hints do indicate some potential limitations regarding input validation, but the critical flaw is the order of execution in the code.
