Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

1. The function `func_1` accepts a single numeric parameter, `degrees`, which is expected to represent an angle in degrees.
2. It correctly performs the conversion by multiplying the value of `degrees` by the factor \( \frac{\pi}{180} \), which is the standard mathematical conversion from degrees to radians.
3. The assertions following the function definition test the function against known values:
   - For 90 degrees, the function correctly returns \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or approximately 1.570796327).
   - For 60 degrees, it returns \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) (approximately 1.047197551).
   - For 120 degrees, it returns \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \) (approximately 2.094395102).
4. The function returns the correct value for these test cases, which suggests that it works accurately for typical numeric inputs representing degrees.

Though the function does not include input validation and does not handle edge cases such as special numeric values, it is stated in the directive that we assume valid input will always be provided. Therefore, under this assumption, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

In conclusion, since the implementation correctly converts degrees to radians and fulfills the problem's requirements for the provided inputs, the program is deemed correct.
