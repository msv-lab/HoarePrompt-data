The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to the function `func_1` being defined after its usage in assertions, leading to a `NameError`. The annotated version, however, also contains these assertions before the function definition and provides an explanation of how `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians.

While it is crucial for a program to be defined in a way that adheres to the order of operations, the purpose of evaluating correctness also considers the function's ability to perform its intended task. The function `func_1` indeed accomplishes the degrees to radians conversion as required by the problem description. The issue arises solely from the improper placement of function definitions relative to their calls.

Given that the program isn't organized properly but the logic of the function itself is correct, we can conclude that while the program will not run successfully due to the order of definitions, when the function is executed correctly after its definition, it would fulfill the problem's requirement when called properly.

However, since the program as presented cannot be executed successfully without modification, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate based on the overall functionality of the code as it is currently written.

Final: **False**
