Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: While the function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians for valid numeric input, it does not handle edge cases such as unsupported data types (e.g., strings, lists) or special numeric values (e.g., NaN, infinity). The output hints indicate that the function assumes valid numeric input, but it lacks input validation. If a user passes in a string or a list, the function will raise a runtime error instead of handling the input gracefully, which means it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
