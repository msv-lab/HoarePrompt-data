Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies a critical flaw in the program: the function `func_1` is defined after its assertions, leading to a `NameError` at runtime. Regardless of the subsequent correctness of the function's implementation (which correctly converts degrees to radians), the program cannot execute successfully due to the order of operations. Since the program does not perform correctly as specified in the problem description, the conclusion remains that the program is incorrect.
