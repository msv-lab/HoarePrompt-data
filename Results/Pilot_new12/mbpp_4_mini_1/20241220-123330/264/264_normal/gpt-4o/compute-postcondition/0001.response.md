The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `degrees`. `degrees` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `degrees` converted to radians by multiplying `degrees` by (math.pi / 180). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a numeric value `degrees` representing an angle in degrees and return its equivalent value in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter degrees, representing an angle in degrees, and returns its equivalent value in radians.**
