The function `func_1` accepts a single numeric parameter `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees. It converts this angle into radians by multiplying it by the mathematical constant Ï€ (math.pi) divided by 180. The function returns the resulting value in radians. It does not perform any input validation, so it assumes that the input is a valid numeric type. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as unsupported data types (e.g., strings, lists) or special numeric values (e.g., NaN, infinity), which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if such values are passed. Hence, while the function effectively performs the conversion for typical numeric values, it lacks robustness in handling all possible inputs.
