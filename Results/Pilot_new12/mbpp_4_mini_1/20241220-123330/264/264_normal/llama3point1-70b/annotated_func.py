#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns deg multiplied by (π/180), where deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `deg` by (π/180). There are no checks for the validity of the input, meaning that if `deg` is not numeric or is a valid numeric representation (like a float or int), the function may raise an error. The function does not handle edge cases where `deg` is non-numeric, nor does it account for any potential data types that could lead to exceptions during the calculation.
