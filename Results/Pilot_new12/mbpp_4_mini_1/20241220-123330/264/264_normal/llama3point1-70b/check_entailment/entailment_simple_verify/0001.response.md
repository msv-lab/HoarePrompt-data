Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for converting degrees to radians, which is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The problem description aligns with the functionality of the program, and the annotated version confirms that the variable `deg` is correctly understood as a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. All necessary edge cases are inherently covered by the formula itself, including zero and negative angles. The annotations support that the return value is a valid computation for any numerical input given, reaffirming the correctness of the program.
