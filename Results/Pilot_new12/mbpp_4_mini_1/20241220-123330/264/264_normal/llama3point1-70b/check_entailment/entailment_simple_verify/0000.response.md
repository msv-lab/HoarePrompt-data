Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly states that the function accurately converts degrees to radians using the mathematical formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotation regarding the program's state before the function call supports this assessment by clarifying that the input `deg` is a numeric value, which aligns with the functional expectation of the conversion. There are no unhandled cases or edge conditions in the specified context of the problem description, which assumes valid input. Thus, both the original assessment and the annotations reinforce the correctness of the program.
