Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the function correctly converts degrees to radians using the standard formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \), which is correct according to the problem description. The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by clearly stating that the function takes a numeric input representing degrees and returns the equivalent in radians.

Although the annotations acknowledge that there are no checks for the validity of the input, they also clarify that we are assuming valid input as per the problem's constraints. The program correctly performs the conversion for valid numeric inputs (both positive and negative).

Thus, based on the provided annotations and the original assessment's reasoning, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, I maintain that the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate.
