Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program correctly converts degrees to radians and accommodates all edge cases. However, the output hints reveal that the function does not handle non-numeric input and may raise an error if `deg` is not a valid number. This indicates that the program is not robust as it does not account for potential input types that could lead to exceptions. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description, which implies that a correct conversion should not only be accurate for numeric input but also well-defined in terms of handling various input scenarios. Thus, the original assessment is inaccurate, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect as it does not handle all relevant edge cases.
