Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement from the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes an input parameter `deg`, which is expected to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. It correctly performs the conversion to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. This is the standard mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, so the computation is accurate.

2. **Return value**: The function returns the converted value, which fulfills the requirement of returning the equivalent angle in radians.

3. **Assumptions about input**: The problem description and the annotations acknowledge that input is assumed to be valid (a numeric value). Given this assumption, the function should work correctly in all intended scenarios.

Although the function does not include error handling for non-numeric inputs, this is acceptable under the stated assumptions that the input provided will always be valid. Therefore, within the context provided, the function aligns with the described problem.

Thus, the program does what the problem description asks for every potential case that aligns with the defined assumptions.
