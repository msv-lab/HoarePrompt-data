Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). However, it does not handle edge cases where the input `deg` is non-numeric, such as strings (`'45'`, `'abc'`), lists, or any other data types. If the function is called with such values, it will raise an error (TypeError or ValueError), which means it does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Thus, it fails to fulfill the problem's description as it does not consider invalid inputs.
