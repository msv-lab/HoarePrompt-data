Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the function correctly converts degrees to radians and works for any valid input. However, the output hints highlight that the function does not handle non-numeric input and can potentially raise an error if an invalid type is passed. This indicates a gap in error handling that could lead to failures under certain conditions, such as passing a string or a non-numeric type, contrary to the assertion that it works for any input. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description's implied requirement for robustness regarding input types.
