Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate for all input values, including both positive and negative angles as well as zero. The use of the `math.pi` constant ensures precision in the conversion.

Since the logic implemented accommodates all edge cases (like 0 degrees, negative degrees, and very large values), there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the description. Therefore, the program works as expected for any valid input.
