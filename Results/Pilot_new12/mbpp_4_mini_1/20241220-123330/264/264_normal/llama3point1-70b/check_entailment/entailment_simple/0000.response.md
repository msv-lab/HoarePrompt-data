Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input `deg`, which is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees, and applies the formula to convert this angle into radians. The conversion is mathematically accurate, as it uses the relationship that radians = degrees × (π/180).

1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: The formula for converting from degrees to radians is correctly applied in the return statement: `deg * math.pi / 180`.

2. **Input Assumption**: The problem description assumes that the input will be valid (a numeric value), and the program adheres to this by performing the calculation without any checks for input type or range. Since we are operating under the assumption that valid input will always be provided, the program will always execute as intended.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and will always convert degrees to radians correctly for any numeric degree input.
