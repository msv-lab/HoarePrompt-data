Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program accurately converts degrees to radians using the appropriate mathematical formula. According to the problem description, the function is expected to convert degrees to radians, which the program does. The annotations also confirm that the function operates under the assumption of valid numeric input and performs the necessary calculation without error.

Although the annotations mention the lack of input validation, we have a specific assumption that valid input will always be provided, which means that the absence of error handling does not detract from the correctness of the program within the defined constraints. Therefore, since the program correctly implements the conversion as described without any contradictions in the annotated states, the conclusion that the program is correct remains valid.
