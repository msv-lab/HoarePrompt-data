Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` is supposed to convert degrees to radians as stated in the problem description. While the formula for the conversion is correct, the function does not handle potential issues with input types. The output hints indicate that there are no checks for the validity of the input and it may raise an error if `deg` is not numeric (e.g., a string or None). 

For instance, calling `func_1("90")` would raise a TypeError, which goes against the expectation that the function should handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Therefore, while the conversion logic is accurate for valid numeric inputs, the lack of input validation means the function does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.
