The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, it returns `deg` multiplied by (π/180). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a numeric value `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees, and return its equivalent in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying deg by (π/180).**
