Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `deg` by (Ï€/180). There are no checks for the validity of the input, meaning that if `deg` is not numeric or is a valid numeric representation (like a float or int), the function may raise an error. The function does not handle edge cases where `deg` is non-numeric, nor does it account for any potential data types that could lead to exceptions during the calculation.**
