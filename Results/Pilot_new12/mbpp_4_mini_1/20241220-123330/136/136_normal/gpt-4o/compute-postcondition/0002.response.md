Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, returning a new dictionary that contains only the key-value pairs from `d` where the associated value is greater than or equal to `n`. If there are no values in `d` that meet this condition, the function will return an empty dictionary. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`; it creates and returns a new dictionary based on the filtering criteria.**
