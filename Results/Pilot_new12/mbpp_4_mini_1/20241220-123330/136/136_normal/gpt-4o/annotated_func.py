#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with values that are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 'd' where the value is greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, returning a new dictionary that contains only the key-value pairs from `d` where the associated value is greater than or equal to `n`. If there are no values in `d` that meet this condition, the function will return an empty dictionary. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`; it creates and returns a new dictionary based on the filtering criteria.
