Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements described in the problem statement. The program utilizes a dictionary comprehension to filter the input dictionary `d` based on the values compared to the integer `n`. The assertions provided demonstrate the function's expected behavior, outputting the correct filtered dictionaries for various test cases, including those that represent edge cases.

The annotated version clarifies the state of the input parameters right before the function call, reaffirming that `d` is a dictionary with integer values and `n` is an integer, which aligns with the assumptions of valid input. The annotation about the returned output confirms that it includes only the key-value pairs where the value meets the cutoff defined by `n`. Given that all of these points support the correctness described in the original assessment, I conclude that the program is indeed correct and meets the specifications outlined in the problem description.
