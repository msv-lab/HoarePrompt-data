Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out entries whose values are less than `n`. 

All of the test cases provided demonstrate that the function `func_1` correctly produces the expected output: 

1. For the input with `n = 170`, the function returns the entries where values are greater than or equal to 170, which matches the expected result.
2. For `n = 180`, it correctly filters to include only entries with values of 180 or more.
3. For `n = 190`, it returns just the entry with the value of 190.

Additionally, the filtering logic `(v >= n)` handles all possible cases correctly. 

Since after considering various scenarios and test inputs there are no instances found that show the program fails to operate according to the specifications, the implementation is indeed correct.
