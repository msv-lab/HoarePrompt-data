Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary based on the given integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to construct a new dictionary that only includes key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for various test cases, and it appears to handle edge cases properly, such as when all values are below `n` or when `n` is equal to a value present in the dictionary. Given that all inputs in the assertions are met correctly, no issues with edge cases are apparent. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct, and it satisfies the requirements described in the problem statement.
