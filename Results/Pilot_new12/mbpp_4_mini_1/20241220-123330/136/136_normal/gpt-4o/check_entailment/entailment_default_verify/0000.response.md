Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It successfully filters the input dictionary based on the provided integer `n`, returning only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The given assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected across various scenarios, including cases where no entries meet the criteria (which would return an empty dictionary). The output hints further validate this by stating that the function does not modify the original dictionary and handles the filtering appropriately. Since all these points align with the problem description, the conclusion of correctness remains justified.
