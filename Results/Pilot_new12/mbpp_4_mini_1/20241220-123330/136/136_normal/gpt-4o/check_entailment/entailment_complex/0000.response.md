Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two inputs: a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`. It filters this dictionary to include only those entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The output of the function is a new dictionary consisting of key-value pairs from `d` that satisfy this condition. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which specifies that the function should filter the dictionary based on the value threshold `n`.

Additionally, the assertions provided in the annotated program test various scenarios to ensure the function performs correctly. They confirm that the function returns the expected filtered dictionaries based on different values of `n`, including cases where no entries meet the criteria. Since all assertions hold true, we conclude that the function operates correctly across all potential cases as described.

In summary, the function does exactly what the problem description requires: it filters out entries in the dictionary based on the specified integer threshold, returning only the relevant key-value pairs without modifying the original dictionary.
