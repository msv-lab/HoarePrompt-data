Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description, which specifies the need to create a function that filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion as it confirms that the function constructs a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values meet the specified criteria.

The assertions provided in the original program effectively demonstrate that the function behaves as intended across multiple test cases, yielding the expected results. The annotations validate the correctness of the function, clarifying its purpose and how it processes the input to produce the correct output.

Overall, the original assessment stating that the program is correct aligns with the evidence provided in the problem description, the program implementation, and the annotations. Thus, I conclude that the function operates correctly under the specified requirements.
