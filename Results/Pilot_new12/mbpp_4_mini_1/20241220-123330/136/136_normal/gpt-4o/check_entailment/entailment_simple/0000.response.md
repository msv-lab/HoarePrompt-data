Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1(d, n)` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that only includes entries from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. It uses a dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` to iterate through all key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`.
2. It applies the condition `if v >= n`, which filters out any entries where the value is less than `n`.
3. As a result, the function returns only those entries which satisfy the condition, thus fulfilling the requirement to filter the dictionary based on the integer `n`.

The assertions provided in the annotated program also test various scenarios, confirming the function behaves as expected for different values of `n`. Each assertion checks if the output of `func_1` matches the expected filtered dictionary.

Given all these points, the program accurately implements the filtering functionality as required by the problem description.
