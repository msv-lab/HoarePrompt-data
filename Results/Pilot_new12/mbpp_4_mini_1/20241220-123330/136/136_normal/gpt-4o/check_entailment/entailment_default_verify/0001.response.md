Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` filters a dictionary based on the provided integer `n`, returning only those entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The test cases confirm that the function produces the expected results, and the output hints support the behavior described. The function does not modify the original dictionary and handles the specified input correctly, which aligns with the requirements stated. Hence, the overall evaluation leads to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
