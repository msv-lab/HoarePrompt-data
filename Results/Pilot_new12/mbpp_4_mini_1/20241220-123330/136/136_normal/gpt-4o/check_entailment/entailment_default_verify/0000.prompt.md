You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170) == {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 180) == {'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 190) == {'Pierre Cox': 190}

def func_1(d: dict, n: int) -> dict:
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary based on the given integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to construct a new dictionary that only includes key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for various test cases, and it appears to handle edge cases properly, such as when all values are below `n` or when `n` is equal to a value present in the dictionary. Given that all inputs in the assertions are met correctly, no issues with edge cases are apparent. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct, and it satisfies the requirements described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, returning a new dictionary that contains only the key-value pairs from `d` where the associated value is greater than or equal to `n`. If there are no values in `d` that meet this condition, the function will return an empty dictionary. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d`; it creates and returns a new dictionary based on the filtering criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
