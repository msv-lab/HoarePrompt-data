Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the filtering of the dictionary based on the given integer `n`. It accurately returns a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, as specified in the problem description. 

The output hints confirm that the function should return an empty dictionary if no entries meet the specified criteria, which is also covered in the implementation. The assertions provided as examples in the program demonstrate that it functions correctly under various scenarios. Since there are no edge cases or missing logic identified based on the output hints and assertions, I conclude that the program meets all requirements of the problem description.
