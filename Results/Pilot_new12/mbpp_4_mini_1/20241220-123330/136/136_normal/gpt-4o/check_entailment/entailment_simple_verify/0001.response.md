Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The annotated code supports this, providing a clear indication that the program behaves as expected before the function call and confirms the correctness of the return value based on the provided test cases.

All annotations demonstrate that the function produces the expected output for varying inputs, thus validating the filtering logic. Given these evaluations, the function operates correctly in accordance with the problem statement's requirements, and there are no inconsistencies or errors noted in the annotations.
