Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly states that the program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` accurately implements the requested filtering behavior, adhering to the defined specifications. The annotated version further confirms this by clarifying that the function returns key-value pairs from the input dictionary where the values are greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. 

The assertions that test the function show that the function behaves as expected with the given inputs, producing the correct filtered dictionary as outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, the combination of the problem description, the analysis from the original assessment, and the supporting details in the annotated code all reinforce the conclusion that the program is functioning correctly.
