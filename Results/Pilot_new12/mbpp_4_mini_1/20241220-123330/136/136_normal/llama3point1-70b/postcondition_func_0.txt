The function accepts a dictionary `d` that contains comparable values (such as integers or floats) and a parameter `n`, which is also a number (integer or float). It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` for which the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a number or where the values in `d` are not comparable. It also doesn't modify the original dictionary `d`.
