Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter the dictionary `d` such that it only includes entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

The annotations confirm that the function is designed to create a new dictionary specifically based on the described filtering condition. They clearly outline that the function handles an empty dictionary correctly by returning an empty dictionary and states that it does not modify the original dictionary `d`, which is also appropriate as per the problem statement.

Given the assumptions that the inputs will always be valid (i.e., `d` will be a dictionary with comparable values and `n` will be a number), the program's behavior aligns perfectly with the expectations set forth in the problem description. It has been established that the logic used within the function is sound and follows Pythonic practices with dictionary comprehensions.

Thus, the overall assessment remains valid, confirming the function's correctness.
