The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic is sound and adheres to the problem description. The function successfully filters the input dictionary based on the specified criteria of retaining only those entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. 

The annotations confirm this by explicitly stating the expectations before and after the function call. They highlight that the input is a valid dictionary with comparable values, and the function returns a new dictionary composed of the requisite key-value pairs. It also addresses various scenarios, such as handling empty dictionaries and cases where some or all values meet the threshold, all of which align with the problem description.

Given this alignment between the problem description, the implementation, and the scenario checks provided in the annotations, the conclusions drawn in the original assessment remain valid.

Final: **True**
