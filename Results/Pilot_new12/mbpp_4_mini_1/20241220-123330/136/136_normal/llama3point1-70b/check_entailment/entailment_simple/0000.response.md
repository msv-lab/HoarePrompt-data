Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specified criteria:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer (or float) `n` as inputs, which aligns with the problem description requirements. 

2. **Filtering Logic**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary `d`. It selects only those entries where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Output**: The program returns a new dictionary that contains only the entries that satisfy the filtering condition (i.e., values greater than or equal to `n`). This fulfills the requirement to filter the dictionary based on the given integer `n`.

Since the program successfully meets all aspects of the problem description by filtering the entries appropriately based on their values, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
