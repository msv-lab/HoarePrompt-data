Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, then creates a new dictionary containing only the entries from `d` whose values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension, which is a valid and efficient way to filter items based on a condition. The logic `if v >= n` correctly captures the requirement to include only those entries whose values satisfy the condition.

I cannot think of a case where this function would not work based on the outlined requirements, as it handles different scenarios, including:

1. If `d` is empty, it will return an empty dictionary, which is correct.
2. If all values in `d` are less than `n`, it will also return an empty dictionary, again aligning with expectations.
3. If `n` is less than or equal to all values in `d`, it will include all items, which is also correct.

Thus, the program behaves as specified for all potential cases.
