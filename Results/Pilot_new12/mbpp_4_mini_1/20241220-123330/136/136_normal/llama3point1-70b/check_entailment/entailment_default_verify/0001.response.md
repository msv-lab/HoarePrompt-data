Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude as follows:

The program `func_1` indeed fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, returning a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The implementation correctly uses dictionary comprehension to achieve this.

The original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** is also supported by the reasoning that:
- It correctly returns an empty dictionary when `d` is empty.
- It appropriately returns an empty dictionary when all values in `d` are less than `n`.
- It includes all items when `n` is less than or equal to all values.

However, the output hints point out that while the function fulfills the primary functionality described, it does not handle cases where `n` is not a number or where the values in `d` are not comparable. That said, the problem description does not outline any requirements or constraints regarding invalid inputs. The assumption that input will always be valid means that the hint about the function not handling these cases does not impact its correctness within the parameters that have been established.

Given these considerations, I maintain that the function correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, and the input constraints align with the overall expectations. Thus, the original assessment remains valid.

Final: **True**
