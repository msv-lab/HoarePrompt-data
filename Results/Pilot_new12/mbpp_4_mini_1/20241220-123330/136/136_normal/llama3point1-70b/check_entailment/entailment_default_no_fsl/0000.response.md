Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as indicated in the output hints. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where `n` is not a number or where the values in the dictionary `d` are not comparable. 

For instance, if `d` contains values of mixed types (e.g., a string and a number) or if `n` is a string, the comparison `v >= n` may result in a `TypeError` or an incorrect filtering logic. As per the problem description, the function is supposed to manage a dictionary with comparable valuesâ€”this is not guaranteed with the current implementation.

Thus, since the code does not work correctly in these highlighted cases, the program is incorrect.
