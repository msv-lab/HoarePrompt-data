Explanation: The code appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description. The function creates a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension that includes only those key-value pairs from the input dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints suggest that it returns an empty dictionary if the input dictionary is empty, which matches the function's behavior. Furthermore, while the hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `n` or the dictionary values are not numbers, the assumption is that valid input will always be provided according to the problem constraints. Thus, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs as defined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
