Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a dictionary `d` and an integer (or float) `n`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. It filters the dictionary based on the condition that the values in the dictionary must be greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The use of a dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` effectively creates a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the values satisfy the condition (`v >= n`). This matches exactly what is described in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function also accounts for the scenario where `d` is empty by returning an empty dictionary, which is compliant with the expected behavior. Given the assumption that inputs will always be valid (no errors due to bad input types), this behavior is acceptable according to the problem requirements.

4. **No Modifications to Original Dictionary**: The function does not alter the original dictionary `d` but instead creates and returns a new filtered dictionary, which is also in line with the problem description.

Overall, since the function correctly implements the filtering logic as specified and adheres to the stated conditions, it is correct.
