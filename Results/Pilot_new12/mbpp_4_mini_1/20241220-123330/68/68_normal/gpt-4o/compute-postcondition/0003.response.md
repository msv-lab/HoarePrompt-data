Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which can be either floats or integers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these two parameters and calculates its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The function returns the phase angle as a float. There are no explicit checks for invalid input types; any non-numeric input would raise an error. It does not handle cases where the inputs are `None` or non-numeric types, potentially leading to runtime exceptions.**
