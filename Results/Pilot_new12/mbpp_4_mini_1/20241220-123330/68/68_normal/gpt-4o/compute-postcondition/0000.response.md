The value of `complex_number` is assigned the complex number created from the `real` and `imag` parts, which are floats or integers. The `complex` function will create a complex number where the real part is `real` and the imaginary part is `imag`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are floats or integers, `complex_number` is a complex number created from `real` and `imag`.**
