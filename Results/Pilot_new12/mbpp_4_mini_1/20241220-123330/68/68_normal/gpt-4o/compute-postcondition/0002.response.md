The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` can be either floats or integers, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase angle of the complex number created from the provided `real` and `imag` values using the `cmath.phase` function. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two parameters, `real` and `imag`, and return the phase angle of the complex number formed by these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters real and imag, which are floats or integers, and returns the phase angle of the complex number created from these parts.**
