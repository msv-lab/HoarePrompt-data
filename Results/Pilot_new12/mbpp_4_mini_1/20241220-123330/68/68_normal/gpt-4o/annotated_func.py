#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floats or integers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle of the complex number created from 'real' and 'imag' using the cmath.phase function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which can be either floats or integers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these two parameters and calculates its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The function returns the phase angle as a float. There are no explicit checks for invalid input types; any non-numeric input would raise an error. It does not handle cases where the inputs are `None` or non-numeric types, potentially leading to runtime exceptions.
