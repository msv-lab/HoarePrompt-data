To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description (to get the angle of a complex number), we need to analyze both the program itself and the provided test cases.

The program defines a function `func_1(real, imag)` that takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Inside the function, it constructs a complex number using the built-in `complex` function and calculates its phase (angle) using `cmath.phase`.

The supplied assertions attempt to test this functionality, checking if the returned values match expected angles for certain complex numbers. The angles checked are:
1. The angle of \(0 + 1j\) which should be \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5707963267948966\).
2. The angle of \(2 + 1j\) which should be \(\tan^{-1}(0.5) \approx 0.4636476090008061\).
3. The angle of \(0 + 2j\) which should also be \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5707963267948966\).

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and if the function fails for any:

1. **Zero Input**: If both parts are zero (i.e., \(0 + 0j\)), the function does not handle this input clearly. The angle of zero would be undefined, and `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which is misleading according to the intended definition of angle for complex numbers.
   
2. **Negative Imaginary Input**: There are no tests for complex numbers with a negative imaginary part, such as \(1 - 1j\). The angle for this would be in the fourth quadrant.

3. **Very Large Numbers**: The assertions do not test very large or very small values of real and imaginary parts which could bring floating-point precision issues depending on context.

Since an edge case is identified where the function does not explicitly address the case of both parts being zero (which is a valid input but leads to an undefined angle), we conclude that the implementation is not correct for every potential case outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
