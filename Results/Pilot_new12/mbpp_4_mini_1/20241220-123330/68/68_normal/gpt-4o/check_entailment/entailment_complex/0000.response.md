Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function must return the angle (phase) of a complex number constructed from the given real and imaginary parts. 

Hereâ€™s how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Function Definition:** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. These can be either floats or integers, as stated in the annotations.

2. **Complex Number Creation:** The function constructs a complex number using the built-in `complex()` function, which correctly takes the `real` and `imag` parameters.

3. **Phase Angle Calculation:** The function employs `cmath.phase()` to compute the angle (or phase) of the constructed complex number. The `cmath.phase()` function correctly returns the phase angle in radians, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Assertions:** There are multiple assertions provided that test specific cases of the function, ensuring it returns the correct phase angle for the given complex numbers. Each assertion compares the output of `func_1` for various inputs against known expected outputs within a small tolerance, confirming that the function behaves correctly for those cases.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input:** The annotations note that the function does not handle invalid input types, but per the problem description's assumptions, it is acceptable to assume valid inputs will be provided. Therefore, this does not detract from the function's correctness.

In summary, the program accurately implements the task described in the problem statement, consistently returning the correct phase angle of the complex number formed by the provided real and imaginary parts. Thus, it is deemed correct.
