Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires calculating the angle (or phase) of a complex number represented by its real and imaginary parts.

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(real, imag)` is defined to accept two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
2. Inside the function, a complex number is created using the built-in `complex(real, imag)` constructor. This correctly represents the complex number from the provided components.
3. The function then uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to compute the phase angle of the complex number. The `cmath.phase` function returns the angle in radians, which is precisely what the problem description calls for.
4. The assertions following the function definition validate that the function produces the expected results for various test cases of complex numbers, demonstrating that the implementation is working correctly.

Since the program correctly calculates the angle of any complex number given its real and imaginary parts, it accurately follows the specifications outlined in the problem description.
