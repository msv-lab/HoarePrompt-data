The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. The program defines such a function (`func_1`) that correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to return the angle of a complex number representable in the standard form \( a + bi \).

The original assessment raised valid concerns, particularly regarding edge cases:
1. The case when both inputs are zero is a significant issue since the angle for this is undefined. The `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which is misleading.
2. The assessment also noted the absence of tests for negative imaginary parts and the need for various checks surrounding floating-point precision.

However, the annotations confirm that the function calculates the angle as expected for the provided test cases. They also indicate that `real` and `imag` are appropriately defined as floats or integers representing the complex number's parts, showing that the function operates correctly under normal conditions.

Considering the assumption mentioned in the prompt—valid input will always be given—while the program does indeed fail when provided with \(0 + 0j\), it might still be deemed acceptable if it is assumed such a case won't arise. 

In light of this reasoning, since no further context is provided that contradicts the function's behavior for acceptable inputs and the function correctly computes angles for the tested cases, I would maintain the original assessment but confirm its conclusion based on these assumptions and analyses.

Final: **False**
