Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the inputs are `None` or non-numeric types, which could lead to runtime exceptions. Although the program works correctly for the provided numeric inputs and returns the expected phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function, it fails to address potential edge cases where the inputs may not be valid numbers. Examples such as passing `None`, strings, or other non-numeric types would cause the program to raise errors, hence not satisfying the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate this limitation clearly.
