Correctness: **False**.

The program correctly defines a function to calculate the angle (or phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. However, there is an issue in the placement of the assertions for testing the `func_1` function. Specifically, the assertions are placed before the function's definition. As a result, when the program is run, it will not recognize `func_1` at the time the assertions are executed, leading to a `NameError`.

An example where the program fails is if you attempt to run the code as is. It will raise an exception before verifying any cases, meaning it does not handle the situation properly. Therefore, while `func_1` appears to work correctly, the placement of the assertions makes the overall program incorrect.
