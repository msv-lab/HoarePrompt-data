Based on the problem description, the function is supposed to calculate and return the angle (or phase) of a complex number derived from the input real and imaginary parts. The function `func_1` utilizes the `cmath.phase` function correctly for this purpose.

However, the program contains a significant issue regarding the placement of assertions that check the function's correctness. These assertions are placed before the function definition, which means when they are executed, the function `func_1` does not exist in the current scope yet, resulting in a `NameError`. The original assessment accurately states that this design flaw would prevent the code from running successfully. 

The annotated version reiterates this issue, as the assertions are immediately at the top, referencing a function that hasn't been defined yet. Therefore, although `func_1` is correctly implemented, the overall design does not allow for its successful execution due to the error in the order of operations.

Thus, after reviewing the function behavior, the original assessment is deemed accurate. The program does not function correctly in its current form because it raises an error before any computation can take place.

Final: **False**
