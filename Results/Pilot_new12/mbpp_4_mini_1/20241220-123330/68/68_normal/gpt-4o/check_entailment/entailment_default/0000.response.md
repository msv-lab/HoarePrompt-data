The program provided follows the problem description of calculating the angle (phase) of a complex number. The function `func_1` constructs a complex number using the `complex` function from the `real` and `imag` parameters, and then it retrieves the phase of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The output hints indicate that the function does not handle invalid input types, such as `None` or non-numeric types, and would raise an error in those cases. However, it is stated that we should assume valid input will be provided, so checking for non-numeric types or handling `None` is not necessary within the context of this problem.

The test cases given as assertions show that the program correctly computes the expected angles for the provided complex numbers, and there are no instances indicated where the function fails with the valid input it is designed to handle.

Therefore, in every case covered by the problem description, the function behaves correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
