You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description (to get the angle of a complex number), we need to analyze both the program itself and the provided test cases.

The program defines a function `func_1(real, imag)` that takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Inside the function, it constructs a complex number using the built-in `complex` function and calculates its phase (angle) using `cmath.phase`.

The supplied assertions attempt to test this functionality, checking if the returned values match expected angles for certain complex numbers. The angles checked are:
1. The angle of \(0 + 1j\) which should be \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5707963267948966\).
2. The angle of \(2 + 1j\) which should be \(\tan^{-1}(0.5) \approx 0.4636476090008061\).
3. The angle of \(0 + 2j\) which should also be \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5707963267948966\).

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and if the function fails for any:

1. **Zero Input**: If both parts are zero (i.e., \(0 + 0j\)), the function does not handle this input clearly. The angle of zero would be undefined, and `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which is misleading according to the intended definition of angle for complex numbers.
   
2. **Negative Imaginary Input**: There are no tests for complex numbers with a negative imaginary part, such as \(1 - 1j\). The angle for this would be in the fourth quadrant.

3. **Very Large Numbers**: The assertions do not test very large or very small values of real and imaginary parts which could bring floating-point precision issues depending on context.

Since an edge case is identified where the function does not explicitly address the case of both parts being zero (which is a valid input but leads to an undefined angle), we conclude that the implementation is not correct for every potential case outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which can be either floats or integers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these two parameters and calculates its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The function returns the phase angle as a float. There are no explicit checks for invalid input types; any non-numeric input would raise an error. It does not handle cases where the inputs are `None` or non-numeric types, potentially leading to runtime exceptions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
