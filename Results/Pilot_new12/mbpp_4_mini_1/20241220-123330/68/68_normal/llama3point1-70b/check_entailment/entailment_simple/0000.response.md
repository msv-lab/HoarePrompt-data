Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description, which is to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The problem description does not specify any restrictions or special cases for the inputs, and it is assumed that valid floating-point numbers are provided.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Within the function, the program constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex` function with the provided real and imaginary parts. This is in line with the goal of dealing with complex numbers.

3. **Computing the Angle**: The program uses `cmath.phase` to compute the angle (or phase) of the complex number created. The angle is correctly calculated and returned. This aligns perfectly with the task described in the problem statement.

Since all steps in the program directly fulfill the requirements of the problem description without any errors or unnecessary conditions, the program is deemed correct.
