Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and computes the angle (or phase) using `cmath.phase`. The annotations confirm that the inputs are valid floating-point numbers, which is consistent with the assumption of valid input throughout the program's execution.

The examples provided in the original assessment are supported by the logic in the code and the expected outcomes:

1. For `func_1(1, 0)`, the computed angle of the complex number `1 + 0j` is indeed `0` radians, as stated.
2. The calculation for `func_1(0, 1)` resulting in an angle of `π/2` radians is also correctly handled according to the behavior of `cmath.phase`.
3. Inputting negative values like `func_1(-1, 0)` yielding `π` radians aligns with expected mathematical principles governing complex numbers.
4. The edge case of `func_1(0, 0)` returning `0` is a standard convention in programming.

Overall, the program meets the expectations set by the problem description and behaves correctly across various scenarios, confirming the original assessment’s correctness. Thus, the final conclusion is that the function works as intended.
