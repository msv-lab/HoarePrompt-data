Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the angle (also known as the phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. By constructing a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts, it handles all possible cases appropriately. 

Here are some examples that confirm its correctness:

1. If you input `func_1(1, 0)`, it represents the complex number `1 + 0j`, and the angle is `0` radians, which is correctly returned.
2. For `func_1(0, 1)`, the complex number is `0 + 1j`, and the angle should be `π/2` radians (or `90 degrees`), which is also handled correctly.
3. Inputting negative values like `func_1(-1, 0)` returns `π` radians, representing an angle of 180 degrees, correctly calculated.
4. Even for edge cases like `func_1(0, 0)`, while mathematically the angle is undefined, the code will return 0, and it is a common convention.

Since all potential cases work as expected and yield the correct angle for any complex number represented by the given real and imaginary parts, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hence, it is correct for all conceivable input scenarios.
