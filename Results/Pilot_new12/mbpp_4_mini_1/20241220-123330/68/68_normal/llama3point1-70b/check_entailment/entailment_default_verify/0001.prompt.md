You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the angle (also known as the phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. By constructing a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts, it handles all possible cases appropriately. 

Here are some examples that confirm its correctness:

1. If you input `func_1(1, 0)`, it represents the complex number `1 + 0j`, and the angle is `0` radians, which is correctly returned.
2. For `func_1(0, 1)`, the complex number is `0 + 1j`, and the angle should be `π/2` radians (or `90 degrees`), which is also handled correctly.
3. Inputting negative values like `func_1(-1, 0)` returns `π` radians, representing an angle of 180 degrees, correctly calculated.
4. Even for edge cases like `func_1(0, 0)`, while mathematically the angle is undefined, the code will return 0, and it is a common convention.

Since all potential cases work as expected and yield the correct angle for any complex number represented by the given real and imaginary parts, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hence, it is correct for all conceivable input scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number, which is a floating-point value representing the angle in radians with respect to the positive real axis. The phase is computed using `cmath.phase()`, ensuring that the function properly handles all input values, including edge cases where the real or imaginary parts are zero. The function does not handle any specific errors or exceptional cases, such as non-numeric inputs; however, it does work correctly for all valid floating-point numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
