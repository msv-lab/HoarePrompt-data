Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. It defines a function, `func_1`, which accepts two floating-point numbers (`real` and `imag`) representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes two parameters of type floating-point, which aligns with the requirement to represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: The code constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex()` function, combining the `real` and `imag` parts. This is an appropriate way to represent a complex number in Python.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase()` to compute the phase of the complex number, which corresponds to the angle of the complex number in radians concerning the positive real axis. This is exactly what is required by the problem statement: to obtain the angle of a complex number.

4. **Output**: The function returns the phase angle as a floating-point value, which appropriately represents the angle in radians. 

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The annotations on the code note that the function handles a variety of inputs validly since the `cmath.phase()` function can accommodate edge cases, including when the real or imaginary parts are zero.

Overall, every aspect of the implementation aligns with the problem description requirements, ensuring that it performs the intended operation correctly under valid input conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as true.
