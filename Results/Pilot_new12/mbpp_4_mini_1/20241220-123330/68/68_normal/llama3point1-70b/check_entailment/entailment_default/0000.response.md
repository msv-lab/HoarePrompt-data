Explanation: The code looks correct according to the problem description. It constructs a complex number from the provided real and imaginary parts, and then it returns the phase (or angle) of that complex number in radians using `cmath.phase()`. The output hints confirm that the function is designed to handle all input values including edge cases, such as when either the real or imaginary part is zero. Since the function is based on the built-in `cmath` library, it correctly calculates the angle for all valid floating-point inputs. No specific error handling is required for the types of inputs described in the problem, thus the program functions as intended across all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
