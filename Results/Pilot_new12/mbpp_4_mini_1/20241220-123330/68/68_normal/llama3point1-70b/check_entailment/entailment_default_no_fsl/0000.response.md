Correctness: **False**

The function is designed to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number provided by its real and imaginary parts. While the function correctly computes the phase for valid floating-point inputs, it does not handle non-numeric inputs. 

An example of a case where the function would not work correctly is if the inputs are non-numeric, such as strings or other data types. For instance, calling `func_1("1", "2")` would result in a TypeError, which indicates that the function does not adequately handle all potential cases per the problem description. Therefore, despite the function working correctly for valid floating-point inputs, the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs makes the program incorrect.
