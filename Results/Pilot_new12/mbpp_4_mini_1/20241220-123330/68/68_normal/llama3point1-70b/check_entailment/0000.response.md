Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the calculation of the angle (or phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. It creates a complex number from the given real and imaginary parts and then returns the phase of that complex number. 

The phase is calculated correctly for all possible inputs, including:
1. Positive real and imaginary parts.
2. Negative real and imaginary parts.
3. Zero for either part (e.g., when the complex number is purely real or purely imaginary).
4. Cases where both parts are zero would return a phase of 0, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Thus, since the code performs as intended for all potential cases, the correctness is verified as **True**.
