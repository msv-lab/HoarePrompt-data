The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number formed by `real` + `imag`j. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and return its phase. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase of that complex number.**
