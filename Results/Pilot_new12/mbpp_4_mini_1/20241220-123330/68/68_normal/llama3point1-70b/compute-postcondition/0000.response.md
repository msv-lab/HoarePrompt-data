The variable `complex_num` is assigned the value of the complex number created from `real` and `imag`. Since both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers, `complex_num` will be a complex number with its real part as the value of `real` and its imaginary part as the value of `imag`. The values of `real` and `imag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is a complex number with the form `real` + `imag`j.**
