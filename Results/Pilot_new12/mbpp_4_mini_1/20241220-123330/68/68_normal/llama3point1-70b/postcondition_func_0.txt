The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number, which is a floating-point value representing the angle in radians with respect to the positive real axis. The phase is computed using `cmath.phase()`, ensuring that the function properly handles all input values, including edge cases where the real or imaginary parts are zero. The function does not handle any specific errors or exceptional cases, such as non-numeric inputs; however, it does work correctly for all valid floating-point numbers.
