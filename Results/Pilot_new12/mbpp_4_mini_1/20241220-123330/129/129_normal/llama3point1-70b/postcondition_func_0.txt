The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value as an integer using the `ord()` function. It is important to note that the function assumes the input will be a valid single character string; if the input does not meet this criterion (for instance, if it is an empty string or longer than one character), the function will raise an error (specifically, a `TypeError` or `ValueError`). Thus, while the function is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character, it does not handle input validation or any edge cases related to invalid input.
