Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character using the `ord()` function. However, the output hints indicate that the function assumes the input will always be a valid single character string. If the input is an empty string or a string longer than one character, the function will raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`. This means that it does not handle input validation properly or cover edge cases (such as an empty string or multiple characters). Since it does not guarantee correct functionality for all potential inputs as stated in the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
