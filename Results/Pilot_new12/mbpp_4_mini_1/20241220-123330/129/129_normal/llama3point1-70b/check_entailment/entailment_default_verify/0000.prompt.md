You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function. It adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer.

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:
- The description asks for a function that returns the ASCII value of a character.
- The function `func_1` accepts a single character as a string argument, which is aligned with the problem requirements.
- The `ord()` function is correctly utilized to convert the character to its ASCII value.

All potential cases, including valid single characters and special characters, will return appropriate ASCII values without any issues. Therefore, the program works as intended in all described scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value as an integer using the `ord()` function. It is important to note that the function assumes the input will be a valid single character string; if the input does not meet this criterion (for instance, if it is an empty string or longer than one character), the function will raise an error (specifically, a `TypeError` or `ValueError`). Thus, while the function is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character, it does not handle input validation or any edge cases related to invalid input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
