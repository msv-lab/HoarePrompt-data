Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input `char` is not a single character. According to the problem description, it specifies that the function should operate on a single character. However, there are no checks in the code to ensure that the input is exactly one character long. If a user provides an empty string, a string with more than one character, or any non-string input, the function would still attempt to compute the ASCII value, potentially leading to incorrect results or an unexpected behavior.

For example:
- Input: `""` (an empty string) will raise a `TypeError`.
- Input: `"ab"` (more than one character) will return the ASCII value of the first character only, which does not meet the requirement of handling a single character correctly.

Therefore, the function does not meet the specification for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
