Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the problem description, which requires a function to find the ASCII value of a single character. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Assumption**: The function `func_1` is defined with the understanding that the input `char` is a string of length 1, representing a single character. The problem description specifies that we are to find the ASCII value of a character, which aligns with this input assumption.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses the built-in `ord()` function, which correctly returns the ASCII value of a character. Thus, it effectively implements the requirements stated in the problem description.

3. **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the ASCII value of the input character. This matches the expected output type outlined in the problem description.

Since all requirements of the problem description are met without any exceptions or undefined behavior under the assumption of valid input, the program is correct.
