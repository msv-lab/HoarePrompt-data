Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character. However, it does not handle input validation for cases when the input is not a valid single character string, such as an empty string or a string longer than one character. According to the output hints, if the input does not meet the requirement of being a single character, the function will raise errors like `TypeError` or `ValueError`. Therefore, it does not comply with the problem description for every potential case, as the description implies that the expected input should always be valid, and the function should handle or validate incorrect inputs gracefully. 

For instance, calling `func_1('')` or `func_1('ab')` will not return the expected ASCII values but instead raise an error. This violates the expectation set by the problem description that the function should correctly return ASCII values for valid single character inputs only.
