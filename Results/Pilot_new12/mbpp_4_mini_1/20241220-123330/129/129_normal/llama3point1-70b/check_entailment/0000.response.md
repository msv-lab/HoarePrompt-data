Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function. It adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer.

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:
- The description asks for a function that returns the ASCII value of a character.
- The function `func_1` accepts a single character as a string argument, which is aligned with the problem requirements.
- The `ord()` function is correctly utilized to convert the character to its ASCII value.

All potential cases, including valid single characters and special characters, will return appropriate ASCII values without any issues. Therefore, the program works as intended in all described scenarios.
