Correctness: **True**

The annotated program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is defined to return the ASCII value of a single character, which is exactly what the problem description states.
  
2. **Parameter Type**: The function takes a parameter `char`, which is explicitly stated to be a string of length 1 representing a single character. This conforms to the requirement as the ASCII value can only be derived from a single character.

3. **Correct Return Value**: The function uses `ord(char)` to retrieve the ASCII value of the character. The `ord` function is the correct method to obtain the ASCII value, which ensures that the function behaves as specified.

4. **Assumption on Input Validity**: The annotations clarify that the input is assumed to be validâ€”a single character string. The problem description does not require handling for invalid inputs, and since the task specifies that we should assume the user will provide valid input, the function correctly adheres to the requirements.

Given these points, the program fulfills the functionality described in the problem statement, fulfilling its intended purpose correctly and efficiently without any extraneous behaviors or errors. Therefore, it is deemed correct.
