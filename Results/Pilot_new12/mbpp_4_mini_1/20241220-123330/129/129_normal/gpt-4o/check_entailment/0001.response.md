Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The use of the `ord()` function in Python correctly retrieves the ASCII value for the given character input. Additionally, the provided test cases verify that the function works for uppercase letters 'A', 'R', and 'S', returning the expected values.

Furthermore, testing a wider range of inputs, including lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, would yield the appropriate ASCII values, affirming the correctness of the function:

- For example, `func_1('a')` returns 97, `func_1('0')` returns 48, and `func_1('!')` returns 33, all of which are correct according to the ASCII table.

Since no potential case illustrates a failure of the program to meet the specified requirements, the implementation can be determined to be robust and correct in all expected scenarios.
