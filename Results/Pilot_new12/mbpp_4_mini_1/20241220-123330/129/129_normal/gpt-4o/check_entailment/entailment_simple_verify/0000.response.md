Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character, and the annotated version of the code confirms that the input is expected to be a single character string. The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `ord()` function to correctly return the ASCII value of the input character, and the assertions verify that it produces the expected results for the provided examples. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, there are no additional issues that need addressing, reinforcing the correctness of the implementation.
