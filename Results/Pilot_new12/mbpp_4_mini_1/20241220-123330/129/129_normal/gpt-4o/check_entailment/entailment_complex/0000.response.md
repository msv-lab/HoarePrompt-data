Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description by defining a function `func_1` that takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided validate that the function works correctly for specific test cases ('A', 'R', and 'S'), demonstrating that when valid single-character strings are passed, the function accurately returns the expected ASCII values.

The explanation in the annotations indicates an understanding of how the function operates and the expected input type, which aligns with the problem description. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (a single character string), any potential errors due to incorrect input types or edge cases do not affect the correctness of the program, as per the given assumptions.

Thus, the function operates correctly according to the problem description.
