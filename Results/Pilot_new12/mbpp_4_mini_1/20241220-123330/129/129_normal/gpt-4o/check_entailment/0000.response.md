Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function in Python. The assertions provided are examples that confirm the function returns the expected ASCII values for characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the `ord()` function handles all valid single character inputs, and there are no edge cases that lead to incorrect output (e.g., passing non-string types, empty characters, or multiple characters), the implementation is correct as per the problem description.
