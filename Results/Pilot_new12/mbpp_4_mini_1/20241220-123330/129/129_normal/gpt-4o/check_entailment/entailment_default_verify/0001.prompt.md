You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The use of the `ord()` function in Python correctly retrieves the ASCII value for the given character input. Additionally, the provided test cases verify that the function works for uppercase letters 'A', 'R', and 'S', returning the expected values.

Furthermore, testing a wider range of inputs, including lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, would yield the appropriate ASCII values, affirming the correctness of the function:

- For example, `func_1('a')` returns 97, `func_1('0')` returns 48, and `func_1('!')` returns 33, all of which are correct according to the ASCII table.

Since no potential case illustrates a failure of the program to meet the specified requirements, the implementation can be determined to be robust and correct in all expected scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `char`, which is expected to be a single character string, and returns the ASCII value of that character using the `ord()` function. If the input `char` is not a single character string (e.g., it is an empty string or a string with more than one character), the behavior may lead to unpredictable results or an error. Consequently, the function effectively returns an integer representing the ASCII value for valid inputs. Edge cases such as non-string input or unexpected types are not handled, which may result in runtime exceptions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
