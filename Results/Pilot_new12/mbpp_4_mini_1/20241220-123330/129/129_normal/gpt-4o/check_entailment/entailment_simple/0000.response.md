Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(char)` takes a single character string as input.
2. It utilizes the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character.
3. The assertions provided check the output of the function against known ASCII values, verifying that the function behaves as expected for those inputs.

Since the function processes valid input (a single character string) and accurately returns the corresponding ASCII value, it fulfills the problem description's requirements. Therefore, it is correct under the assumption that inputs will always be valid.
