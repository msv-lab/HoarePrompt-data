Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` is indeed designed to return the ASCII value of a single character string as specified in the problem description. The use of the `ord()` function is appropriate and effectively retrieves the correct ASCII values for valid inputs, as evidenced by the provided assertions.

The annotations clarify that the function behavior is predicated on receiving a single character string. While the annotations note that edge cases such as empty strings or strings longer than one character are not handled, the problem description assumes valid input, which means we can consider the function correct within those constraints. The provided assertions confirm that for the specified inputs ('A', 'R', 'S'), the function returns the expected results.

Thus, the function meets the problem's requirements and, despite the mentioned caveats in the annotations, these do not detract from the overall correctness regarding valid character inputs.
