#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `char`, which is expected to be a single character string, and returns the ASCII value of that character using the `ord()` function. If the input `char` is not a single character string (e.g., it is an empty string or a string with more than one character), the behavior may lead to unpredictable results or an error. Consequently, the function effectively returns an integer representing the ASCII value for valid inputs. Edge cases such as non-string input or unexpected types are not handled, which may result in runtime exceptions.
