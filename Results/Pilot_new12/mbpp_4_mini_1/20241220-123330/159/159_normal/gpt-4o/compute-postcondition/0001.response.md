The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers. After executing the function body, it returns one-third of the product of math.pi, the square of `radius`, and `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative float or integer parameters `radius` and `height`, and return one-third of the volume of a cylinder using those dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both non-negative floats or integers, and returns one-third of the product of math.pi, radius squared, and height.**
