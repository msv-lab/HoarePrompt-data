The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. 

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `radius` and `height`, both of which are assumed to be non-negative floats or integers, as stated in the program's comment.
2. It returns the volume of the cone using the aforementioned formula.
3. The program includes assertions that check if the function yields the expected volume for given values of `radius` and `height`.

### Assertions:
- The assertions validate the output of `func_1` against known correct values for different radius and height inputs, which further reinforces the correctness of the function:
  - For a radius of 5 and height of 12, the expected volume is approximately 314.159.
  - For a radius of 10 and height of 15, the expected volume is approximately 1570.796.
  - For a radius of 19 and height of 17, the expected volume is approximately 6426.651.

Since the function consistently calculates the volume of a cone as per the problem description and handles valid inputs correctly without any errors for the expected input types, it meets the requirements set forth.

Therefore, the evaluated correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **True**
