Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone as \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, it does not handle potential cases where the inputs could be negative, which is against the implicit assumption of both inputs being non-negative. If the function were to receive negative values for `radius` or `height`, it would produce incorrect results, such as a negative volume or incorrect mathematical scenarios (as a volume cannot be negative or calculated with negative dimensions). Since we need the program to follow the problem description for every potential case, and it fails to consider these edge cases, the correctness is marked as false.
