Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to find the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), and the provided program does correctly implement this formula.

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` calculates the cone's volume based on the provided parameters `radius` and `height`. The assertions verify that the function produces expected output values within a reasonable tolerance for the specified input cases, which are positive numbers. 

The annotations state that the program assumes `radius` and `height` are non-negative, which aligns with the expectation of valid inputs. Since the validation of inputs is assumed to be the user's responsibility (the program does not handle negative or non-numeric inputs), the program can still be considered correct within the defined context of accepting valid input values.

Therefore, while the original assessment noted that the function does not handle negative values, it is also supported by the annotations' clarification that the function is designed assuming input will be valid and within the stated parameters.

Given all of this, I reaffirm that the original assessment is accurate but needs to acknowledge the context of valid input assumptions.

Final: **True**
