Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input values for `radius` and `height` are negative or non-numeric. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to find the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, the output hints indicate that there is no input validation or error handling present in the function. Consequently, if negative values or non-numeric types are passed to `func_1`, it will lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors. For example, if `func_1(-5, 12)` is called, it would perform a calculation with a negative radius, which does not make sense in the context of finding a physical volume.

Thus, since the function does not operate correctly for all potential input cases as required by the problem description, it is incorrect.
