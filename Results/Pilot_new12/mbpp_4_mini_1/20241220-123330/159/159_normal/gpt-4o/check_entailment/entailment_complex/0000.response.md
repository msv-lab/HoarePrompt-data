Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly implements a function to calculate the volume of a cone using the specified formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). 

1. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both expected to be non-negative floats or integers. It computes the volume using the correct mathematical formula for the volume of a cone.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with specific values (radius and height) and check the output against the expected volume for a cone of those dimensions using `math.isclose`, allowing for minor floating-point inaccuracies. The expected results for the given inputs are accurate, confirming the function works as required.

3. **Assumption of Input Validity**: The program assumes that the inputs are always valid (non-negative), as noted in the annotations. Therefore, as long as this assumption holds true, the function will always compute the correct volume as per the problem description.

Overall, since the implementation adheres to the mathematical definition of a cone's volume and correctly utilizes the inputs as per the specifications, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
