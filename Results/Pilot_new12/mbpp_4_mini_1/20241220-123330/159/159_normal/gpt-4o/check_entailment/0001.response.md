To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description**: The task is to find the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone given its radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

**Program Analysis**: The function `func_1` is implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

This implementation correctly calculates the volume of a cone according to the formula. The function takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume using the correct mathematical formula.

Next, the assertions provided check for correctness with specific values:

1. `func_1(5, 12)` should return approximately `314.159...`
2. `func_1(10, 15)` should return approximately `1570.796...`
3. `func_1(19, 17)` should return approximately `6426.651...`

All of these checks use `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance, which is appropriate for comparing floating-point results.

**Edge Cases Consideration**: 

- Negative values for `radius` or `height` will produce incorrect results since dimensions of a cone (like any geometric volume) cannot be negative. There is no error checking for negative inputs in the function.
  
- Zero values for `radius` or `height` are valid inputs in geometric terms and should return a volume of zero.

To check if the program handles negative values, consider:

- `func_1(-5, 12)` which would yield a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful.
- `func_1(5, -12)` which would also yield a negative volume.

Both cases lead to an incorrect interpretation of the geometric concept.

Given this analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases defined by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle negative inputs for `radius` or `height`, which leads to invalid calculations for the volume of a cone. For example, `func_1(-5, 12)` does not produce a meaningful result.
