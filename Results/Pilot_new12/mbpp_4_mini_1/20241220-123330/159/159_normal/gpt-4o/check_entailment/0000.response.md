Correctness: **False**.

The provided program computes the volume of a cone based on the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, the function does not handle edge cases where the radius or the height are negative, which are physically invalid inputs for the volume calculation. For example, if we call `func_1(-5, 12)`, the program will still return a volume but it does not make sense in the context of a physical cone, leading to an incorrect result. 

Additionally, the program does not appropriately deal with the case where either the radius or height is zero, returning a volume of zero, which is correct but should be acknowledged in terms of its context (it represents a degenerate cone).

Thus, the program is incomplete and incorrect as it does not handle these potential cases.
