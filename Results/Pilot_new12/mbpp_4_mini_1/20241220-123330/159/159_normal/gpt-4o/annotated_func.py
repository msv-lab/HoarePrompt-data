#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius is a non-negative float or integer, and height is a non-negative float or integer.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns one-third of the product of math.pi, radius squared, and height, where radius is a non-negative float or integer and height is a non-negative float or integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which must be non-negative floats or integers. It computes the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \) where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function returns this calculated volume. It does not handle cases where the inputs may be negative or non-numeric, which could lead to potential errors during execution. However, as per the annotations, it appropriately doesnâ€™t account for the possibility of input validation or error handling, assuming inputs will always meet the stated criteria.
