The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which must be non-negative floats or integers. It computes the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \) where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function returns this calculated volume. It does not handle cases where the inputs may be negative or non-numeric, which could lead to potential errors during execution. However, as per the annotations, it appropriately doesnâ€™t account for the possibility of input validation or error handling, assuming inputs will always meet the stated criteria.
