The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers representing the dimensions of a cone. After executing the function body, it calculates the volume of the cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height and returns this volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the non-negative dimensions of a cone (radius and height) and return the calculated volume of the cone.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, which are non-negative floats or integers, and returns the volume of the cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
