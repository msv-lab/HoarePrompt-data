Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, which is \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The annotations explicitly confirm that:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to compute the volume using valid input parameters `radius` and `height`.
2. Both parameters are stated as non-negative floats or integers. 
3. The formula used within the function accurately reflects the mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone.

Since the program handles valid inputs as specified and produces correct outputs according to the problem description, the original assessment of correctness as **True** is supported by both the program's logic and its annotations. Thus, the refined assessment confirms the overall correctness of the program.
