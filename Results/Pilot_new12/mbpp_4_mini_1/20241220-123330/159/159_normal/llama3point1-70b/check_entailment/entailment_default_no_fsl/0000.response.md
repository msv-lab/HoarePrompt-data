Correctness: **False**

The program claims to calculate the volume of a cone using the formula \((1/3) \cdot Ï€ \cdot radius^2 \cdot height\). However, it does not implement any input validation to ensure that the parameters `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. 

For instance, if either `radius` or `height` is negative or non-numeric, the function will not behave as expected and may raise a runtime error. Since the output hints point out these lack of validation and its potential consequences, it shows that the program fails to cover every potential case as described in the problem statement. Thus, it does not meet the requirements in a robust manner.
