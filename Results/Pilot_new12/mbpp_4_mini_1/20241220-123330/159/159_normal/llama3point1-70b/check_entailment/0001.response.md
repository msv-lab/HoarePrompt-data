Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height of the cone.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of potential cases:

1. **Positive Radius and Height**: For any positive values of radius and height, the function will return a valid volume.
   - Example: `func_1(3, 5)` should return \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (3^2)(5) = 15\pi \), which is a valid positive volume.

2. **Zero Radius or Height**: When either the radius or height is zero, the volume should be zero.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 5)` and `func_1(3, 0)` both return \( 0 \), which is correct as a cone with zero dimensions has no volume.

3. **Negative Values**: While a physical cone cannot have negative dimensions, the mathematical function does not specifically prohibit negative input, and it will still compute a volume.
   - Example: `func_1(-3, 5)` will return a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful but is mathematically computed correctly based on the formula.
   - The function does not handle negative values in terms of input validation, which could be considered a limitation.

Despite the potential limitation regarding negative inputs, the program accurately follows the formula of volume calculation for valid (including edge cases like 0) cone dimensions, indicating correctness for the described task. Therefore, I conclude that there are no failure cases that violate the stated problem description.
