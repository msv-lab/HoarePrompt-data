Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to calculate the volume of a cone based on the given formula: \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the cone and \( h \) is the height. The annotation specifies that both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers, which aligns with the assumptions stated in the problem description. Since the function utilizes the `math.pi` constant to provide an accurate value of \( \pi \) and correctly computes the volume, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description. The input will be valid and within the expected constraints, ensuring the function will always return the correct volume of the cone for the provided inputs. Thus, the program is correct.
