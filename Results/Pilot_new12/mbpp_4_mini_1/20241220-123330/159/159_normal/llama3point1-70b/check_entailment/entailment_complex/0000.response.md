Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone using the formula provided in the problem description: \( \text{volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative floats or integers, in line with the requirements of the problem.

The annotations clearly state the expected types for the input parameters and confirm that the function returns the correct volume using the appropriate mathematical formula. While there is a note about the function's lack of input validation, the problem description assumes valid input, so this aspect does not affect the correctness of the function in fulfilling the requirements as outlined.

Therefore, since the program correctly computes the volume as requested in the problem description, we conclude that it meets the specified requirements.
