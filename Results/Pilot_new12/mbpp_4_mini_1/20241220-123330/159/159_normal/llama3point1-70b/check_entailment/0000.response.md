Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, which is \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). It takes in `radius` and `height` as parameters, performs the calculation using those parameters, and uses the `math.pi` for an accurate value of \( \pi \). There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail for valid non-negative parameters, and it handles positive values for radius and height correctly, producing a valid volume output.
