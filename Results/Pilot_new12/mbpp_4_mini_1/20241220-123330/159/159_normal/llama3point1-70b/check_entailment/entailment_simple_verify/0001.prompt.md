You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height of the cone.

Here’s a breakdown of potential cases:

1. **Positive Radius and Height**: For any positive values of radius and height, the function will return a valid volume.
   - Example: `func_1(3, 5)` should return \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (3^2)(5) = 15\pi \), which is a valid positive volume.

2. **Zero Radius or Height**: When either the radius or height is zero, the volume should be zero.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 5)` and `func_1(3, 0)` both return \( 0 \), which is correct as a cone with zero dimensions has no volume.

3. **Negative Values**: While a physical cone cannot have negative dimensions, the mathematical function does not specifically prohibit negative input, and it will still compute a volume.
   - Example: `func_1(-3, 5)` will return a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful but is mathematically computed correctly based on the formula.
   - The function does not handle negative values in terms of input validation, which could be considered a limitation.

Despite the potential limitation regarding negative inputs, the program accurately follows the formula of volume calculation for valid (including edge cases like 0) cone dimensions, indicating correctness for the described task. Therefore, I conclude that there are no failure cases that violate the stated problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius is a non-negative float or integer representing the radius of the cone, and height is a non-negative float or integer representing the height of the cone.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of the cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height, where radius is a non-negative float or integer and height is a non-negative float or integer.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
