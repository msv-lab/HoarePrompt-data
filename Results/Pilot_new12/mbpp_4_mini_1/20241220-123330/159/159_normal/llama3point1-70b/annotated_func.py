#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius is a non-negative float or integer representing the radius of the cone, and height is a non-negative float or integer representing the height of the cone.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of the cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height, where radius is a non-negative float or integer and height is a non-negative float or integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, radius and height, which are expected to be non-negative floats or integers representing the dimensions of a cone. It calculates and returns the volume of the cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. However, the function does not validate the input parameters, meaning that if any of them are negative or non-numeric, it may lead to unexpected errors. Therefore, the actual state post-execution depends on the input provided, and the lack of validation could result in runtime exceptions if the inputs don't meet expectations.
