Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements a linear search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` and checks if each element matches the target number. If a match is found, it returns the index of that match. If the target number is not present in the array, the function returns -1, which is the expected behavior. 

The output hints also align with the functionality of the program, confirming that the behavior of the function is as described. Additionally, the function handles the edge case where the array is empty by returning -1, in accordance with the problem description. 

Since all potential cases described in the problem statement are handled correctly, the program is deemed to be correct.
