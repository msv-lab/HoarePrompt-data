You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted array. However, it does not adequately maintain the assumption that the input array is sorted. 

For example, if the sorted array contains multiple occurrences of the specified number, and the number is present at multiple locations, the function will still return the index of the first found occurrence in a linear manner without taking advantage of the array's sorted property. This will work fine if the input is indeed sorted and behaves as expected. 

However, there are cases where the function could fail with an undefined behavior. Additionally, it does not optimize for a sorted array by employing binary search, which is the expected behavior when dealing with sorted data. 

For instance:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, `num = 2`
- The function correctly returns `1`. However, for a large sorted array, using a linear search results in poor performance compared to a binary search.

Moreover, if we test with an empty array:
- Input: `arr = []`, `num = 1`
- The function correctly returns `-1`, as expected.

However, the specific requirement to optimize for a sorted array—potentially using a method like binary search—is not implemented correctly here. Thus, while it might return the correct index for some input cases, it doesn't adhere to the optimal expectations set by the problem statement for every potential case involving a sorted array. Hence, correctness is deemed false based on this misalignment with the problem description's implicit expectations.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns its index. If `num` is found, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. Edge cases include the scenario where `arr` is empty, in which case the function will also return -1, since there will be no elements to match against `num`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may arise from invalid input types for `arr` and `num` but operates under the assumption that `arr` is a list of integers and `num` is an integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
