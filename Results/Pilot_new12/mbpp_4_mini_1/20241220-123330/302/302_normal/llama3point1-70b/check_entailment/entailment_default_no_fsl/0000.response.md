Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` accurately identifies the index of the first occurrence of `num` in the sorted array `arr`. The implementation:

1. Iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. Checks if the current element `x` matches the target `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index `i`.
3. If the loop completes without finding the number, it returns -1, indicating that `num` is not present in `arr`.

Edge cases are handled appropriately:
- If `arr` is empty, the function will correctly return -1.
- The program operates under the assumption that `arr` is a list of integers and `num` is an integer, and it behaves as expected under this assumption.

Therefore, the code meets the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases defined in the hints.
