Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It utilizes a simple linear search method with the following steps:

1. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x`.
2. When it finds an element `x` that matches `num`, it returns the index `i`.
3. If the loop completes without finding `num`, it returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not present in the array.

Given that the problem explicitly states that the input array is sorted, this implementation behaves correctly even for sorted arrays with duplicates. It will always return the index of the first occurrence of the specified number, handling edge cases like:
- The number is the first element.
- The number is the last element.
- The number does not exist in the array.
- The array is empty.

Since the program addresses all scenarios satisfactorily and has no flaws, the correctness outcome is confirmed.
