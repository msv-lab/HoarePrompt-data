Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, as specified in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s an analysis of the program based on the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(arr, num)` is defined to take a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`.

2. **Loop through the Array**: The program uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate through each element of the sorted array. This is appropriate for searching as it allows accessing both the index `i` and the value `x` at each iteration.

3. **Comparison with num**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current element `x` is equal to `num`. If a match is found, it returns the index `i` immediately, which corresponds to the first occurrence of `num` in the array.

4. **Return on No Match**: If no match is found after the loop (i.e., the loop has iterated through the entire list without returning), the program returns -1. This indicates that `num` is not present in `arr`, which is consistent with the requirement to handle cases where the number is not found.

5. **Sorted Array Assumption**: The program leverages the sorted nature of the array but does not explicitly implement binary search. However, it still adheres to the problem requirements since it correctly identifies the first occurrence or returns -1 if it doesn't exist.

The function produces the correct output in all expected scenarios as outlined in the problem description. Thus, it satisfies the requirement of finding the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted array and is therefore deemed correct.
