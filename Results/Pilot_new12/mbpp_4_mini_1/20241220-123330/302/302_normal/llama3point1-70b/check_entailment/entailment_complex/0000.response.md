Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` adheres to the problem description, which requires it to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Validity**: The function assumes that `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `num` is an integer, as stated in the annotations. The problem description explicitly mentions that these inputs will be valid.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses a for-loop along with the `enumerate` function to iterate through each element in the sorted array `arr`.
   - If the current element `x` equals `num`, the function immediately returns the index `i`, thus satisfying the requirement to find the first occurrence of `num`.
   - If the loop completes without finding `num`, the function returns -1, which correctly indicates that `num` is not present in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When `arr` is empty, the function does not enter the loop and directly returns -1, which is the expected behavior as there are no elements to match against `num`.

4. **Overall Behavior**: The function efficiently searches through the sorted list and adheres to the problem requirements by returning either the index of the first occurrence of `num` or -1 when `num` is not found. All possible input conditions described in the annotations are appropriately handled.

Therefore, the implementation is consistent with the problem description, and the correctness condition is satisfied.
