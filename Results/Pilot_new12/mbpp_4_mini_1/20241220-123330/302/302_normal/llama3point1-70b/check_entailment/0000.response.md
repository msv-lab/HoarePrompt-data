Correctness: **False**.

The given program aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted array. However, it does not adequately maintain the assumption that the input array is sorted. 

For example, if the sorted array contains multiple occurrences of the specified number, and the number is present at multiple locations, the function will still return the index of the first found occurrence in a linear manner without taking advantage of the array's sorted property. This will work fine if the input is indeed sorted and behaves as expected. 

However, there are cases where the function could fail with an undefined behavior. Additionally, it does not optimize for a sorted array by employing binary search, which is the expected behavior when dealing with sorted data. 

For instance:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, `num = 2`
- The function correctly returns `1`. However, for a large sorted array, using a linear search results in poor performance compared to a binary search.

Moreover, if we test with an empty array:
- Input: `arr = []`, `num = 1`
- The function correctly returns `-1`, as expected.

However, the specific requirement to optimize for a sorted array—potentially using a method like binary search—is not implemented correctly here. Thus, while it might return the correct index for some input cases, it doesn't adhere to the optimal expectations set by the problem statement for every potential case involving a sorted array. Hence, correctness is deemed false based on this misalignment with the problem description's implicit expectations.
