Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not utilize the fact that the input array is sorted, as it employs a linear search to find the first occurrence of the specified number. While it correctly finds the index of the first occurrence for some cases, it fails to meet the expectations outlined in the problem description, which implies that an optimized approach (like binary search) should be used for sorted arrays. This lack of optimization signifies a misalignment with the problem's requirements, therefore the assessment that the program's correctness is **False** is justified.
