The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as parameters. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returns its index. If `num` is found, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. Edge cases include the scenario where `arr` is empty, in which case the function will also return -1, since there will be no elements to match against `num`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may arise from invalid input types for `arr` and `num` but operates under the assumption that `arr` is a list of integers and `num` is an integer.
