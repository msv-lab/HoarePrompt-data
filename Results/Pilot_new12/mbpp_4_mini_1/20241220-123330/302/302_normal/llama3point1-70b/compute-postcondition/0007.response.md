According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `arr` contains at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means `i` will be 2. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. Assuming `arr` has at least 3 integers, then after this iteration, `x` will be the third integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, `x` is the third integer in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.**
