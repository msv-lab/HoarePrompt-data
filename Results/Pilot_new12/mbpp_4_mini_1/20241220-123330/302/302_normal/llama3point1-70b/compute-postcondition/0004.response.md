According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr`. If the list contains at least 1 integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 1 integer (specifically, it contains `x`, the first integer in the list), and we know `x` is not equal to `num`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1 in the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 0, it will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 integers (allowing `i` to reach 1), and `x` will then be the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
