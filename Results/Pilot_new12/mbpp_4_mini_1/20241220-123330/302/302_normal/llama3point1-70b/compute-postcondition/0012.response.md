The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a sorted list of integers, and `num`, which is an integer. After executing the function body, the function may return different values based on the presence and position of `num` in the sorted list `arr`. 

- If `num` is equal to the first integer in `arr`, the function returns `0`, indicating the starting index of `num`.
- If `num` matches an integer at the second index of `arr`, the function returns `1`.
- If `num` matches an integer at the third index of `arr`, the function returns `2`.
- If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `num` is not found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`, or -1 if `num` is not present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or -1 if `num` is not present.**
