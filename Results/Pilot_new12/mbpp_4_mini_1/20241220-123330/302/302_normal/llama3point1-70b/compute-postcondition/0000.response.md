According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have iterated through all elements in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed, the `arr` must have at least 1 integer, `i` will start at 0, and `x` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer in `arr`**
