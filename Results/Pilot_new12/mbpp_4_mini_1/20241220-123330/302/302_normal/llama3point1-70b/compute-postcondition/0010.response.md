Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is an integer, if `num` is present in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num` in `arr`; if `num` is not present, the function has no return value, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr` with `x` being the value at that index, or there are no integers in `arr` if the loop does not execute, making `i` undefined.**
