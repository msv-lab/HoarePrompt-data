You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the description, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail.

The task is to find the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a sorted array. 

Now let's break down how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 0 (the start of the array).
   - `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1` (the end of the array).
   - `result` is initialized to -1, which indicates that the target has not been found yet.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, it updates `result` to `mid` and continues searching to the left (by setting `high` to `mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence.
   - If the middle value is less than the target, the search space is updated by moving `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle value is greater than the target, the search space is updated by moving `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `result`, which would either be the index of the first occurrence of `target`, or -1 if `target` is not present.

Now let's evaluate the provided test cases:

1. For `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `1`, so this test case is correct.

2. For `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `2`, which is also correct.

3. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`:
   - The first occurrence of `6` is at index `4`, which is again correct.

While the provided test cases return the expected results, letâ€™s consider a test case that might not be covered:

- Consider `arr` to be empty, e.g., `func_1([], 5)`. The function would initialize `low` to `0` and `high` to `-1`. The loop `while low <= high` would not execute, and the function would return `-1`, which is correct as there are no elements in the array.

- Another potential edge case could be if the `target` is not in the array at all, e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)`, which should also return `-1`.

After checking multiple scenarios, including edge cases, the implementation appears to correctly handle finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array, even for an empty array and where the target is not present.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists, otherwise `result` remains -1. If `target` was present in the array, original `low` must have been less than or equal to the original `high`, and the loop executes until `low` exceeds `high`. If `target` is not found, `result` remains -1 indicating the absence of `target`.
    return result
    #The program returns -1 indicating that the target was not found in the array, as low is greater than high.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
