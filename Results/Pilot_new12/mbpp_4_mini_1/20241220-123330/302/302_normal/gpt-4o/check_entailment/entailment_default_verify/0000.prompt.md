You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the description, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail.

The task is to find the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a sorted array. 

Now let's break down how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 0 (the start of the array).
   - `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1` (the end of the array).
   - `result` is initialized to -1, which indicates that the target has not been found yet.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, it updates `result` to `mid` and continues searching to the left (by setting `high` to `mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence.
   - If the middle value is less than the target, the search space is updated by moving `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle value is greater than the target, the search space is updated by moving `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `result`, which would either be the index of the first occurrence of `target`, or -1 if `target` is not present.

Now let's evaluate the provided test cases:

1. For `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `1`, so this test case is correct.

2. For `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `2`, which is also correct.

3. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`:
   - The first occurrence of `6` is at index `4`, which is again correct.

While the provided test cases return the expected results, letâ€™s consider a test case that might not be covered:

- Consider `arr` to be empty, e.g., `func_1([], 5)`. The function would initialize `low` to `0` and `high` to `-1`. The loop `while low <= high` would not execute, and the function would return `-1`, which is correct as there are no elements in the array.

- Another potential edge case could be if the `target` is not in the array at all, e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)`, which should also return `-1`.

After checking multiple scenarios, including edge cases, the implementation appears to correctly handle finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array, even for an empty array and where the target is not present.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` exists in the array, it returns the index of its first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target was not found. The implementation correctly handles cases where the target is less than, greater than, or equal to elements in the array, and it ensures that it searches for the first occurrence by continuing to search in the left half of the array when a match is found. There are no considerations for empty arrays or non-integer elements, which could be potential edge cases, but within the scope of a sorted list of integers, the behavior is well-defined.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
