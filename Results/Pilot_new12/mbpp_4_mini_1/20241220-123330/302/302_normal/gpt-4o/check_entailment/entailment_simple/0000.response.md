Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number (target) in a sorted array (arr). It uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for this problem since the array is sorted.

Hereâ€™s how the function works in accordance with the problem description:
1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to define the current section of the array being searched.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
4. If the element at `mid` matches the target, it updates the result to `mid` and continues searching the left half of the array (to find the first occurrence) by adjusting `high`.
5. If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it moves the search to the right half by updating `low`.
6. If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it moves the search to the left half by adjusting `high`.
7. After the loop finishes (when `low` exceeds `high`), it returns `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target or -1 if the target was not found.

The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for specific test cases, and the logic ensures that it always returns the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array.

Hence, the program satisfies the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, making it correct according to the problem description.
