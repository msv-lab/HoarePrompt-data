To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the description, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail.

The task is to find the index of the **first occurrence** of a given number in a sorted array. 

Now let's break down how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 0 (the start of the array).
   - `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1` (the end of the array).
   - `result` is initialized to -1, which indicates that the target has not been found yet.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, it updates `result` to `mid` and continues searching to the left (by setting `high` to `mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence.
   - If the middle value is less than the target, the search space is updated by moving `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If the middle value is greater than the target, the search space is updated by moving `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `result`, which would either be the index of the first occurrence of `target`, or -1 if `target` is not present.

Now let's evaluate the provided test cases:

1. For `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `1`, so this test case is correct.

2. For `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`:
   - The first occurrence of `5` is at index `2`, which is also correct.

3. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`:
   - The first occurrence of `6` is at index `4`, which is again correct.

While the provided test cases return the expected results, letâ€™s consider a test case that might not be covered:

- Consider `arr` to be empty, e.g., `func_1([], 5)`. The function would initialize `low` to `0` and `high` to `-1`. The loop `while low <= high` would not execute, and the function would return `-1`, which is correct as there are no elements in the array.

- Another potential edge case could be if the `target` is not in the array at all, e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)`, which should also return `-1`.

After checking multiple scenarios, including edge cases, the implementation appears to correctly handle finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array, even for an empty array and where the target is not present.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
