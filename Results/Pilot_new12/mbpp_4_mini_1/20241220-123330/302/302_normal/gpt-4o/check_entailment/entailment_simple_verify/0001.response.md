Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted array. The program's logic aligns with the problem description and the annotations reinforce this correctness.

The annotations indicate that before the function call, the inputs are valid (a sorted list and an integer), and they clarify the state of variables during execution. The explanation regarding the loop's termination condition and how `result` is determined correctly summarizes the behavior of the function. Specifically, when a match is found, `high` is decremented to continue searching on the left side of the array, ensuring that the first occurrence is returned. 

Furthermore, all test cases provided are correctly handled, returning the expected output. The state of the program after the loop confirms that `result` will either contain the index of the first occurrence of the target or -1 if the target is absent, which aligns perfectly with the requirement laid out in the problem description.

Given all this corroborating evidence, the program meets the problem's requirements, and the original assessment of correctness stands validated.
