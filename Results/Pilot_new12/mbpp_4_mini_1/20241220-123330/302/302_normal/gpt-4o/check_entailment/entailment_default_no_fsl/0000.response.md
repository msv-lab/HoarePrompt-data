Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case of an empty array. If `func_1` is called with an empty array and any target (e.g., `func_1([], 5)`), it would return -1, which indicates that the target wasn't found. However, according to the problem statement, the function should ideally handle and explicitly return a results for an empty list case. In its current state, the code is not fully correct since there is no handling for empty arrays, which is a valid edge case. Thus, it does not meet the requirement of correctness for every potential case.

While the code does function correctly for the provided test assertions, the lack of handling for empty arrays means it cannot guarantee correctness across all specified cases.
