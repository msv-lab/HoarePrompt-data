Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iteratively narrows down the search space using the `low` and `high` indices and updates the `result` variable when it finds the target value. It specifically modifies the `high` index to continue searching in the left half of the array even after finding a match, ensuring that it returns the first occurrence of the target.

The assertions provided correctly test the function for multiple cases, and all of them match the expected outcomes as described:

1. For the input array `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `5`, the first occurrence is at index `1`.
2. For the input array `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `5`, the first occurrence is at index `2`.
3. For the input array `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `6`, the first occurrence is at index `4`.

I cannot think of an example where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description, and all examined cases return the correct indices. Therefore, the program is correct in all potential scenarios addressed by the problem description.
