You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iteratively narrows down the search space using the `low` and `high` indices and updates the `result` variable when it finds the target value. It specifically modifies the `high` index to continue searching in the left half of the array even after finding a match, ensuring that it returns the first occurrence of the target.

The assertions provided correctly test the function for multiple cases, and all of them match the expected outcomes as described:

1. For the input array `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `5`, the first occurrence is at index `1`.
2. For the input array `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `5`, the first occurrence is at index `2`.
3. For the input array `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` and target `6`, the first occurrence is at index `4`.

I cannot think of an example where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description, and all examined cases return the correct indices. Therefore, the program is correct in all potential scenarios addressed by the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` exists in the array, it returns the index of its first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target was not found. The implementation correctly handles cases where the target is less than, greater than, or equal to elements in the array, and it ensures that it searches for the first occurrence by continuing to search in the left half of the array when a match is found. There are no considerations for empty arrays or non-integer elements, which could be potential edge cases, but within the scope of a sorted list of integers, the behavior is well-defined.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
