Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Hereâ€™s how it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function correctly accepts two parameters: a sorted list of integers (`arr`) and an integer (`target`). The problem description specifies these requirements, and the implementation adheres to them.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The algorithm efficiently searches through the sorted array using binary search:
   - It maintains two pointers, `low` and `high`, to define the current search space.
   - It calculates the midpoint (`mid`) of the current search space and checks if the element at `mid` is equal to `target`.
   - If a match is found, it updates the `result` to store the index of `mid` and continues to search in the left half of the array (by adjusting `high`) to ensure that the first occurrence is found.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, it narrows the search to the right half, and if it's greater, it narrows the search to the left half.

3. **Returning the Result**: The function returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence of `target` if it exists in `arr`, or `-1` if `target` is not found. This aligns perfectly with the problem requirement to find the index of the first occurrence or indicate absence with `-1`.

4. **Handling Duplicates**: The implementation successfully addresses the scenario where the target may have multiple occurrences in the array, as it continues to search leftwards after finding a match.

In conclusion, the function `func_1` consistently performs the specified task of finding the index of the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array, effectively handling various scenarios, including duplicates and absent targets. Therefore, it adheres to the problem description provided, confirming its correctness.
