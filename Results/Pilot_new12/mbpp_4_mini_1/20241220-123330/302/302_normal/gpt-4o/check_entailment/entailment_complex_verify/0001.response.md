Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. The annotations elaborate on the internal state of the program before and after the loop, clarifying how the search space is narrowed and how the result is determined based on whether the target exists in the array. 

All assertions provided match the expected outcomes based on the problem description, demonstrating that the function behaves as required for the given test cases. Additionally, the annotations confirm that the function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the target or -1 if it is not found, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the original assessment reasoning, the program is indeed correct.
