Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given target number in a sorted array. The logic in the function ensures that once a match is found, the algorithm continues searching the left half of the array to ensure that it finds the first occurrence of that target. The output hints align with the code, indicating that it handles cases where the target is less than, greater than, or equal to elements in the array. Since there's no indication of potential edge cases with valid inputs as per the problem description, the program is considered correct for the task it was designed to accomplish.
