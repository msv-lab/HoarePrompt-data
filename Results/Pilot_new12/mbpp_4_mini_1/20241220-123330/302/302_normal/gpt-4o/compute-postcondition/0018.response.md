The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be the integer halfway between `low` and `high`, plus one. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is not empty, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, and `mid` is still equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the update.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the update.**
