The value of `mid` is assigned to be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, the resulting value of `mid` will always be between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
