The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, where `mid` was recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be a valid integer that is the average of `low` and `high`. Therefore, `high` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, resulting in a new value for `high`.

Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `high` as `previous_high`. Then the new value of `high` becomes `previous_high - 1`.

The other variables `arr`, `low`, and `mid` remain unchanged, but we note that `mid` is now equal to `(low + previous_high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + previous_high) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `previous_high - 1`.**
