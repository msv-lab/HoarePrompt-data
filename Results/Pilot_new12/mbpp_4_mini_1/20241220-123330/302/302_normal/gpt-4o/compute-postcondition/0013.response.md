Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` does not equal `target`, and `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1.***
