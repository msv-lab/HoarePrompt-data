The value of `mid` is recalculated using the formula `(low + high) // 2`, which calculates the midpoint index between `low` and `high`. Since it is given that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` will be a valid index between `low` and `high`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
