According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute again as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which implies that the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments. 

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is the index calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
