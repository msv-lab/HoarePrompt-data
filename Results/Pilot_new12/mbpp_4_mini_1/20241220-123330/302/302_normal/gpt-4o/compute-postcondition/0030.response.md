Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists, otherwise `result` remains -1. If `target` was present in the array, original `low` must have been less than or equal to the original `high`, and the loop executes until `low` exceeds `high`. If `target` is not found, `result` remains -1 indicating the absence of `target`.**
