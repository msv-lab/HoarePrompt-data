Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, keeping `high` unchanged, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` after the update. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` while `low` remains unchanged, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.***
