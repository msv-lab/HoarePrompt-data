The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, it implies that `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`. The previous values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. The condition states that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, and since `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, it indicates that `low` will now be adjusted to potentially search for a greater value in the next iteration. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `arr` must not be empty,
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` (still valid before update),
- the value of `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`,
- the current value of `arr[mid]` is less than `target`,
- `low` is now updated to `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, the current value of `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`.**
