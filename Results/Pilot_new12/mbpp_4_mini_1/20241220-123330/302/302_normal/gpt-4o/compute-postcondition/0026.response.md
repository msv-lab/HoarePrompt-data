The code assigns to `low` the value `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, we know `mid` represents the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Therefore, after executing `low = mid + 1`, `low` will become one more than this value of `mid`.

The initial state includes the conditions that `arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is defined based on `low` and `high`. As `low` is updated, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, where `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` remains less than or equal to `high`.**
