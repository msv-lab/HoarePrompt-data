The variable `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` has already been calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means it is dependent on the current values of `low` and `high`. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is a valid integer, and thus `high` will be one less than this valid number.

Therefore, the new output state reflects the change in `high` while retaining the other valid conditions:

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**.
