`high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The variable `mid` is previously calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` is now decremented by 1 from that calculated midpoint value. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `low`, and `mid`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`.**
