The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Before this assignment, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` is reduced by 1 from its previous state. The states of the other variables are not affected by this change, so we retain their prior conditions. 

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` equals `mid`, `high` is `mid - 1`.**
