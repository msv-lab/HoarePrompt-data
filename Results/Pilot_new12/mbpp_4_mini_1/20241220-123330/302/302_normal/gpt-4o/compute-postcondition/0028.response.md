Postcondition: ***If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while maintaining that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `previous_high - 1`, while `low` remains less than or equal to `high` and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + previous_high) // 2`.***
