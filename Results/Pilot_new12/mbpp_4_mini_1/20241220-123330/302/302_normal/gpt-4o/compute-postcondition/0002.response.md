According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers, this ensures that `high` is non-negative as long as `arr` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least one element (ensuring `high` is greater than or equal to 0). 

Since we need the loop condition `low <= high` to hold true for the loop to execute, we see that `low` is already set to 0 and `high` needs to be â‰¥ 0. Given that `high` is defined as `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` should not be empty for the loop to initiate.

Thus:
State: **`arr` must not be empty**.
