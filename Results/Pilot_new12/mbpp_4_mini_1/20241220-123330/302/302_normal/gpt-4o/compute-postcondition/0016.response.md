In the given code, `result` is assigned the value of `mid`. 

The initial state provides that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. This means that `mid` is calculated based on the values of `low` and `high`, where `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

After executing the code:
- The previous state of `arr` remains unchanged (it is still not empty).
- The values of `low` and `high` are also unchanged.
- The new value of `result` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which is the current value of `mid`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is not empty, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` equals `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` equals `mid`.**
