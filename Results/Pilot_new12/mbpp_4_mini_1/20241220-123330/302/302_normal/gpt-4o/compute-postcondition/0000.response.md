The variables `low` and `high` are assigned values based on the length of the `arr`. The value of `low` is set to `0`, and the value of `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the indices of the first and last elements of the sorted list `arr`, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(arr) - 1**
