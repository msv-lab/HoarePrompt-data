The value of `result` is set to -1. The states of the other variables `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(arr) - 1, and `result` is -1.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(arr) - 1, `result` is -1**.
