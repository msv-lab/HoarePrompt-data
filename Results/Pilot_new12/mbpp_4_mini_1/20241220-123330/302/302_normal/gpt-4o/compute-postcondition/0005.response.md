The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. The initial state specifies that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and `arr[mid]` equals `target`, meaning `result` will now have the same value as `mid`. The states of the other variables, including `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `target`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `arr[mid]` equals `target`, and `result` is equal to `mid`.**
