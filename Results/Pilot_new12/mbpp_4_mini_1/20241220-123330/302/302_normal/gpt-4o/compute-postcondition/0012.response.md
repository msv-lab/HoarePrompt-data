Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and the value of `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1.***
