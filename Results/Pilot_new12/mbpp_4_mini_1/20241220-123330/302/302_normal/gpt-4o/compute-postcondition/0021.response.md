Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is the index calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, the variable `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` while `low` remains unchanged, and `mid` is again equal to `(low + high) // 2`.***
