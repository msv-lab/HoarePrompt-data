The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer. If the `target` is not found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target was not found. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return -1 if the target is not found in the array. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns -1 if the target is not found in the array.**
