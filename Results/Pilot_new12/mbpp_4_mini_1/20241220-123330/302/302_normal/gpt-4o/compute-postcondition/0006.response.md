The code updates the variable `high` by assigning it the value of `mid - 1`. The initial condition states that `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, which means `mid` is a valid index within `arr`. The specific value of `high` changes as a result of this assignment, while all other conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is equal to `mid`, `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`.**
