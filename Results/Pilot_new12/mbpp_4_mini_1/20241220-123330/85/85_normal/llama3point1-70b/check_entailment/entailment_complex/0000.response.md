Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts a list of integers as input, and it accurately calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the list by using the expression `max(arr) - min(arr)`. 

Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: The program indeed uses the `max()` function to find the highest value in the list `arr` and the `min()` function to find the lowest value. The difference between these two values directly corresponds to the maximum difference between any two elements in the list.

2. **Handling Empty Lists**: The annotations indicate that if the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. However, as per the given problem description, we assume that the input will always be valid, meaning that there will always be at least one element in the list. Thus, the potential for raising a `ValueError` due to an empty list does not affect the correctness of the program under the assumption that the input adheres to the stated conditions.

3. **Operation Validity**: The operations performed by the function (calculating the maximum and minimum values) are valid for a non-empty list of integers, and the program effectively returns the expected outputâ€” the maximum difference between any two elements.

Therefore, under the given assumptions and the way the function is structured, the program correctly fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description.
