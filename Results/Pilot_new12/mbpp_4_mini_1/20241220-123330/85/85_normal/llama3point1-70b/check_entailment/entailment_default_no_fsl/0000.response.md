Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, if the input list `arr` is empty, the code raises a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate `max(arr)` and `min(arr)`. The problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, but a program that raises an error in such a case is incomplete in the context of ensuring correctness for all inputs.

For example:
- Input: `arr = []` (an empty list)
- The program will raise an error instead of returning a maximum difference, which violates the expectation that the function should always return a value or handle the case gracefully.

Since the program fails to account for the case of an empty input list, it is considered incorrect.
