You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the function `func_1(arr)` which aims to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Correct Handling of Arrays**: The function uses `max()` and `min()` to compute the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This will give the maximum difference for valid non-empty arrays.
2. **Empty Array Case**: The program does not handle the case of an empty array (`arr`). If an empty array is passed to `max()` or `min()`, it will raise a `ValueError` because these functions require at least one element to operate on.
3. **Single Element Array**: The program will return `0` for an array with a single element, which is technically a correct output as the difference between the maximum and minimum of a single element is zero.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an empty array `arr = []`, calling `func_1(arr)` will raise an exception:
  ```python
  func_1([])  # Raises ValueError
  ```
- For a single element array `arr = [5]`, it returns:
  ```python
  func_1([5])  # Returns 0 (5 - 5)
  ```

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the empty array case, which is a valid input scenario as per the problem description. Thus, since the function fails to address this potential case, it does not meet the requirements fully.

Correctness: **False** 

The lack of handling for an empty array is a specific example demonstrating that the function does not work as expected under all potential inputs described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate the maximum or minimum, as these operations cannot be performed on an empty list. Thus, the final state of the program will include the result as the difference between the largest and smallest integers found in the list, or it will terminate with an error if the list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
