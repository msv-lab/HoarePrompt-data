Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the function is correct, but it overlooks a crucial aspect regarding the behavior of the function with empty lists. According to the output hints, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate the maximum or minimum of an empty list, which means that the function does not correctly handle this edge case. The problem description does not mention valid input conditions, so we cannot assume that the input will always be a valid non-empty array. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements under all scenarios, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment is inaccurate. The function could fail in real-world usage when given an empty list, which invalidates the correctness claim.
