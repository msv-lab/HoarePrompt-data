To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the function `func_1(arr)` which aims to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Correct Handling of Arrays**: The function uses `max()` and `min()` to compute the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This will give the maximum difference for valid non-empty arrays.
2. **Empty Array Case**: The program does not handle the case of an empty array (`arr`). If an empty array is passed to `max()` or `min()`, it will raise a `ValueError` because these functions require at least one element to operate on.
3. **Single Element Array**: The program will return `0` for an array with a single element, which is technically a correct output as the difference between the maximum and minimum of a single element is zero.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an empty array `arr = []`, calling `func_1(arr)` will raise an exception:
  ```python
  func_1([])  # Raises ValueError
  ```
- For a single element array `arr = [5]`, it returns:
  ```python
  func_1([5])  # Returns 0 (5 - 5)
  ```

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the empty array case, which is a valid input scenario as per the problem description. Thus, since the function fails to address this potential case, it does not meet the requirements fully.

Correctness: **False** 

The lack of handling for an empty array is a specific example demonstrating that the function does not work as expected under all potential inputs described in the problem statement.
