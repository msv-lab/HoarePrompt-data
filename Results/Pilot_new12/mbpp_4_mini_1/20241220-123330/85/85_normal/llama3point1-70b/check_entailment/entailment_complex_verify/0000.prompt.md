You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach works for various scenarios:

1. Normal cases with positive integers: e.g., for the input `[3, 1, 4]`, the output is `4 - 1 = 3`.
2. Cases where the array contains negative integers: e.g., for `[-1, -2, -3]`, the output is `-1 - (-3) = 2`.
3. Cases with mixed positive and negative integers: e.g., for `[-1, 0, 1]`, the output is `1 - (-1) = 2`.
4. Single element arrays: The result is always `0`, as the maximum and minimum are the same.
5. Empty arrays: The code does not handle this case explicitly, but typically the behavior is to raise an error with the `max()` and `min()` functions. However, since we only consider the correctness of logic here, we conclude that the function works correctly for valid input according to the problem description.

Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr', which are the highest and lowest integers in the list of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate the maximum or minimum, as these operations cannot be performed on an empty list. Thus, the final state of the program will include the result as the difference between the largest and smallest integers found in the list, or it will terminate with an error if the list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
