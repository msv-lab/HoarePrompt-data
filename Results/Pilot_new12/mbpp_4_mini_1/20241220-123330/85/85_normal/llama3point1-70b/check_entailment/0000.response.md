Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach works for various scenarios:

1. Normal cases with positive integers: e.g., for the input `[3, 1, 4]`, the output is `4 - 1 = 3`.
2. Cases where the array contains negative integers: e.g., for `[-1, -2, -3]`, the output is `-1 - (-3) = 2`.
3. Cases with mixed positive and negative integers: e.g., for `[-1, 0, 1]`, the output is `1 - (-1) = 2`.
4. Single element arrays: The result is always `0`, as the maximum and minimum are the same.
5. Empty arrays: The code does not handle this case explicitly, but typically the behavior is to raise an error with the `max()` and `min()` functions. However, since we only consider the correctness of logic here, we conclude that the function works correctly for valid input according to the problem description.

Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
