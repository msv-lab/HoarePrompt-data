Explanation: The function defined in the program correctly follows the problem description, which specifies that it should find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `arr`, which indeed represents the maximum difference between any two elements. Additionally, the output hints correctly note that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is acceptable under the assumption that valid input will always be provided. Since the program correctly handles all specified cases and its functionality aligns with the problem description, we conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
