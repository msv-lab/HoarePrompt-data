Final: **True**

The program accurately meets the problem description, which requires finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1` correctly implements this by returning the result of `max(arr) - min(arr)`, effectively identifying the highest and lowest values in the list of integers.

Moreover, the annotations support the correctness by clearly describing the state of the program before the function call, indicating that the input is validated as a list of integers. Additionally, they confirm that the function operates as intended by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

The original assessment indicating correctness is supported by both the logic of the implementation and the annotations provided. Hence, the final conclusion remains accurate based on the evidence available.
