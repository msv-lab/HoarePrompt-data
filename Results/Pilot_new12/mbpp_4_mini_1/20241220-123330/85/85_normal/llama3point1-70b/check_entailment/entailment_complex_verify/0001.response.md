Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that the function `func_1(arr)` does not handle the case of an empty array, which is an important scenario when considering the problem description. The program raises a `ValueError` if it receives an empty list, thus failing to meet the requirements outlined in the problem statement for valid input handling. Although the annotations note that the function expects a list of integers, they also acknowledge the potential error with an empty list, which confirms that the original assessment's takeaway about the function's correctness is valid. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotations, the program does not operate as intended under all specified scenarios, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
