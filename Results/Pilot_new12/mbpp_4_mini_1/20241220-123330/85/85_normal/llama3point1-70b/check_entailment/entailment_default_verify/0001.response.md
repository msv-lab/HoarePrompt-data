Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate as it correctly identifies that the function does not handle the case of an empty array, which leads to a `ValueError` when attempting to call `max()` or `min()` on an empty list. Since the problem description does not specify constraints on the array being non-empty, the original assessment concludes that the program does not meet the requirements fully. Thus, the program is deemed incorrect due to its inability to handle all expected input scenarios as described, leading to a final correctness assessment of **False**.
