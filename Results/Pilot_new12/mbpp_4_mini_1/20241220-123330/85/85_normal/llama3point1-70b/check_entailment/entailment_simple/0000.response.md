Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(arr)` computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the array `arr` by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Maximum Difference Calculation**: The program uses the `max()` function to find the highest value in the list and the `min()` function to find the lowest value. The difference between these two values (`max(arr) - min(arr)`) provides the maximum difference between any two elements in the list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

2. **Handling Valid Input**: Since the problem assumes valid input, the absence of checks for empty lists or non-list inputs does not affect the correctness here, as per the guidelines provided.

Overall, the program correctly fulfills the requirement to find and return the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. Therefore, it is correct according to the provided specifications.
