Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate the maximum or minimum, as these operations cannot be performed on an empty list. Thus, the final state of the program will include the result as the difference between the largest and smallest integers found in the list, or it will terminate with an error if the list is empty.**
