Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's how it satisfies that requirement:

1. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**: The function `func_1(arr)` computes the minimum value and the maximum value from the input array using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. 

2. **Calculating the Difference**: It then calculates the difference between the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`). This difference represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirement.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns this calculated difference.

The test assertions also validate the function's correctness against various input arrays, confirming that it produces the expected results. Each test case checks a different scenario of input and verifies that the maximum difference is correctly calculated.

Overall, given that the program correctly interprets and implements the problem description, it is confirmed to be correct.
