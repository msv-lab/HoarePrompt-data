Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case of an empty input correctly. In Python, calling `min()` and `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. Although the annotations state that the input will be a "list of integers" and assume valid input, the original problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid or non-empty. Therefore, the program fails to handle a legitimate case by raising an unhandled exception, which ultimately indicates that the program cannot be considered correct in all circumstances outlined in the problem description.
