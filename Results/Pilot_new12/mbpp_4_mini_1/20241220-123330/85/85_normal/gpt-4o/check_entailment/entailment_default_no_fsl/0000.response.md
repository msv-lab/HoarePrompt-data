Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly, as indicated in the output hints. The problem description states that the function should find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. If the array is empty, the `min()` and `max()` functions will raise a `ValueError`, which makes the code incorrect since it does not fulfill the requirement to handle every potential case. 

Additionally, while the code works correctly for non-empty arrays, it does not address the fact that the problem must define behavior for an empty input, which is a significant edge case. Since the function will raise an error for an empty input and behave correctly only for valid, non-empty inputs, it cannot be deemed fully correct.
