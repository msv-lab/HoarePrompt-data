Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It computes the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here is a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Parameter handling**: The function `func_1(arr)` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The problem description does not specify restrictions on the length of this list or its contents (except that they are integers), so the function seems to comply with this aspect as it processes valid integer lists.

2. **Finding minimum and maximum values**: The program uses `min(arr)` and `max(arr)` to find the minimum and maximum values in the list. This correctly identifies these values based on the given input array.

3. **Calculating maximum difference**: The core operation of the function, which is `max_val - min_val`, directly calculates the maximum difference between the two extremes of the list. This matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

4. **Handling of edge cases**: The program assumes that it will receive valid and non-empty input according to the problem statement. It correctly identifies that if the list contained only one unique value, the maximum difference would be zero (which is technically still a correct difference). 

5. **Returned output**: The function correctly returns the calculated maximum difference.

Since all potential cases covered by the program (valid non-empty integer lists, lists with the same element, etc.) align with the intended output per the problem description, the program is verified as correct.

Thus, the correctness of the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
