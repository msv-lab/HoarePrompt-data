Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case of an empty input, which raises a `ValueError` when trying to compute the minimum or maximum of an empty sequence. This is a violation of the output hints stating that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, revealing that the function does not satisfy the problem description comprehensively. Thus, the conclusion that the program is incorrect stands firm.
