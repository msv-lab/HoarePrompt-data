Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array is empty. If `func_1` is called with an empty tuple (or any empty iterable), both `min(arr)` and `max(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`, since there are no elements to find the minimum or maximum. 

Example of a failing case:
```python
func_1(())  # This will raise a ValueError
``` 

Hence, since the program does not handle this edge case, it is incorrect.
