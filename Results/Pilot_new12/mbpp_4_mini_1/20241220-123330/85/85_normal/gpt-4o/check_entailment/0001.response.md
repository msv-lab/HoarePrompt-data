Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the `min()` and `max()` functions and then calculates the difference between these two values.

The provided assertions test the function with different arrays:
1. For `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since I cannot think of any edge cases or input scenarios where the program fails (like an empty array or arrays with all identical elements, as they are not specified in the assertions), I conclude that the program behaves correctly according to the given problem description. The function will produce a maximum difference of 0 for arrays where all elements are identical, and will raise an error for empty arrays, which is acceptable since the problem does not provide instructions on handling such cases.

Thus, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
