The program provided defines a function `func_1` which is expected to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The implementation correctly employs the `min()` and `max()` functions to compute the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list.

After reviewing the output hints: 
1. The function is designed to handle the case of an empty array by raising a `ValueError`, which is appropriate because `min()` and `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence.
2. If the list contains only one unique value, the function will return a difference of zero, which also adheres to the expected behavior, since both maximum and minimum in such a case would be equal.

The checks using assertions indicate that the function indeed produces correct results for the provided test cases, yielding the expected differences of `4`, `8`, and `2`, respectively.

Since there are no noted issues with the code's adherence to the problem description for valid inputs, and it appropriately handles edge cases (e.g., empty lists raise errors), the implementation meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
