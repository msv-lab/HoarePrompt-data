`max_val` is assigned the maximum value found in the list `arr`. The values of `arr` influence `max_val`, and since `min_val` is defined as the minimum value in `arr`, it is still valid that `max_val` will be greater than or equal to `min_val`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, and `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`.**
