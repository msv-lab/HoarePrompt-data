The value of `min_val` is assigned the minimum value from the list `arr`. The state of `arr` remains the same, but `min_val` will now hold the smallest integer from that list. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`**
