The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `arr`, calculated as `max_val - min_val`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return the difference between the maximum and minimum values found in that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.**
