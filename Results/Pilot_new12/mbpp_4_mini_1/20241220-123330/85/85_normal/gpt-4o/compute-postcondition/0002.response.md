The variable `max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val - min_val`. The values of `min_val` and `max_val` are derived from the list `arr`, so `max_diff` will represent the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in that list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
