#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list 'arr' which is equal to max_val - min_val.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and returns the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If `arr` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` and `max()` functions cannot operate on an empty sequence. If `arr` contains only one unique value, the returned difference will be zero, as both the maximum and minimum will be equal. Therefore, it effectively computes `max(arr) - min(arr)` for the provided list, ensuring to handle the case of empty lists by raising an error.
