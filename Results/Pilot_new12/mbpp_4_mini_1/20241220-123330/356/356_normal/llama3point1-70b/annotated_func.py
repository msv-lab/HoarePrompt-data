#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_str is a string.
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns input_str with all spaces removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. It does not modify the original string but creates a new one that omits any whitespace characters. Edge cases such as input strings with leading or trailing spaces, multiple spaces, or strings that contain only spaces are handled, resulting in an empty string when appropriate. However, the function does not handle cases with other whitespace character types (like tabs or newlines), which means they will remain unchanged in the output.
