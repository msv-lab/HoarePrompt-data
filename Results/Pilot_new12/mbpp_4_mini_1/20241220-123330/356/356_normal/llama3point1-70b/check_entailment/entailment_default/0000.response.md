The provided program removes spaces from a string using the `replace` method. However, the output hints indicate that the function fails to account for other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs or newlines. According to the problem description, the function should remove all whitespace from the input string.

Since the program does not fulfill the requirement to remove all types of whitespace (only spaces are removed), it is incorrect. 

Correctness: **False**.
