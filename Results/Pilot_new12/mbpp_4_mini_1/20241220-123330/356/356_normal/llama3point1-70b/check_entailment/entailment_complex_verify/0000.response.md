Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program correctly meets the problem description by removing all whitespaces, but the annotations clarify that the function only removes spaces and does not handle other types of whitespace characters such as tabs and newlines. The problem description requires the function to remove "all whitespaces," which must include all forms of whitespace characters. Therefore, given that the implementation is insufficient in this aspect, the final conclusion on the program's correctness should reflect this discrepancy.
