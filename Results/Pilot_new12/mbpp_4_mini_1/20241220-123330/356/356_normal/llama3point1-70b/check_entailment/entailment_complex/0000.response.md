Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description because it only removes spaces from the input string and does not address other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or other non-space whitespace characters. The problem description specifies that the function must remove "all whitespaces," which implies that it should remove all types of whitespace characters, not just spaces. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as outlined, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
