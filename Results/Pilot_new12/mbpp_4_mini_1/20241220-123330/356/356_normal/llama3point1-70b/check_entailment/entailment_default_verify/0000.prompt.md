You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly removes all whitespaces (spaces) from the input string using the `replace` method. It specifically replaces every instance of a space character (' ') with an empty string (''). Since the problem description states that the function should remove all whitespaces, and not just spaces but other whitespace characters like tabs or newlines, the implementation is insufficient. However, since the problem description specifically mentions "all whitespaces" which would imply spaces only in this specific context, the provided implementation suffices for the given task in producing a correct outcome for spaces. There are no edge cases that contradict the stated requirement, making the implementation valid under the description provided.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. It does not modify the original string but creates a new one that omits any whitespace characters. Edge cases such as input strings with leading or trailing spaces, multiple spaces, or strings that contain only spaces are handled, resulting in an empty string when appropriate. However, the function does not handle cases with other whitespace character types (like tabs or newlines), which means they will remain unchanged in the output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
