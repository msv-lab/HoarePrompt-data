Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all whitespace characters, as it only removes spaces (' '). According to the output hints, it mentions that the function does not manage other whitespace types like tabs ('\t') or newlines ('\n'). Therefore, for an input string containing these characters, the output would not be as expected. For instance, given the input `"  Hello\tWorld\n "`, the expected output should be `"HelloWorld"` with all types of whitespace removed, but the program would return `"Hello\tWorld"` instead, leaving the tab and newline intact. This illustrates that the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all whitespaces from a string.
