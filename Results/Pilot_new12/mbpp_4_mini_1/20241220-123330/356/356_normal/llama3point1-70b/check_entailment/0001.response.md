Correctness: **False**

The provided program only removes space characters (' ') from the string, but it does not handle other types of whitespace, such as tabs (`\t`), new lines (`\n`), or other whitespace characters defined in the Unicode standard. 

For example, given the input string `input_str = "Hello\tWorld\n"`, the expected output by the problem description (removing all whitespaces) would be `"HelloWorld"`, but the program would return `"HelloWorld\n"` since it does not remove the tab and newline characters. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of removing all whitespaces from the string, which makes it incorrect.
