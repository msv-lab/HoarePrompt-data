Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not remove all types of whitespace characters from the string; it only removes spaces (' '). The problem description explicitly states to remove "all whitespaces" from a string, which typically includes not just spaces but also tabs, newlines, and other whitespace characters. 

To meet the problem description accurately, the program should use a method that removes all whitespace characters, such as using the `str.replace()` for each type of whitespace or utilizing a method like `str.split()` and `str.join()` to handle all whitespace in one go. 

Therefore, since the implementation only removes spaces and does not account for other whitespace characters, it does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
