Based on the problem description, the function is required to remove all types of whitespace from a string. The program provided only addresses a specific case by removing space characters (' '), and fails to account for other whitespace characters like tabs (`\t`), new lines (`\n`), and other Unicode whitespace characters that may be present in a string.

The original assessment, which states that the correctness is **False**, accurately reflects the program's failure to meet the problem description's requirements. The annotation confirms that the program only removes spaces without addressing other whitespace, thus supporting the assessment.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate and aligns with the problem description and the behavior of the code. 

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
