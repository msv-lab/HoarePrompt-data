Final: **False**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is not accurate given the details in the annotated version of the code. While the function `func_1` correctly removes standard space characters (' '), it does not address other forms of whitespace, such as tabs or newlines, which may be present in the input string. The problem description specifies the need to remove "all whitespaces" from the string, which includes all forms of whitespace characters, not just spaces.

Therefore, the implementation does not fully meet the requirement as outlined in the problem description, since it only handles one specific type of whitespace (spaces) and ignores others. Consequently, the program's inability to handle all whitespace characters leads to a final assessment of correctness as **False**.
