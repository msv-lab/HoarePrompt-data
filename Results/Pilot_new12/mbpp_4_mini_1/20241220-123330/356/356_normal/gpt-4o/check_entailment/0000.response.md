Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from a string by using the `replace` method, which targets every occurrence of a single space character (' '). The assertions given in the program demonstrate that the function works as intended for various cases, including multiple spaces between words and leading spaces. Since there isn't any situation where the function fails to meet the problem description, the code is considered correct.
