Correctness: **False**

The program's implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the function must "remove all whitespaces from a string." However, the implementation of `func_1` only removes standard space characters (' '), leaving other types of whitespace (such as tabs `\t` or newlines `\n`) intact. As such, this implementation fails to meet the requirement to remove all types of whitespace.

For example, if we input a string like `'python\tprogram'`, the expected output should be `'pythonprogram'`, but the current implementation would return `'python\tprogram'`, which still contains a tab. Thus, the function does not handle all the whitespace characters as required, demonstrating that the implementation is incorrect.
