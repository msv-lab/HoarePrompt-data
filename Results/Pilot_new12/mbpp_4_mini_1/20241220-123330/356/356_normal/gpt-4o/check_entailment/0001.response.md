Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality needed to remove all whitespaces from a given string. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces (' ') in the input string `s` with an empty string (''). 

I considered multiple test cases, including strings with various numbers of spaces, leading spaces, and paragraphs with spaces, and they all produced the expected results. Specifically:

1. For the input `'python  program'`, the output is `'pythonprogram'`.
2. For the input `'python   programming    language'`, the output is `'pythonprogramminglanguage'`.
3. For the input `'python                     program'`, the output is `'pythonprogram'`.
4. For the input `'   python                     program'`, the output is `'pythonprogram'`.

No edge cases or examples were found that the function does not handle as described â€“ the function handles leading, trailing, and multiple spaces in between words effectively. Therefore, all examples considered worked correctly according to the problem's requirements.
