Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to remove all whitespaces from a given string. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string input `s` and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces (' ') with an empty string (''). 

The provided assertions in the annotated program test various cases of strings containing different amounts and placements of whitespace:

1. `func_1('python  program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`, which is correct.
2. `func_1('python   programming    language')` returns `'pythonprogramminglanguage'`, which is also correct.
3. `func_1('python                     program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`, maintaining correctness.
4. `func_1('   python                     program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`, which again is correct, as it removes leading whitespace.

Since all spaces (including multiple spaces, leading spaces, and trailing spaces) are effectively removed by the function, it meets the requirements of the problem description for valid input strings. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
