Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all types of whitespace characters as specified in the problem description. The function only removes standard space characters (' '), but does not address other whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`) or newlines (`\n`). For example, calling `func_1('python\tprogram')` would return 'python\tprogram', leaving the tab intact, which does not meet the requirement to remove all whitespaces. Additionally, it does not cover the case when input contains multiple types of whitespace or if it's completely empty, though the original program does handle an empty string correctly by returning an empty string.

Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem for every potential case provided, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
