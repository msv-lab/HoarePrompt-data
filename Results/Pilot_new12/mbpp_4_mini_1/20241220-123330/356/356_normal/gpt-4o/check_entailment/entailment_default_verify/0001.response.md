Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements defined in the problem description by successfully removing all spaces from the input string. The output hints corroborate this as they clarify that the function specifically targets standard spaces and correctly retains the original string if no spaces are present. 

The function has been tested against various cases, including leading spaces, trailing spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces, and all yielded the expected results. Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as an empty string, as expected, returning an empty string.

Thus, based on the problem description, the behavior described in the output hints, and the program's implementation, the assessment of correctness remains valid.
