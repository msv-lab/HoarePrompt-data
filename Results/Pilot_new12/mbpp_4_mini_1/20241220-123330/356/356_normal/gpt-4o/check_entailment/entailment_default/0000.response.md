The provided program aims to remove all standard space characters from a given string. The function `func_1` uses the method `replace` to remove spaces, returning the modified string. 

However, the output hints indicate that the function only removes standard space characters (' '), which means that other whitespace characters (like tabs `\t`, newlines `\n`, etc.) will remain untouched. The problem description does not explicitly state the requirement to only remove standard spaces, which suggests that any form of whitespace, including tabs and newlines, should ideally be removed for a more comprehensive solution.

Considering these aspects:

- While the function serves its purpose for standard spaces correctly, it does not address other whitespace characters.
- In scenarios where a string has tabs or newlines, those characters will remain after processing, which is not in line with a general expectation of removing all whitespace from a string.

Thus, the function fails to fulfill the complete intent of removing all kinds of whitespace characters, making it incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of failure:
If the input string is `'python\tprogram\n'`, the output would be `'python\tprogram\n'`, where the tab and newline characters are not removed, demonstrating that the solution does not meet the broader expectation of removing all whitespaces.
