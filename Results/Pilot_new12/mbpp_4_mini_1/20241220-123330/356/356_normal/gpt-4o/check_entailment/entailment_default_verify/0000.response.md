The program description requires a function that removes all whitespaces from a string. The provided program, `func_1`, uses the `replace` method to remove only standard space characters (' '). This is reflected in the output hints, which clarify that tabs or newlines are not affected by the operation—this means that if such whitespace characters exist in the input string, they will remain unchanged.

Since the problem description does not specify which types of whitespace need to be removed—only stating to remove all whitespaces—this means that the program's behavior of retaining newlines and tabs does not meet the expectations set forth by the problem description.

Given these clarifications from the output hints and the implications of the problem description, the original assessment claiming the program is correct fails to take into account the functionality of other whitespace removals that are presumably expected based on how "whitespace" is usually defined. 

Therefore, the previous assessment that the program is correct does not hold true when considering these outputs and the information provided.

Final: **False**
