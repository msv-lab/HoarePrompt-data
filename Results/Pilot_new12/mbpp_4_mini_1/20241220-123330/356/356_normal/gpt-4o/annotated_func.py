#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string 's' with all spaces removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. It performs this operation only on standard space characters (' '), meaning that other whitespace characters such as tabs or newlines will not be removed. It's important to note that if `s` does not contain any spaces, the function will return the original string unchanged. In the case where `s` is an empty string, the function will also return an empty string. Therefore, the final state of the program is that the input string `s` is transformed into a version without spaces, while other forms of whitespace remain intact.
