Correctness: **False**.

The function is intended to return the nth Lucas number. However, the implementation has a few issues. Specifically, the assertion tests are defined before the function `func_1(n)` is implemented, which can lead to confusion regarding function correctness.

Moreover, the for loop in the function definition:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
```
is set to iterate correctly from 2 to n inclusive, so by that logic, it should return the right value for inputs of n = 0 and n = 1 correctly, but it might not execute as expected if called with negative numbers or an unhandled case such as `n=0` and `n=1`, which are the base cases.

An edge case not handled is for any negative values of `n`. For example:
- Calling `func_1(-1)` would cause the function to skip the base cases, leading to incorrect behavior since it expects non-negative integers.

Thus, the program does not handle all possible inputs correctly and is therefore incorrect.
