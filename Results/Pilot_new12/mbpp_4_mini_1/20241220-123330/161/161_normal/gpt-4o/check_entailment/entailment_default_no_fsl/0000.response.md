Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to compute the nth Lucas number, but the hint indicates that it calculates Fibonacci numbers for values greater than 1. The logic within the function `func_1` is incorrect due to this misunderstanding. The first few Lucas numbers are as follows: 

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3
- L(3) = 4
- L(4) = 7
- L(5) = 11
- L(6) = 18
- L(7) = 29
- L(8) = 47
- L(9) = 76

The function erroneously computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers for `n > 1`. For instance, `func_1(2)` should return 3 (the 2nd Lucas number) but will return 3 (the 3rd Fibonacci number), which is incorrect. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required for calculating Lucas numbers, which demonstrates that it does not satisfy the problem description.

Thus, since the code fails to produce the correct output for valid cases like `func_1(2)`, it is deemed incorrect.
