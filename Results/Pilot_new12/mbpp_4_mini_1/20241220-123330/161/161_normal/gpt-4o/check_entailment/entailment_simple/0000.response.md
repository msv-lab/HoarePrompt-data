Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to compute the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. However, upon close examination, the implementation actually calculates the n-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. 

Here are the key points of failure:

1. **Definition Misalignment**: The Lucas numbers are defined as:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1
   
   On the other hand, the Fibonacci numbers are defined as:
   - F(0) = 0
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Incorrect Results**: The program correctly returns L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, but when executing the for loop, it iteratively calculates Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers. For instance, L(2) should return 3, L(3) should return 4, L(4) should return 7, and L(9) should return 76, but the logic in the loop does not adhere to the Lucas sequence, leading to incorrect results for n â‰¥ 2.

As a result, the implementation violates the requirements set forth in the problem description by incorrectly calculating the Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers.
