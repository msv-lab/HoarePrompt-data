Final: **False**

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program computes the n-th Lucas number while implying that it also computes Fibonacci numbers. The function `func_1` is actually a misstatement of what is computed; while it correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the definitions provided, the output hints incorrectly describe it as computing Fibonacci numbers for `n > 1`.

The output hints explicitly say the function returns Fibonacci numbers for `n > 1`, which is inaccurate. The definitions for Lucas numbers (L(n)) were correctly presented in the problem description, but the part indicating that the function calculates Fibonacci numbers when `n > 1` contradicts the Lucas number calculations.

Thus, the correctness stated in the original assessment regarding the implementation and the output hints is flawed. The function behaves correctly for calculating Lucas numbers for non-negative integers, but the hints state erroneous information about the function's behavior for `n > 1`, causing confusion. Therefore, the final correctness assessment must be adjusted to reflect these discrepancies.
