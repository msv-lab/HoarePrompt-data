To determine the correctness of the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code, let's analyze the points provided:

**Problem Description**: The goal is to write a function to find the n-th Lucas number.

**Annotated Code Overview**:
1. The base case of the Lucas sequence for `n = 0` should return `2` and for `n = 1` should return `1`, which is correct according to the Lucas sequence definition.
2. For values of `n > 1`, the program computes the Lucas numbers correctly using an iterative approach.
3. The assertions demonstrate that the function is expected to return the correct values at least for the specified input values of `9`, `4`, and `3`.

**Original Assessment**: The original assessment claims the function is incorrect due to:
- The ordering of assertions before the function definition, which can lead to confusion.
- Not handling negative values for `n`.

**Evaluation of Original Assessment**:
- While the assessment mentions confusion with assertions' ordering, it does not impact the correctness of the function once it is defined.
- The program does not handle negative inputs, but the annotation specifies an assumption that the input will be a non-negative integer. As such, we adhere to this assumption for the purpose of correctness evaluation.
- The code correctly implements the functionality to compute the n-th Lucas number for valid, expected inputs.

**Conclusion Based on Annotations**:
The annotated version of the code succinctly confirms that the return values for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and any valid positive integers are accurate in accordance with the Lucas number definition. There are no overlooked edge cases for the specified valid input, and all assertions correctly match the expected outcomes of Lucas numbers.

Thus, given the assumptions and the analysis of the annotated behavior of the function, it is correct to assert that the program does correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for valid non-negative integers.

Final: **True**
