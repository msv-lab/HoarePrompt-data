You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

The function `func_1` checks for the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning the correct Lucas numbers (2 and 1, respectively). For values of `n` greater than or equal to 2, it uses a loop to compute the n-th Lucas number iteratively, ensuring that the defined relationship between the numbers is maintained.

The test cases provided:

- `func_1(9)` should yield 76, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` should yield 7, which is correct.
- `func_1(3)` should yield 4, which is also correct.

Since all the base cases and computed values for the Lucas numbers for the given `n` in the test cases are correct, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the implementation appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Thus, the program functions correctly according to the specified criteria.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and performs the following actions: If `n` is 0, it returns 2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The function handles all cases for non-negative integers, specifically addressing edge cases for 0 and 1, and correctly computes Fibonacci numbers for values greater than 1. There are no missing edge cases or logic within the scope of non-negative integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
