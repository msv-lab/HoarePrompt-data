The annotated version of the code contains a critical inconsistency. While the program is described as computing the Lucas numbers, the statement derived from the loop indicates that it returns the n-th Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas numbers are distinct from Fibonacci numbers, despite having a similar recursive definition. 

To break it down:

1. According to the Lucas number definition:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - For n >= 2: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
   
The logic in `func_1` for the base cases is correct for the Lucas numbers. However, when stating the results of the loop:
- The states suggest that `a` represents the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number and `b` represents the n-th Fibonacci number. This is incorrect for the problem stated (which is about Lucas numbers) and would mislead anyone reading the program.

Given that the annotated version states the program computes Fibonacci numbers instead of Lucas numbers, this is a significant deviation from the problem requirements.

**Because of this misalignment, the original assessment that the program is correct is flawed. Thus, the final assessment should conclude that the program does not meet the problem description.**

Final: **False**
