Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

The function `func_1` checks for the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning the correct Lucas numbers (2 and 1, respectively). For values of `n` greater than or equal to 2, it uses a loop to compute the n-th Lucas number iteratively, ensuring that the defined relationship between the numbers is maintained.

The test cases provided:

- `func_1(9)` should yield 76, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` should yield 7, which is correct.
- `func_1(3)` should yield 4, which is also correct.

Since all the base cases and computed values for the Lucas numbers for the given `n` in the test cases are correct, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the implementation appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Thus, the program functions correctly according to the specified criteria.
