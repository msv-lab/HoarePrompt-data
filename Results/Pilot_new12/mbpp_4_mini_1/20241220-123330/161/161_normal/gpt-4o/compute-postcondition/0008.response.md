The code performs a simultaneous assignment that swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and assigns `a + b` to `a`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. Therefore, after the execution:

1. The new value of `a` will be `b`, which is 1.
2. The new value of `b` will be the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

The initial values state that `n` is at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, and `_` is 2, and we only update `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
