In this code, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped and updated. The new value of `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 3
- `_` is 3

When executing the code `a, b = b, a + b`, we have:
- Previous value of `b` is 3.
- Previous value of `a` is 1.
- The new value for `a` will be 3 (previous value of `b`).
- The new value for `b` will be 4 (1 + 3).

Thus, after execution:
- `a` becomes 3
- `b` becomes 4

The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
