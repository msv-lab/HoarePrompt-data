The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values 2 and 1 respectively. This assignment does not affect the variable `n`, which remains a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
