Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and performs the following actions: If `n` is 0, it returns 2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The function handles all cases for non-negative integers, specifically addressing edge cases for 0 and 1, and correctly computes Fibonacci numbers for values greater than 1. There are no missing edge cases or logic within the scope of non-negative integers.**
