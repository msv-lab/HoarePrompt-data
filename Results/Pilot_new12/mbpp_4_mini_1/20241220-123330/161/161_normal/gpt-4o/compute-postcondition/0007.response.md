According to the code, the loop will execute over the range from 2 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, because the range function generates numbers starting from 2 up to and including `n`. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, this means `n` must be 2 or greater. The value of `n` must be determined as well, and the iteration variable (underscore `_`) will take on the values starting from 2 up to `n`. 

At the beginning of the loop, when `n` is set to 2, the loop will start iterating with the first iteration having the underscore `_` equal to 2. 

The states should therefore indicate that `n` is at least 2, since it's specified as greater than 0 and not equal to 1. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, and `_` is 2 for the first iteration**
