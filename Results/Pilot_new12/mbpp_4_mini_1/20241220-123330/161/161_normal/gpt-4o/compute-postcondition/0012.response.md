The variables `a` and `b` are being assigned new values based on their existing values. Specifically, `b` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `a` is assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. However, we have no information about the initial values of `a` and `b` before this line of code is executed. Therefore, their individual values cannot be determined, but we can say:

1. `a` takes the value of the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`.
2. `b` takes the original value of `b`.

No other variables are affected in this context. The initial state confirms that `_` is 4, but it does not provide direct information about `a` or `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `_` is 4; `a` is the previous value of `a` + the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `b`.**
