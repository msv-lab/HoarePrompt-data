After considering the loop's structure and the initial conditions provided, here's the determined output state:

The loop executes a number of times based on the value of `n`. Each iteration updates the values of `a` and `b` according to the Fibonacci-like sequence. The loop continues until `_` reaches `n`, which determines how many times the loop executes.

When the loop finishes executing, the value of `a` will be the `n-1`th Fibonacci number (starting from 1), and the value of `b` will be the `n`th Fibonacci number. Since the loop starts with `a` initialized to 2 and `b` initialized to 1, and `n` is at least 2, they are modified accordingly through the iterations.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n` is less than 2), then `a` remains 2 and `b` remains 1.

Taking all of this into consideration, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `a` is the `(n-1)`th Fibonacci number; `b` is the `n`th Fibonacci number.**
