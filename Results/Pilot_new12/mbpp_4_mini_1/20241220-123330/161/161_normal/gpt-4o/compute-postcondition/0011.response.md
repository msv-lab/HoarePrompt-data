According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as the loop variable `_` iterates through the range from 2 to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is at least 3
- `_` is 3

This means the last executed value of `_` was 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 (since the loop will iterate until `_` reaches `n + 1`, and when `_` is 4, it will be in the range if `n` is 3 or more).

If `n` is 4 or more, then `_` would increment to 4 on the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 and the next value of `_` will be 4.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `_` is 4**
