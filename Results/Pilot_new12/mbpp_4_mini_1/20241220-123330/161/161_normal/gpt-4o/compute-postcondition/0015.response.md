The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 2. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1, which is a constant value indicating the execution result. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number, denoted as `b`, where `b` is defined as the nth Fibonacci number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the input: 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the nth Fibonacci number if `n` is greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns 2 if n is 0, 1 if n is 1, and the nth Fibonacci number if n is greater than 1.**
