According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 2. 

Now, in the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will become 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
