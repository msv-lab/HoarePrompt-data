#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1, which is a constant value indicating the execution result.
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `a` is the `(n-1)`th Fibonacci number; `b` is the `n`th Fibonacci number.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci number, b, where n is a non-negative integer greater than 1 and b is defined as the nth Fibonacci number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and performs the following actions: If `n` is 0, it returns 2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The function handles all cases for non-negative integers, specifically addressing edge cases for 0 and 1, and correctly computes Fibonacci numbers for values greater than 1. There are no missing edge cases or logic within the scope of non-negative integers.
