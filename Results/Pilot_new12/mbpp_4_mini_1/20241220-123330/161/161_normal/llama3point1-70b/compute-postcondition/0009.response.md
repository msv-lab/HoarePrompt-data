According to the code, the loop executes for values starting from 2 up to and including `n`. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, so to execute the loop one more time, `n` must be at least 3. The loop variable `_` will get the value of 2 in the first iteration, and with each iteration, it will increment by 1. 

Thus, if the last iteration caused `_` to be equal to `n`, in order for it to execute again, the value of `_` would be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. Therefore, the states should reflect that `_` is currently 2 (for the next iteration), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
