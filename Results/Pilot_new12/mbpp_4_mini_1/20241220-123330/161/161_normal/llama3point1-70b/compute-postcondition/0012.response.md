The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. The previous value of `a` is 3 and the previous value of `b` is 4. After executing the code, `b` will be assigned the value of `a`, which is 3, and `a` will be assigned the value of 4 + 3, which is 7.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 7, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
