`a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a + b`. The initial values are `a = 2` and `b = 1`. After executing the code, `a` will be `1` (the old value of `b`) and `b` will be `3` (the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1`). The other variable `n` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
