To derive the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how `a` and `b` are modified in each iteration of the loop. The variables start with `a` initialized to 2 and `b` initialized to 1.

The loop iterates for the range from 2 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute `n - 1` times. Each iteration updates `a` and `b` as follows:

- `a` takes the value of `b` (the previous value of `b` becomes the new `a`).
- `b` takes the value of `a + b` (the new value of `b` becomes the sum of the previous `a` and `b`).

Initially, we have:
- `a` = 2
- `b` = 1

For further iterations:
1. After 1st iteration:
   - Previous `a` = 2, Previous `b` = 1
   - New `a` = 1 (previous `b`), New `b` = 3 (2 + 1)

2. After 2nd iteration:
   - Previous `a` = 1, Previous `b` = 3
   - New `a` = 3 (previous `b`), New `b` = 4 (1 + 3)

3. After 3rd iteration:
   - Previous `a` = 3, Previous `b` = 4
   - New `a` = 4 (previous `b`), New `b` = 7 (3 + 4)

Continuing this process iteratively we establish that the value of `a` and `b` follow the sequence defined by the recurrence relation, which leads to values evolving based on the previous two numbers in each iteration.

After the loop executes for `n - 1` times (thus finishing all iterations), the final values of `a` and `b` would be such that `a` will be the value of `b` before the loop finished, and `b` will be the sum of the previous two values.

Thus, after all iterations:
- `b` will be the $(n-1)$-th number in the sequence (with the first two numbers defined by 1 and 2).
- Consequently, the output values are determined by how many times the loop executes, which is `n - 1`.

Taking into account potential constraints:
- If `n` is 2, the loop will run exactly once, else for each increment in `n`, `b` will be further updated according to our observations.

Explicitly summarizing, if no iterations of the loop occur (which strictly doesn't happen here since `n > 0`), `a` remains 2 and `b` remains 1. 

Lastly, for the output state after all iterations:
Output State: **`a` is `b` value at the end of all iterations, `b` is the $(n-1)$-th number in the sequence following `b` starts at 1 and the second number is 2.**
