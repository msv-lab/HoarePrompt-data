The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. Thus, after the execution of the code:

1. `a` becomes `b`, which is 3.
2. `b` becomes `a + b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.

Therefore, the updated values are `a = 3` and `b = 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 2**
