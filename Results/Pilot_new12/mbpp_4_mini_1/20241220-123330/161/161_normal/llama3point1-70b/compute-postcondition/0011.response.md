According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes for the range starting at 2 up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 2 (the first iteration), and the loop will increment `_` with each iteration. 

To execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented. Since `_` starts at 2, it will increment to 3 for the next iteration. The loop continues as long as `_` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (to allow `_` to be 3) and the value of `_` will become 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
