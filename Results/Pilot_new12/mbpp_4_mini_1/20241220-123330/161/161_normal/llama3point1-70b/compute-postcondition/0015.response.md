The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the integer 2. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns the integer 1. For all other cases where `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the $(n-1)$-th number in a sequence that starts with 1 and 2, where `b` is defined as the $(n-1)$-th number in that sequence. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the value of `n`, including defined sequence numbers for `n` greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 2 if n is 0, returns 1 if n is 1, and returns the (n-1)-th number in a sequence starting at 1 and 2 for n greater than 1.**
