The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number, where the sequence starts with 1 (the 0th Fibonacci number) and 2 (the 1st Fibonacci number). The function does not handle negative integers, which could potentially lead to misuse if such values are passed.
