Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Definition of Lucas Numbers**: The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci sequence but start with 2 and 1. Specifically, L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - When `n` is 0, the function correctly returns 2 (which is L(0)).
   - When `n` is 1, the function correctly returns 1 (which is L(1)).

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For n >= 2, the function initializes two variables `a` and `b` to represent the two most recent Lucas numbers (L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1).
   - The for loop iteratively calculates subsequent Lucas numbers by updating `a` and `b` until it reaches L(n), where `b` ends up containing the n-th Lucas number.

4. **Correct Return Value**: After the loop completes, the function returns `b`, which correctly represents L(n).

Considering all of the above points, the program is implemented correctly and adheres to the problem description's requirements.
