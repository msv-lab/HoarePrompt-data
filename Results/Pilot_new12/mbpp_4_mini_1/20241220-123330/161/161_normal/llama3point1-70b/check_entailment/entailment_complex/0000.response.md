The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Analysis:
1. The problem requires a function to find the n-th Lucas number.
2. The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).

### In the Annotated Program:
- For `n = 0`, it correctly returns `2` (L(0)).
- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns `1` (L(1)).
- For any `n > 1`, the program behaves like it is calculating the Fibonacci numbers, not the Lucas numbers. Specifically, it computes the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number rather than the n-th Lucas number.

### Conclusion:
The overall behavior of the function is to return the Fibonacci-like sequence for values of `n > 1`, which deviates from correctly computing the Lucas numbers.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
