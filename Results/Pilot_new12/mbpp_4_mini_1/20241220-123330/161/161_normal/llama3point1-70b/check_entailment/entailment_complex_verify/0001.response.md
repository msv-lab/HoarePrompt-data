Based on the provided considerations, the program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for non-negative integers. The annotated version confirms that the function adheres to the definitions provided in the problem statement and accurately matches the Lucas number definitions for inputs `n = 0` and `n = 1`. 

However, both the original assessment and the annotated version indicate a significant issue: the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative. While we assume valid inputs will be provided, the absence of this handling still constitutes a flaw in terms of strict correctness as per the general acceptance of function definitions in programming where they should ideally handle all potential inputs as stated in the problem description without causing misuse or errors.

This lack of handling for negative integers suggests that a user providing a negative integer would receive an incorrect result (e.g., returning `1` for `n = -1`), which is not a valid case for Lucas numbers since they are defined strictly for non-negative integers.

Thus, I maintain that the original assessment is correct. It accurately identifies that the program's validity and correctness are compromised due to its lack of handling for negative integers.

Final: **False**
