The program is designed to compute the n-th Lucas number, which is defined correctly according to the problem description. The original assessment identifies that the program correctly handles non-negative integers (specifically starting from 0) and computes the Lucas numbers as defined, but it also points out a notable flaw in that the program does not handle negative values. 

However, as per the annotated version of the code, it further clarifies that the program assumes `n` will always be a non-negative integer. Thus, under the assumption stated in the task that valid inputs will be provided, the function works correctly for all non-negative integers as intended. The annotation confirms the computed values according to the Lucas sequence throughout the iterations.

Considering that we are specifically instructed to assume valid input will always be provided (and no errors will arise from invalid inputs), the assessment does not need to consider undefined behavior for negative inputs within this context, as those cases fall outside the expected usage.

Therefore, based on the reasoning through the annotations and understanding that valid inputs are guaranteed, the original assessment's conclusion about the correctness of the program is justified. 

Final: **True**
