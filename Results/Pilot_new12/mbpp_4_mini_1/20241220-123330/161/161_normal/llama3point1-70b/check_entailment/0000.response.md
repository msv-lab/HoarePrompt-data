To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description for finding the n-th Lucas number, let's first review the logic behind the Lucas sequence:

1. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - For n >= 2: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The provided program implements this logic recursively for the base cases (0 and 1) and iteratively for n >= 2. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to represent L(n-2) and L(n-1) respectively, and updates them in each iteration to compute L(n).

Now we will examine the program more closely for any potential cases it might not handle correctly:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

- The base cases seem to be handled correctly:
  - For `n = 0`, it returns `2`, which is correct.
  - For `n = 1`, it returns `1`, which is also correct.
  
- For `n >= 2`, it calculates the Lucas numbers iteratively using a loop.

Now let's analyze whether the iteration correctly computes the n-th Lucas number:

1. For n = 2: 
   - L(2) should be L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3. 
   - The program will compute it as follows: a = 2 (L(0)), b = 1 (L(1)). 
   - After one iteration (when _=2), it will set a = 1 (L(1)), b = 3 (1 + 2).
   - It returns b, which is 3. This is correct.

2. Further values:
   - For n = 3: 
     - L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4. 
     - b is correctly computed as 4 after two iterations.
   - For n = 4: 
     - L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7. 
     - This will be correct after three iterations.

From these examples, the pattern continues to hold, and the implementation appears to correctly compute L(n) for all n â‰¥ 0.

There are no edge cases or missing logic in the implementation. The algorithm correctly computes all requested values based on the definition of Lucas numbers.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for every potential case based on the Lucas sequence definition.
