Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to compute the n-th Lucas number. However, the output hints indicate that for values of `n` greater than 1, the function returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number as required by the problem statement. The Lucas sequence starts with `L(0) = 2` and `L(1) = 1`, and follows the recurrence relation `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)` for `n >= 2`.

For instance, for `n = 2`, the expected Lucas number is `L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3`, but the function incorrectly returns `1`, which is the 1st Fibonacci number.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
