The original assessment states that the program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number based on the definition provided. However, upon reviewing the program and the annotated version, there is a critical issue with the annotated explanation and the function's operation.

The function correctly returns the Lucas number for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, which are defined as L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, respectively. But for values of `n >= 2`, as described in the annotations, the function states that it returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number rather than the n-th Lucas number. This critical error undermines the correctness of the program.

The annotated code states that after the for loop, `b` is the (n-1)-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. This is incorrect because the program is supposed to return the n-th Lucas number.

Thus, the original assessment is inaccurate because it incorrectly affirms the program's operation based on the task of finding Lucas numbers whereas, according to both the program implementation and its annotations, it computes Fibonacci numbers for `n >= 2`.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the program does not meet the problem description and is not correct. 

Final: **False**
