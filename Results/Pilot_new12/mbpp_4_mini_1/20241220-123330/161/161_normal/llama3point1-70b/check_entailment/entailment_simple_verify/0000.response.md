After reviewing the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the annotated version, I have determined the correctness of the program as follows:

The problem description asks for a function that finds the n-th Lucas number, which the assessment correctly defines. The assessment accurately identifies the recursive definition of the Lucas numbers and notes that the program handles this correctly for both base cases (n = 0 and n = 1). The iterative calculation employed for n â‰¥ 2 is also correctly described.

Analyzing the annotated version:
- The initial state before the function call confirms that n is a non-negative integer, aligning with the function's expected input.
- The return values for n = 0 and n = 1 are correctly annotated.
- The description following the loop indicates that 'b' indeed ends up storing the (n-1)-th number of the Lucas sequence, which, upon returning, represents the n-th Lucas number due to how the loop's logic unfolds iteratively.

The annotated version effectively supports the correctness claims made in the original assessment.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description and is adequately supported by the annotations, the conclusion remains that the program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number.

Final: **True**
