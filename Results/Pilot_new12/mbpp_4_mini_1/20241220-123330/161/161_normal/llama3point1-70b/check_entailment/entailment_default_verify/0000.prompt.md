You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description for finding the n-th Lucas number, let's first review the logic behind the Lucas sequence:

1. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - For n >= 2: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The provided program implements this logic recursively for the base cases (0 and 1) and iteratively for n >= 2. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to represent L(n-2) and L(n-1) respectively, and updates them in each iteration to compute L(n).

Now we will examine the program more closely for any potential cases it might not handle correctly:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

- The base cases seem to be handled correctly:
  - For `n = 0`, it returns `2`, which is correct.
  - For `n = 1`, it returns `1`, which is also correct.
  
- For `n >= 2`, it calculates the Lucas numbers iteratively using a loop.

Now let's analyze whether the iteration correctly computes the n-th Lucas number:

1. For n = 2: 
   - L(2) should be L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3. 
   - The program will compute it as follows: a = 2 (L(0)), b = 1 (L(1)). 
   - After one iteration (when _=2), it will set a = 1 (L(1)), b = 3 (1 + 2).
   - It returns b, which is 3. This is correct.

2. Further values:
   - For n = 3: 
     - L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4. 
     - b is correctly computed as 4 after two iterations.
   - For n = 4: 
     - L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7. 
     - This will be correct after three iterations.

From these examples, the pattern continues to hold, and the implementation appears to correctly compute L(n) for all n â‰¥ 0.

There are no edge cases or missing logic in the implementation. The algorithm correctly computes all requested values based on the definition of Lucas numbers.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for every potential case based on the Lucas sequence definition.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number, where the sequence starts with 1 (the 0th Fibonacci number) and 2 (the 1st Fibonacci number). The function does not handle negative integers, which could potentially lead to misuse if such values are passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
