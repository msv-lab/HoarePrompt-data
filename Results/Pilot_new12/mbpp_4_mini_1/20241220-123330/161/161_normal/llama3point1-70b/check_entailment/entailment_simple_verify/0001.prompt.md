You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program that computes the n-th Lucas number, we need to compare the implementation with the definition of the Lucas sequence. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, let's analyze the provided function step-by-step:

1. **Input and Base Cases**:
   - For `n == 0`, the function correctly returns `2`, which matches the definition.
   - For `n == 1`, the function correctly returns `1`, which also matches the definition.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function initializes `a` to `2` and `b` to `1`, corresponding to L(0) and L(1). 
   - The for loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` such that `b` always holds the latest calculated value of L(n).

3. **Lucas Sequence Calculation**:
   - The update in the for loop correctly computes the next value in the Lucas sequence by summing the two previous values.

4. **Complete Range**: 
   - The loop continues calculating until it includes the n-th Lucas number, and the return statement correctly provides `b`, which at that point will be L(n).

Overall, the code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all valid integers `n >= 0`. 

Considering edge cases (`n < 0`):
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer. This should be noted as a potential issue since the Lucas numbers are traditionally defined only for non-negative indices.
- If `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the for loop does not execute, and the result would be `b` which would simply return `1` instead of throwing an error or returning an appropriate defined value. This shows the implementation assumes that `n` will always be non-negative without any validation.

Therefore, there exists an input case (`n < 0`), where the code does not work as expected per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the integer 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns the integer 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is `b` value at the end of all iterations, `b` is the $(n-1)$-th number in the sequence following `b` starts at 1 and the second number is 2.
            return b
            #The program returns the $(n-1)$-th number in the sequence following that starts at 1 and 2, where `b` is the $(n-1)$-th number in that sequence.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
