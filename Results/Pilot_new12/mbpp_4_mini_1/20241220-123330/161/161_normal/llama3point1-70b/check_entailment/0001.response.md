To determine the correctness of the given program that computes the n-th Lucas number, we need to compare the implementation with the definition of the Lucas sequence. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, let's analyze the provided function step-by-step:

1. **Input and Base Cases**:
   - For `n == 0`, the function correctly returns `2`, which matches the definition.
   - For `n == 1`, the function correctly returns `1`, which also matches the definition.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function initializes `a` to `2` and `b` to `1`, corresponding to L(0) and L(1). 
   - The for loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` such that `b` always holds the latest calculated value of L(n).

3. **Lucas Sequence Calculation**:
   - The update in the for loop correctly computes the next value in the Lucas sequence by summing the two previous values.

4. **Complete Range**: 
   - The loop continues calculating until it includes the n-th Lucas number, and the return statement correctly provides `b`, which at that point will be L(n).

Overall, the code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all valid integers `n >= 0`. 

Considering edge cases (`n < 0`):
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer. This should be noted as a potential issue since the Lucas numbers are traditionally defined only for non-negative indices.
- If `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the for loop does not execute, and the result would be `b` which would simply return `1` instead of throwing an error or returning an appropriate defined value. This shows the implementation assumes that `n` will always be non-negative without any validation.

Therefore, there exists an input case (`n < 0`), where the code does not work as expected per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
