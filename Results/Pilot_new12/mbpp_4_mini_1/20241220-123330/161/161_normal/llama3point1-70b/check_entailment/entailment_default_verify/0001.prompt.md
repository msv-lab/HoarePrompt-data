You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program that computes the n-th Lucas number, we need to compare the implementation with the definition of the Lucas sequence. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Now, let's analyze the provided function step-by-step:

1. **Input and Base Cases**:
   - For `n == 0`, the function correctly returns `2`, which matches the definition.
   - For `n == 1`, the function correctly returns `1`, which also matches the definition.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `n > 1`, the function initializes `a` to `2` and `b` to `1`, corresponding to L(0) and L(1). 
   - The for loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` such that `b` always holds the latest calculated value of L(n).

3. **Lucas Sequence Calculation**:
   - The update in the for loop correctly computes the next value in the Lucas sequence by summing the two previous values.

4. **Complete Range**: 
   - The loop continues calculating until it includes the n-th Lucas number, and the return statement correctly provides `b`, which at that point will be L(n).

Overall, the code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all valid integers `n >= 0`. 

Considering edge cases (`n < 0`):
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer. This should be noted as a potential issue since the Lucas numbers are traditionally defined only for non-negative indices.
- If `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the for loop does not execute, and the result would be `b` which would simply return `1` instead of throwing an error or returning an appropriate defined value. This shows the implementation assumes that `n` will always be non-negative without any validation.

Therefore, there exists an input case (`n < 0`), where the code does not work as expected per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number, where the sequence starts with 1 (the 0th Fibonacci number) and 2 (the 1st Fibonacci number). The function does not handle negative integers, which could potentially lead to misuse if such values are passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
