The original assessment concluded that the provided program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. The assessment thoroughly described how the program handles different cases of `n`, including the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and iteratively computes the values for `n >= 2`.

However, there is a significant discrepancy highlighted in the output hints, which state that for values of `n` greater than 1, the function returns the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. This contradicts the intended functionality of the program to compute the n-th Lucas number. Specifically, the output hints indicate that the logic used in the iterative computation effectively leads to a misinterpretation of the algorithm, as it is misaligned with the definition of the Lucas sequence.

Since the program does not accurately compute the n-th Lucas number for `n > 1`, as dynamically stated in the output hints, the conclusion shifts from correctness to incorrectness.

Thus, after examining the provided hints in conjunction with the problem description, it's clear that the original assessment is not accurate, leading to the final determination of the program's correctness.

Final: **False**
