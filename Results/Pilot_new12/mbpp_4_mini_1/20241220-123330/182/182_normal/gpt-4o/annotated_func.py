#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing strings.
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, an empty string will be included in the resulting list for that position. The function effectively handles tuples of varying string length and structure, returning a list where the length matches the number of strings in the tuple.
