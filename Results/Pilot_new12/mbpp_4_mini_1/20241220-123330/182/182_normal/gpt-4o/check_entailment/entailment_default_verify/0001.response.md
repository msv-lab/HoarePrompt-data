Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate since the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` extracts the last character of each string in a tuple, which aligns with the problem requirement. The provided assertions cover a range of test cases, confirming its correctness in returning a list of last characters.

The output hints further support this correctness by stating that if any string in the tuple is empty, an empty string is returned appropriately. The function behaves correctly for various input scenarios, and the confirmation on edge cases supports the initial assessment that the program handles the task as intended without any exceptions or errors for valid input tuples. Therefore, the final conclusion remains that the program meets the described requirements adequately.
