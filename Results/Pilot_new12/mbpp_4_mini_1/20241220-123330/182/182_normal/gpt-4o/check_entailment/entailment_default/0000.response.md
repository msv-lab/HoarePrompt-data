The function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. According to the problem description, it should return a list of these last characters and handle cases where some strings might be empty.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
```

The code uses a list comprehension to generate a list where each element is the last character of the respective string in the tuple `tup`. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where any string in the tuple is empty. If a string `s` is empty (`""`), trying to access `s[-1]` will result in an `IndexError` since there are no characters to access.

The output hints mention that if any string in the tuple is empty, an empty string will be included in the resulting list for that position. However, the current implementation does not provide this functionality, hence it contradicts the output hints and the problem description. 

### Example of Failure Case
For instance, if we call `func_1(('', 'test', ''))`, the function would raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the last character of an empty string, which does not exist.

Correctness: **False**.
