Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate. The function `func_1` successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description by extracting the last character of each string in the provided tuple.

The annotated code provides clear evidence that:
1. The function operates on a tuple of strings, as described.
2. The list comprehension correctly accesses and collects the last character (`s[-1]`) from each string `s` within the tuple `tup`.
3. There is a nuanced understanding in the annotations regarding the handling of empty strings, which is that it will include an empty string in the output list if any string is empty. This edge case also aligns with the assumption of valid input, as the function is designed to handle this appropriately.

Moreover, all three assertions provided in the code are accurately justified, confirming that the program behaves correctly for the given test cases. The reasoning from the original assessment substantiates that the function actively performs as expected and there are no indications of missing scenarios that would compromise its integrity.

Therefore, having considered all aspects, including the provided annotations and the problem description, the final assessment remains valid.
