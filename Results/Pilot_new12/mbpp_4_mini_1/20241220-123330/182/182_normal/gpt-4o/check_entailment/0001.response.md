Correctness: **True**

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The implementation uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character using negative indexing (`s[-1]`). 

The provided assertions test a variety of cases including different words and lengths, all of which are handled correctly. The function would also work with any tuple containing strings, regardless of their lengths, as it always accesses the last character.

To further confirm correctness, we can consider other cases:
1. If the input is `('', 'test', 'case')`, it would return `['', 't', 'e']` which is appropriate because it's extracting the last character of the empty string as well.
2. For single-character strings like `('a', 'b', 'c')`, it would return `['a', 'b', 'c']`, which is also correct.

Since no edge cases or potential failures were identified, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all tested scenarios.
