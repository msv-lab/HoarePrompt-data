Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when any string in the tuple is empty. According to the output hints, if any string in the tuple is empty, an empty string should be included in the resulting list for that position. However, the current implementation using `s[-1]` for empty strings will raise an `IndexError` because there is no last character in an empty string.

For example:
```python
assert func_1(('', 'hello', '')) == ['', 'o', '']
```
This case would cause the program to fail since it tries to access the last character of an empty string. Therefore, the program does not meet the specified requirements for every potential case.
