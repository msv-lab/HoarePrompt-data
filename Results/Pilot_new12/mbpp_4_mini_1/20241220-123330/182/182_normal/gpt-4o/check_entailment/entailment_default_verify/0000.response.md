Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(tup)` successfully extracts the last character from each string in the given tuple `tup`, as confirmed by the assertions provided. The analysis of the output hints indicates that the function is designed to return a list of last characters, including handling empty strings appropriately by including an empty string in the result when necessary. Since the program performs correctly under the described conditions, handling a variety of string lengths and returning results that match the expected output as stated in the problem description, the assessment of correctness remains valid. Therefore, the program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
