Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately follows the problem description, which requires extracting the last character from each string in a given tuple. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Expected Output**: The output of the function is a list that contains the last character of each string in the provided tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and collects the last character `s[-1]`.

3. **Tests Provided**: The assertions provided check multiple test cases:
   - For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the expected output is `['s', 'r', 's']`, and the function correctly produces this.
   - For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the expected output is `['e', 'r', 'e']`, which matches the function's output.
   - For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the expected output is `['a', 't', 'o']`, confirming the function works as intended.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and the tests confirm its correctness across different cases, it does what is expected consistently. Thus, the result is that the program is correct.
