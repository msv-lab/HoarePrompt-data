Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and extracts the last character from each string, returning a list of these characters. This meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept a tuple of strings. It's stated that input will be valid, and since the program does not need to handle any invalid cases (like empty strings beyond the description), it aligns with the assumptions.

2. **Logic of Extraction**: The main logic of the function is the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]`, which correctly retrieves the last character (`s[-1]`) from each string in the tuple `tup`. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to extract and return only the rear (last) index element of each string.

3. **Empty Strings**: The function also accounts for the presence of empty strings. If `tup` contains an empty string, the expression `s[-1]` would not raise an error (given that valid input is assumed), resulting in an empty string being added to the resulting list for that position.

4. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list, which is exactly what is specified in the problem description.

Overall, the implementation fulfills the criteria laid out in the problem description, ensuring correctness throughout.
