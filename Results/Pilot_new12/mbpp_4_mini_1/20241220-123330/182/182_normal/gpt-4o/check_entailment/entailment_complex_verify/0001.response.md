Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The program, through the function `func_1`, correctly extracts the last character of each string from a tuple, as confirmed by the assertions provided. 

The annotations provide a clear understanding of the function's behavior, including how it handles empty strings and different string lengths, which aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description. The logic of accessing the last character using `s[-1]` is implemented correctly, and the program is designed to handle a valid input, as assumed.

No edge cases were identified that would invalidate the function's correctness, and the variety of tests demonstrates the program's full capability. Therefore, the final assessment remains consistent, confirming that the program meets the problem requirements effectively.
