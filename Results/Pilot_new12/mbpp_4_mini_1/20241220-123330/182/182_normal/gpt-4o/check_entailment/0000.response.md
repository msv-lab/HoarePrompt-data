Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the provided tuple. Let's analyze it against the problem description:

1. For the tuple `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the last characters are 's', 'r', and 's', resulting in the list `['s', 'r', 's']`.
2. For the tuple `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the last characters are 'e', 'r', and 'e', resulting in the list `['e', 'r', 'e']`.
3. For the tuple `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the last characters are 'a', 't', and 'o', resulting in the list `['a', 't', 'o']`.

The list comprehension used in the function iterates over each string in the tuple, correctly accesses the last character with `s[-1]`, and builds the resulting list. There are no edge cases indicated in the problem description that the current implementation fails to address. Thus, overall, the code behaves as expected for these test cases and likely others, such as when provided with empty strings or strings of varying lengths. Hence, the correctness assertion stands true.
