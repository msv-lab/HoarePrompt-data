The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, an empty string will be included in the resulting list for that position. The function effectively handles tuples of varying string length and structure, returning a list where the length matches the number of strings in the tuple.
