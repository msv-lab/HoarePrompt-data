Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `strings`, which is a tuple of strings, and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` since it attempts to access the last character without handling empty strings. Thus, to fully capture the function's behavior, it is necessary to acknowledge that it may fail when given empty strings as input.
