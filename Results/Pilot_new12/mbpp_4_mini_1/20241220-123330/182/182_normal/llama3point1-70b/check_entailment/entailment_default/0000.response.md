Explanation: The code is attempting to extract the last character from each string in a tuple called `strings`. The output hints clearly state that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. Since the problem description does not mention any handling for empty strings and the hints highlight that the code fails under this condition, it shows that the function does not meet the requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
