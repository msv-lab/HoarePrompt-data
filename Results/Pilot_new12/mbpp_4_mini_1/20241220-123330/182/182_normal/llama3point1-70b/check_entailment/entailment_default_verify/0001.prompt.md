You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. It uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input tuple `strings` and returns a list of the last characters from each string using the index `-1`, which refers to the rear index of the string.

Possible edge cases:
1. The input is an empty tuple `()`, resulting in an empty list `[]`, which is expected.
2. The input contains strings of varying lengths, including:
   - An empty string `("")`, which would correctly yield an empty list since there's no last character.
   - Strings with a single character (e.g., `("a",)`) will yield that character.
   - Normal strings (e.g., `("hello", "world")`) will yield their respective last characters `['o', 'd']`.

The code handles all cases provided in the problem description without missing any logic or edge cases. Therefore, it is functionally correct based on the requirements stated.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `strings`, which is a tuple of strings, and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` since it attempts to access the last character without handling empty strings. Thus, to fully capture the function's behavior, it is necessary to acknowledge that it may fail when given empty strings as input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
