Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the given tuple and handles various edge cases appropriately. The annotations also confirm that at the point right before the function executes, the input is a valid tuple of strings, and the output will be a list of the last characters from each string. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the assessment, confirming the program's correctness.
