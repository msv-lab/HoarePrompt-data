Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle empty strings correctly. If any of the strings in the tuple `strings` is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character (s[-1]). The problem description does not specify that the input strings will always be non-empty, and thus, this is a failure case for the program. 

In summary, while the function does extract the last character from each string in the given tuple, it can fail and raise an exception when encountering an empty string, which is a scenario that should be addressed to fully comply with the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
