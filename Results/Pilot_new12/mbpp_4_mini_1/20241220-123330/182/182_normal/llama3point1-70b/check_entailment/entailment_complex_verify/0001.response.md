To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the annotations and the initial assessment, we first note the behavior described in the problem description.

Problem description: The function is required to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. 

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**  
The assessment states that the program will correctly extract the last character from each string in the provided tuple and handles edge cases appropriately, such as an empty input tuple, single-character strings, and normal strings. 

In the annotated version of the code, it specifies:
- **Functionality clarification**: The function aims to return the last character of each string.
- **Potential issue**: If any string is empty, an `IndexError` will occur.

Based on the annotations, we can infer that while the function may generally behave correctly (for non-empty strings), it will indeed raise an error when faced with empty strings, which was not covered in the original assessment.

The annotations indicate that if an empty string is included in the tuple, the function will fail:
- Thus the claim that it will handle all edge cases as stated in the original assessment is incomplete because it does not consider the case of empty strings appropriately.

Considering these observations, the final conclusion is that the program does not meet the problem description completely because it can raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, despite the program's functionality working correctly for many inputs, it fails to handle the edge case of empty strings adequately.

Final: **False**
