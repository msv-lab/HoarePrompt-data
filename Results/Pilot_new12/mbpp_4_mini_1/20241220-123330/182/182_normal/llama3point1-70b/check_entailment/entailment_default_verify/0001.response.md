The original assessment stated that the program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple. It highlighted handling of various edge cases, such as empty tuples and strings of varying lengths, concluding that the function is functionally correct.

However, the output hints suggest that the program does not handle empty strings properly. If the input tuple contains any empty string, the program will indeed raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access the last character. This means that while the program may function as intended in many cases, it fails to account for the case when an empty string is present in the input, which is a critical requirement in the problem description.

Thus, the assertion that the program is correct is undermined by this oversight. Since the program is expected to manage all edge cases described in the problem statement, including the handling of empty strings, the original assessment lacks coverage of this aspect.

Final: **False**
