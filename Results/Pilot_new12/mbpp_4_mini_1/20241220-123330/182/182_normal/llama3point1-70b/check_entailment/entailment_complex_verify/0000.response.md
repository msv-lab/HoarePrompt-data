Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program attempts to extract the last character from each string in a tuple, but it does not handle empty strings. As noted, if an empty string is encountered, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `s[-1]`. The annotated version confirms this behavior by highlighting that the function does not manage empty strings and that this lack of handling could lead to runtime errors. Therefore, considering both the problem description and the annotations, the function cannot be deemed correct due to the potential for errors with empty string inputs.
