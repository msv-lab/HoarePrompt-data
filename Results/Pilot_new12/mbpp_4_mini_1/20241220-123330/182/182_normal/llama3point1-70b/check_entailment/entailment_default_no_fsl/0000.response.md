Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to extract the last character from each string in a tuple of strings. However, it does not handle the case where one or more strings in the tuple may be empty. As highlighted in the output hints, if an empty string is present in the input, the program will raise an `IndexError`, since it tries to access the last character of a string without ensuring that the string is non-empty.

For example, if the input tuple is `("", "hello", "world")`, the program will raise an error when trying to access `s[-1]` for the first string, which is empty. This behavior indicates that the program does not fulfill the requirement of correctly processing every potential case defined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
