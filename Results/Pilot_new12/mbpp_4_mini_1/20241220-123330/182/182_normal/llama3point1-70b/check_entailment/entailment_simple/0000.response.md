Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and uses a list comprehension to extract the last character (rear index element) of each string. This meets the specification of the problem accurately.

1. The input is assumed to be a tuple of strings, as stated in the annotated comment above the function.
2. The expression `s[-1]` correctly retrieves the last character of each string `s` in the tuple.
3. The function compiles these last characters into a list and returns it, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Since the function performs these actions correctly for any valid tuple of strings, it consistently meets the requirements provided in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
