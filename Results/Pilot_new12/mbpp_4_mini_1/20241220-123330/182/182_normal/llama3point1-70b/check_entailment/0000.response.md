Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. However, it does not handle the case where a string in the tuple is empty. For instance, if the input tuple is `("", "hello", "world")`, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `s[-1]` for the empty string `""`. Since it fails to account for this edge case, the implementation is incorrect.
