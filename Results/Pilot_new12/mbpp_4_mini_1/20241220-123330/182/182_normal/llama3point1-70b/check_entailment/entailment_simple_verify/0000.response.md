The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **False** because the program does not handle the case where a string in the tuple is empty, which would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character of an empty string. This reasoning is sound, as the problem description specifies that the goal is to extract the last character of each string in the tuple. An empty string does not have a last character, leading to the aforementioned error.

The annotations confirm that the program simply attempts to return the last character of each string in the provided tuple. Since one of the potential inputs could be an empty string, the function proceeds to access `s[-1]` without any error handling, which aligns with the original assessment of the program being incorrect due to this oversight.

Considering these points, the original assessment accurately reflects the program behavior in relation to the problem description. 

Final: **False**
