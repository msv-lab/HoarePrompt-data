Correctness: **True**

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. It uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input tuple `strings` and returns a list of the last characters from each string using the index `-1`, which refers to the rear index of the string.

Possible edge cases:
1. The input is an empty tuple `()`, resulting in an empty list `[]`, which is expected.
2. The input contains strings of varying lengths, including:
   - An empty string `("")`, which would correctly yield an empty list since there's no last character.
   - Strings with a single character (e.g., `("a",)`) will yield that character.
   - Normal strings (e.g., `("hello", "world")`) will yield their respective last characters `['o', 'd']`.

The code handles all cases provided in the problem description without missing any logic or edge cases. Therefore, it is functionally correct based on the requirements stated.
