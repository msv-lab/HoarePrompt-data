The problem description specifies that the function is meant to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. The provided program attempts to do just that by using the expression `s[-1]`, which retrieves the last character of the string `s`. However, the original assessment accurately identifies a critical flaw in the program related to handling empty strings.

The output hints reiterate this flaw, clearly stating that the program will raise an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty. This means the function does not correctly handle all valid inputs as defined by the problem description, specifically those involving empty strings. 

Since the program does not account for edge cases such as empty strings and can lead to runtime errors, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, making the original assessment correct.

Given all the evidence provided and the reasoning applied, the final assessment of the program's correctness is as follows:

Final: **False**
