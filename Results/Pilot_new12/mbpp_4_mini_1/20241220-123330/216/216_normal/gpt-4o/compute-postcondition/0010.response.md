Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, and `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 3 elements. If the difference between the second element and the third element of `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without a return statement.***
