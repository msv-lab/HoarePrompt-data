The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is currently empty. If the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function returns `False`. The function also contains additional cases where it returns `False` without specifying their conditions. Finally, if all consecutive pairs of elements in the sorted list `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating successful verification of this condition. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return whether all consecutive elements differ by exactly 1 while handling empty lists and other conditions that may result in `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns True if all consecutive pairs of elements in the sorted list differ by exactly 1; otherwise, it returns False for other conditions.**
