The variable `lst_sorted` is assigned the value of `sorted(lst)`, which means `lst_sorted` becomes a sorted version of the list `lst`. The state of the list `lst` is not altered, and since it is not empty, `lst_sorted` will also contain the same integers as `lst` but in sorted order. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.**
