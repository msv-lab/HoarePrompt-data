Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements. If the loop completes all iterations without returning False, then all consecutive pairs of elements in `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and retains `lst_sorted` as the sorted version of `lst` with its original arrangement.**
