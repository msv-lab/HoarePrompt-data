According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst_sorted` is known to have at least 2 elements, meaning `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2. Therefore, the length of `lst_sorted` is at least 2, and `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is at least 1, which permits the loop to run for another iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `i` must be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, which is satisfied since `1 < len(lst_sorted) - 1` if `len(lst_sorted) > 2`. The difference between the second element and the first element of `lst_sorted` remains the same as no new elements are added or modified in the array.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. The difference between the second element and the first element of `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.**
