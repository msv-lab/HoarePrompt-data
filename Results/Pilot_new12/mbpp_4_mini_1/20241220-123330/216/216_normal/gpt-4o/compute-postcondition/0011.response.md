According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, inclusive, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. Since `lst_sorted` has at least 3 elements, `len(lst_sorted) - 1` will be at least `2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `len(lst_sorted) - 2` (the maximum value it can reach in the current loop execution). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, which is within the bounds for the loop but will not exceed them. Thus, we can set `i` to this value.

So, we now need `i` to be `len(lst_sorted) - 1` for the loop to run the next time. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.**
