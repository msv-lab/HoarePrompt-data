According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst_sorted`. The loop will execute if `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is at least 1, which implies that `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2. Since `lst` is not empty, it is guaranteed that `lst_sorted` will have at least one element. However, to ensure that the loop executes, we must have at least 2 elements in `lst_sorted`. So, for the loop to be executed, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, and initially, the value of `i` is 0 since the loop starts with `i = 0`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
