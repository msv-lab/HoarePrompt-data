The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `lst` is empty; if it is, the function returns False. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and checks whether every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list differs by exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, it returns False. If the list has less than two elements, the function directly returns True, as there are no consecutive pairs to check. Ultimately, the function returns True if all consecutive pairs differ by exactly 1, otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases include: handling of lists with only one element (returns True) and lists that contain duplicate integers (at least one duplicate means no consecutive pairs would differ by 1, resulting in a return of False).
