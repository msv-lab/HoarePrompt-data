#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list 'lst' is currently empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements. If the loop completes all iterations without returning False, then all consecutive pairs of elements in `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and retains `lst_sorted` as the sorted version of `lst` with its original arrangement.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all consecutive pairs of elements in the sorted list `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `lst` is empty; if it is, the function returns False. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and checks whether every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list differs by exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, it returns False. If the list has less than two elements, the function directly returns True, as there are no consecutive pairs to check. Ultimately, the function returns True if all consecutive pairs differ by exactly 1, otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases include: handling of lists with only one element (returns True) and lists that contain duplicate integers (at least one duplicate means no consecutive pairs would differ by 1, resulting in a return of False).
