Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` does check for consecutive numbers correctly in most cases, but it fails in one important scenario. Specifically, while the output hints mention that the function should return True for lists with less than two elements, the implementation of the code does not explicitly handle this case. The current implementation will return True for a list with a single element (like [1]), but it will also return True for an empty list. According to the problem description, an empty list should return False, as it lacks consecutive members. Additionally, the presence of duplicates will lead to a return of False, which is correctly handled. Hence, the function does not cover all potential edge cases properly, particularly the distinction of empty lists. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
