The original assessment indicated that the program's correctness is **False** based on the claim that the function `func_1` fails with negative numbers and mixed numbers, specifically highlighting the case where the input could be `[-1, 0, 1]`. 

Upon examining the original program and its behavior per the annotated version, we see that:

1. The function correctly handles non-empty lists and sorts them.
2. The loop checks adjacent numbers in the sorted list to ensure they differ exactly by one.
3. The program appropriately handles initial cases as verified by the assert statements provided.

However, the original assessment raises a valid concern regarding the handling of negative numbers and mixed sequences. The current implementation does consider negative numbers, as it sorts the list before checking for consecutive numbers. Thus, the input `[-1, 0, 1]` should return `True`, which matches the definition of "consecutive".

Yet, the original concerns correctly point out that if the list contains gaps, such as `[-1, 0, 1, 3]`, the function should return `False`, which it would correctly do since `1` and `3` do not differ by one. 

Therefore, the function's logic has aligned with the expected behavior as described in the problem statement, which is to identify consecutive numbers accurately under the assumption of purely valid input types (lists of integers). 

Thus, given all of this information, I conclude that the observations in the original assessment about the failure on certain inputs are mitigated by the annotated explanation and thorough logic of the function, which appears correctly defined for the described problem.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness based on a complete understanding of its behavior and the problem description is:

Final: **True**
