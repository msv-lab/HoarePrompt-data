Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers as described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Handling Empty Lists:** The function first checks if the list `lst` is empty. If it is, it returns `False`, which aligns with the expectation that a list without any elements cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting:** The function sorts the list, which is essential for checking whether the numbers are consecutive. By sorting the list, it ensures that elements are compared in the correct order.

3. **Checking Consecutiveness:** The `for` loop iterates through the sorted list, comparing each element with the next one. The condition `if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1` checks if two consecutive numbers differ by exactly 1, which is the requirement for the numbers to be consecutive.

4. **Handling Duplicates:** The logic inherently accounts for duplicates. If any two consecutive elements are the same (e.g., if the list contained a number and its duplicate), the difference would be 0, and the function would return `False`, as there are no distinct consecutive numbers.

5. **Single Element Lists:** If the list contains only one element, the condition in the loop doesn't execute because there are no pairs to compare. In this case, the function would also correctly return `True`, as there are no consecutive numbers to violate the requirement.

Overall, the function comprehensively checks for all scenarios described in the problem while adhering to the specified logical flow. Therefore, the implementation correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description.
