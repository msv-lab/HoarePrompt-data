You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` fails for the case where the list contains negative or mixed numbers. For example, the input `[-1, 0, 1]` should return `True` because those numbers are consecutive, but the function does not check for this scenario correctly. 

Additionally, it fails to identify cases where the input list contains both positive and negative consecutive numbers as a valid consecutive set. For instance, the input `[0, 1, 2, 3]` should return `True`, but if the input had gaps like `[-1, 0, 1, 3]`, it should return `False`, which the current implementation may also mishandle since it relies solely on the difference of 1 between sorted adjacent numbers.

Overall, the function does not account for all scenarios involving negative numbers and mixed sequences effectively.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `lst` is empty; if it is, the function returns False. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and checks whether every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list differs by exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, it returns False. If the list has less than two elements, the function directly returns True, as there are no consecutive pairs to check. Ultimately, the function returns True if all consecutive pairs differ by exactly 1, otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases include: handling of lists with only one element (returns True) and lists that contain duplicate integers (at least one duplicate means no consecutive pairs would differ by 1, resulting in a return of False).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
