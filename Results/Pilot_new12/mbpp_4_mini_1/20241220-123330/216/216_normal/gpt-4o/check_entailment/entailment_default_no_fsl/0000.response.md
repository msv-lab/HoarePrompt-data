Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case where the input list contains only one element correctly. According to the output hints, it states that a list with less than two elements should directly return True. However, the provided assertion tests do not cover this case, and if we test it with a single-element list like `func_1([1])`, it will return `True`, which is indeed correct. But it does not explicitly confirm this handling in the assertions, leading to incomplete coverage.

More importantly, the function does not correctly handle lists with duplicates. Although it is mentioned that the presence of duplicates will lead to a return of False, the assertions do not fully explore the implications of duplicates. For example, if we test `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])`, this should return False as there are duplicates present, but the assertion does not cover this.

Therefore, since the program fails to verify the behavior consistently across all potential edge cases and lacks adequate test coverage, we conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
