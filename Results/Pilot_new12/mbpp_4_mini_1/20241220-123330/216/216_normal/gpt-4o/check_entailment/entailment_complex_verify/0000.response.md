Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program against the problem description. The program successfully implements the required functionality of checking whether the provided list contains consecutive integers.

1. **Correct Handling of Edge Cases**: The function correctly returns `False` for an empty list, `True` for lists with consecutive integers, and `False` for lists with gaps or duplicates, which aligns with the defined requirements in the problem description.

2. **Logical Flow**: The annotations provide a clear understanding of the program's state at various points, confirming that the sorting and checking of consecutive differences operate as intended.

3. **Consistent Results**: The examples provided through assertions confirm the function's reliabilityâ€”those inputs lead to expected outputs without errors.

Overall, the annotated version reinforces the reasoning that the function adheres to its purpose and effectively handles all specified scenarios. Thus, the conclusion that the program's correctness is supported holds, leading to the final assessment of **True**.
