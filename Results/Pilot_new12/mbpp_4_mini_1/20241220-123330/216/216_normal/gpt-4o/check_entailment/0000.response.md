To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it fulfills the problem description of checking whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

### Program Analysis

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

### Potential Cases Analysis

1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False`, which is logically correct as there are no consecutive numbers in an empty list.
2. **List with Consecutive Numbers**: For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`, which is correct.
3. **List without Consecutive Numbers**: For example, `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`, which is correct since 4 is missing.
4. **List with Duplicates**: The case `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`, which is also appropriate as there are no consecutive sequences.
5. **Non-Consecutive but Presented in Random Order**: For example, the input `[3, 1, 2]` should still return `True` since the sorted version `[1, 2, 3]` contains consecutive numbers. The program handles this correctly.

### Edge Cases

- **Negative Numbers**: The list `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, when sorted, would be `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, which are consecutive if considering the entire range. The function should return `True`, which it does.
- **Non-Consecutive with Gaps**: The input `[1, 3, 4]` should return `False`, and it does.
- **List with a Single Element**: A list like `[5]` should return `True`, meaning it considers a single number as consecutive by itself. The function actually returns `True`, which is acceptable since there are no gaps when thereâ€™s only one element.

Given all the checks and considerations, there do not appear to be any potential input cases where the described function does not work as specified in the problem.

### Final Conclusion

As there are no identified flaws based on the description and edge cases considered, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because the function consistently checks for the condition of having consecutive numbers across various scenarios; it properly handles edge cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
