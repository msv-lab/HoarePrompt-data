Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` fails for the case where the list contains negative or mixed numbers. For example, the input `[-1, 0, 1]` should return `True` because those numbers are consecutive, but the function does not check for this scenario correctly. 

Additionally, it fails to identify cases where the input list contains both positive and negative consecutive numbers as a valid consecutive set. For instance, the input `[0, 1, 2, 3]` should return `True`, but if the input had gaps like `[-1, 0, 1, 3]`, it should return `False`, which the current implementation may also mishandle since it relies solely on the difference of 1 between sorted adjacent numbers.

Overall, the function does not account for all scenarios involving negative numbers and mixed sequences effectively.
