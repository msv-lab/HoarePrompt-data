The program provided correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Let's evaluate how the program meets the requirements in the problem description step by step:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The program first checks if the list `lst` is empty. If it is, the program returns `False`, which is appropriate since an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `lst` using `sorted(lst)`. This step is crucial because it arranges the elements in increasing order, allowing for a straightforward check of consecutive numbers.

3. **Consecutive Number Check**: The program iterates through the sorted list and checks each pair of adjacent numbers to see if their difference is 1. If any adjacent pair does not differ by 1, it returns `False`.

4. **Returning True for Consecutive Lists**: If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the program returns `True`, indicating that all numbers in the list are consecutive.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided `assert` statements test the function against various scenarios:
   - `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` should return `True` (all numbers are consecutive).
   - `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` should return `False` (5 is missing, hence not consecutive).
   - `[1, 2, 1]` should return `False` (the number 1 is repeated, so they cannot be consecutive).

Each aspect of the program aligns with the requirements stated in the problem description, and it effectively handles all potential cases that arise from the input being a valid list of integers.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
