You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it fulfills the problem description of checking whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

### Program Analysis

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

### Potential Cases Analysis

1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False`, which is logically correct as there are no consecutive numbers in an empty list.
2. **List with Consecutive Numbers**: For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`, which is correct.
3. **List without Consecutive Numbers**: For example, `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`, which is correct since 4 is missing.
4. **List with Duplicates**: The case `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`, which is also appropriate as there are no consecutive sequences.
5. **Non-Consecutive but Presented in Random Order**: For example, the input `[3, 1, 2]` should still return `True` since the sorted version `[1, 2, 3]` contains consecutive numbers. The program handles this correctly.

### Edge Cases

- **Negative Numbers**: The list `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, when sorted, would be `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, which are consecutive if considering the entire range. The function should return `True`, which it does.
- **Non-Consecutive with Gaps**: The input `[1, 3, 4]` should return `False`, and it does.
- **List with a Single Element**: A list like `[5]` should return `True`, meaning it considers a single number as consecutive by itself. The function actually returns `True`, which is acceptable since there are no gaps when thereâ€™s only one element.

Given all the checks and considerations, there do not appear to be any potential input cases where the described function does not work as specified in the problem.

### Final Conclusion

As there are no identified flaws based on the description and edge cases considered, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because the function consistently checks for the condition of having consecutive numbers across various scenarios; it properly handles edge cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list 'lst' is currently empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements. If the loop completes all iterations without returning False, then all consecutive pairs of elements in `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and retains `lst_sorted` as the sorted version of `lst` with its original arrangement.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all consecutive pairs of elements in the sorted list `lst_sorted` differ by exactly 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It first checks if `lst` is empty; if it is, the function returns False. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and checks whether every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list differs by exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, it returns False. If the list has less than two elements, the function directly returns True, as there are no consecutive pairs to check. Ultimately, the function returns True if all consecutive pairs differ by exactly 1, otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases include: handling of lists with only one element (returns True) and lists that contain duplicate integers (at least one duplicate means no consecutive pairs would differ by 1, resulting in a return of False).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
