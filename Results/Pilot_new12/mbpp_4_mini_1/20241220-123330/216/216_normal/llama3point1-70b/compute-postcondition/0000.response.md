`lst.sort()` sorts the list of integers `lst` in place, changing the order of the elements within `lst` to be in ascending order. Since the initial state indicates `lst` is a list of integers but does not specify any values, we can only convey that `lst` is now sorted. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`lst` is a sorted list of integers.**
