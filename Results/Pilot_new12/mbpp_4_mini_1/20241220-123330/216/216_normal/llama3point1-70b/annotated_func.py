#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive integers without duplicates, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list in-place and checks two conditions: whether the integers in `lst` are consecutive (meaning each integer is exactly one greater than the previous) and whether there are any duplicates (by comparing the length of `lst` to the length of the set made from `lst`). The function returns True if both conditions are met, indicating that `lst` contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False. Edge cases include an empty list, which will return True (as there are no elements to conflict), and a list with a single element, which will also return True. If the list contains numbers that are not consecutive or has duplicates, it will return False. However, note that if `lst` contains negative integers, the function does not account for whether they are consecutive with respect to zero; it simply checks the order in the sorted list.
