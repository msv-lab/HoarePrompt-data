The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list in-place and checks two conditions: whether the integers in `lst` are consecutive (meaning each integer is exactly one greater than the previous) and whether there are any duplicates (by comparing the length of `lst` to the length of the set made from `lst`). The function returns True if both conditions are met, indicating that `lst` contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False. Edge cases include an empty list, which will return True (as there are no elements to conflict), and a list with a single element, which will also return True. If the list contains numbers that are not consecutive or has duplicates, it will return False. However, note that if `lst` contains negative integers, the function does not account for whether they are consecutive with respect to zero; it simply checks the order in the sorted list.
