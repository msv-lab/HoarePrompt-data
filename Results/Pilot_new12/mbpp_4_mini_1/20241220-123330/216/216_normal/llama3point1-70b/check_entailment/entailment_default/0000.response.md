The provided program appears to address the requirements of the problem description. It checks for consecutive integers in a given list `lst`, ensuring that each integer in the sorted list is exactly one greater than the previous one and that there are no duplicate integers.

1. The sorting step organizes the numbers in increasing order.
2. The check for consecutive numbers verifies if each number differs from its predecessor by exactly one, utilizing a generator expression within the `all()` function.
3. The length comparison with the set ensures that there are no duplicates.

Regarding the edge cases:
- An empty list returns `True`, which aligns with the requirement since there are no elements to conflict.
- A single-element list also returns `True`, as there are no other elements to compare against.
- The function does handle negative integers correctly regarding consecutive checking, as it compares values directly (e.g., `-3, -2, -1` are consecutive).

The output hints confirm that if duplicates exist or if numbers are not consecutive, the function returns `False`, which also seems coherent.

However, I noticed a potential issue: the presence of a list that includes non-consecutive integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 4]`) will return `False`, which is correct. But, if we have numbers that are consecutive but not starting from 1, it will still return `True` (e.g., `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]` is considered consecutive). The hints did not explicitly mention this aspect, and there could be cases where the understanding of "consecutive numbers" might differ based on context (e.g., should they be strictly positive).

Nevertheless, the implementation accurately fulfills the problem requirements stated and checks all necessary conditions.

Thus, Given the evaluation, my conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
