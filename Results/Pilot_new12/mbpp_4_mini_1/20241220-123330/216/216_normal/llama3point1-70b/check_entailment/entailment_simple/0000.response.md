Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s how it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorting the List**: The function first sorts the list `lst`. Sorting is necessary to easily check for consecutive numbers, as consecutive numbers will have a difference of exactly 1 when sorted.

2. **Check Consecutiveness**: The function uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check that for every consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list, the difference between each element and its predecessor is exactly 1. This ensures that every element is consecutive to the next.

3. **Check for Duplicates**: The function checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list. Using a set effectively removes duplicates, so this condition guarantees that all numbers in `lst` are unique.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` only if both the conditions (consecutiveness and uniqueness) are met. If either condition fails, it returns `False`. 

Thus, if a list contains consecutive integers without duplicates, the program will correctly return `True`, and if it contains any gaps or duplicates, it will return `False`. Therefore, the program behaves as specified in the problem description for all potential valid inputs.
