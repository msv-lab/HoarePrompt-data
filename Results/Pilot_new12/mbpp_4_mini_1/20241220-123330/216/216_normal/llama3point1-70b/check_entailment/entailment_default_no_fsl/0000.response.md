Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the function will return `True` for an empty list and a list with a single element, which is acceptable based on the output hints. However, there is a critical flaw when considering negative integers. The program checks for consecutive integers, but it fails to consider the general definition of consecutive numbers that could overlap with zero. For instance, if the input list is `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, this list contains numbers that are consecutive when considering the entire integer range, but the function will incorrectly return `False` since the elements will not be incrementing as per the sorted indices.

Thus, the program does not account for all scenarios of consecutive integers correctly, leading to its classification as incorrect.
