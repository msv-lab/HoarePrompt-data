Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies issues with the implementation of the function `func_1(lst)`. The function indeed handles certain cases well, such as checking for duplicates and whether the list contains consecutive integers when sorted. However, it fails to address the ambiguity surrounding the treatment of edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists. Both cases return `True`, which may not align with a strict interpretation of what it means to contain consecutive numbers, since an empty list has no numbers at all and a single element isn't considered consecutive with respect to a range of numbers.

The program's behavior regarding negative integers also creates room for confusion, as it does not consider their consecutive nature in relation to zero. The output hints clarify that there are scenarios where the function can return `True` (e.g., for both an empty list and a single-element list), which could lead to misunderstandings about the expectations set forth by the problem description.

Given these considerations, the assessment concludes that the implementation does not fulfill the requirement of correctly determining if the list contains consecutive numbers in all situations. Therefore, the final correctness of the program remains as **False**.
