To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The function `func_1(lst)` aims to check whether the list contains consecutive numbers. 

### Breakdown of the Function:
1. **Sorting:** The input list is sorted. This is necessary to properly evaluate consecutive numbers.
  
2. **Checking Consecutiveness:**
   - The function uses the `all` function to iterate through the sorted list from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between each element and the previous element is exactly 1.
   - Additionally, it checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list. This condition ensures that there are no duplicates (since duplicates would cause a failure in the consecutiveness).

### Potential Problem Cases:
1. **Empty List:** 
   - An empty list technically contains no numbers, and it does not have any consecutive numbers â€” the expected output here can vary based on interpretation. The current implementation returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition for being consecutive.

2. **Single Element List:**
   - Similar to the empty list case, a single element list (e.g., `[5]`) is effectively "consecutive" because there are no other numbers to compare against.

3. **Negative and Positive Numbers:** 
   - A list containing both negative and positive numbers (e.g., `[-1, 0, 1]`) would output `False` since they are not consecutive in a strict sense.

4. **Non-consecutive but adjacent numbers:** 
   - Lists like `[1, 3, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 3]` and correctly return `True`, but `[1, 2, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 2]`, thus correctly returning `False`.

### Evaluation:
Given that the current implementation might consider handling an empty list and a single element list as valid cases for "having consecutive numbers," this can stray from a commonly expected interpretation of the problem. 

Since the handling of edge cases results in ambiguities about the emptiness and uniqueness of list elements, potential divergent interpretations can lead to different conclusions about "consecutiveness."

Thereby, the function can be seen as not fully addressing every potential case as intended by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

**Explanatory Note:** While many sample cases work as expected, the handling of empty lists and single-element lists can lead to incorrect assumptions about what constitutes "consecutiveness," leading us to conclude that the implementation has logical gaps according to the specifications.
