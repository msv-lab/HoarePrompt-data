To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate it against the problem description, which states that the function should check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()  # Sorts the list
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the List**: The line `lst.sort()` arranges the list in ascending order, which is a valid step to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking Consecutiveness**: The expression `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))` checks if every pair of adjacent sorted numbers differs by 1. This is a correct method of identifying consecutive elements.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, which is also necessary for the numbers to be considered consecutive.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- An empty list `[]` should return `False` since there are no numbers to be consecutive.
- A single element list `[5]` should return `False`, as there are no other numbers to form a consecutive sequence.

Now, let's evaluate these cases to see if the function behaves as expected:

1. **Empty List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (no numbers present)
   - Actual Result: `len([]) == len(set([]))` evaluates to `True`, but `all()` will inquire on empty, resulting in `True`. Therefore, outcome is `True`.

2. **Single Element List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([5])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (not consecutive)
   - Actual Result: Similarly as with the empty list, `len([5]) == len(set([5]))` evaluates to `True`, but no pairs to check via `all()` results in `True`. Outcome is `True`.

3. **Negative Numbers**: 
   - Input: `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])`
   - Expected Result: `True` (consecutive)
   - Actual Result: This passes both conditions and returns `True` as expected.

4. **Non-Consecutive List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 4])`
   - Expected Result: `False`
   - Actual Result: The function correctly identifies it and returns `False`.

5. **Duplicate in List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (due to duplicate)
   - Actual Result: The condition verifies `False`. 

Based on this evaluation, the crucial issue arises when handling cases with zero or one element, which should return `False` but evaluates to `True` because of how `all()` behaves on empty iterables, leading to an incorrect outcome.

Thus the program does not correctly assess all potential input cases as requested in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
