You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The function `func_1(lst)` aims to check whether the list contains consecutive numbers. 

### Breakdown of the Function:
1. **Sorting:** The input list is sorted. This is necessary to properly evaluate consecutive numbers.
  
2. **Checking Consecutiveness:**
   - The function uses the `all` function to iterate through the sorted list from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between each element and the previous element is exactly 1.
   - Additionally, it checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list. This condition ensures that there are no duplicates (since duplicates would cause a failure in the consecutiveness).

### Potential Problem Cases:
1. **Empty List:** 
   - An empty list technically contains no numbers, and it does not have any consecutive numbers â€” the expected output here can vary based on interpretation. The current implementation returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition for being consecutive.

2. **Single Element List:**
   - Similar to the empty list case, a single element list (e.g., `[5]`) is effectively "consecutive" because there are no other numbers to compare against.

3. **Negative and Positive Numbers:** 
   - A list containing both negative and positive numbers (e.g., `[-1, 0, 1]`) would output `False` since they are not consecutive in a strict sense.

4. **Non-consecutive but adjacent numbers:** 
   - Lists like `[1, 3, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 3]` and correctly return `True`, but `[1, 2, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 2]`, thus correctly returning `False`.

### Evaluation:
Given that the current implementation might consider handling an empty list and a single element list as valid cases for "having consecutive numbers," this can stray from a commonly expected interpretation of the problem. 

Since the handling of edge cases results in ambiguities about the emptiness and uniqueness of list elements, potential divergent interpretations can lead to different conclusions about "consecutiveness."

Thereby, the function can be seen as not fully addressing every potential case as intended by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

**Explanatory Note:** While many sample cases work as expected, the handling of empty lists and single-element lists can lead to incorrect assumptions about what constitutes "consecutiveness," leading us to conclude that the implementation has logical gaps according to the specifications.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list in-place and checks two conditions: whether the integers in `lst` are consecutive (meaning each integer is exactly one greater than the previous) and whether there are any duplicates (by comparing the length of `lst` to the length of the set made from `lst`). The function returns True if both conditions are met, indicating that `lst` contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False. Edge cases include an empty list, which will return True (as there are no elements to conflict), and a list with a single element, which will also return True. If the list contains numbers that are not consecutive or has duplicates, it will return False. However, note that if `lst` contains negative integers, the function does not account for whether they are consecutive with respect to zero; it simply checks the order in the sorted list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
