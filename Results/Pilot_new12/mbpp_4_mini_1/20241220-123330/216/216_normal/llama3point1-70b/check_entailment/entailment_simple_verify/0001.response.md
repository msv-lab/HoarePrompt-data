Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified logical gaps in the implementation concerning the definition of "consecutive numbers." The program effectively checks for duplicates and evaluates the differences between sorted list elements for consecutiveness. However, it incorrectly interprets cases with an empty list and a single-element list as valid instances of consecutiveness. This ambiguity does not align with the problem description, which implicitly suggests that there should be at least two distinct elements to regard a list as containing consecutive numbers.

Thus, the annotations supporting that the function returns True for such cases do not sufficiently justify the conclusion that the implementation meets the problem's expectations for consecutiveness, leading to the overall assessment of correctness being **False**.
