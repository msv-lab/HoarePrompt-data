The original assessment correctly identifies key aspects of the function's behavior in relation to the problem description. However, the assessment also highlights significant issues regarding how the function handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

1. **Functionality of the Code**: The function correctly attempts to check for consecutive integers and duplicates, which aligns well with the problem description.

2. **Key Issues**:
   - For an empty list, `all()` will evaluate to `True`, and therefore `func_1([])` incorrectly returns `True`, whereas it should return `False`.
   - For a single-element list, `all()` again evaluates to `True`, causing `func_1([5])` to return `True`, which is incorrect since a single number cannot be part of a consecutive sequence.

3. **Annotated Code Consistency**: The annotations state that the function returns `True` for an empty list and a single-element list. This is contradictory to the fundamental requirement of checking for consecutive numbers and must be regarded as erroneous behavior.

The original assessment concludes that the function is incorrect based on these observations, which aligns with the additional perspective provided by the annotated code. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as it highlights the critical flaws in handling the edge cases.

Given these considerations:

Final: **False**
