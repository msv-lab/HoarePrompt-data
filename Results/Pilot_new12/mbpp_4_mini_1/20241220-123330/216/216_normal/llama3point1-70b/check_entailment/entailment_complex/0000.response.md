Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. While the function checks if the list contains consecutive integers and also ensures there are no duplicates, the problem description only asks to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It does not specify that the list must be devoid of duplicates, which is an additional requirement imposed by the program. 

For example, the list `[1, 2, 2, 3]` contains consecutive numbers but would return `False` because of the presence of duplicates, violating the originally stated requirement. Therefore, since the program adds this condition of eliminating duplicates, it does not strictly adhere to the problem statement as it stands. 

In summary, the program incorrectly interprets the requirement by introducing an unnecessary condition of uniqueness, which leads to incorrect behavior for certain valid input lists containing consecutive numbers.
