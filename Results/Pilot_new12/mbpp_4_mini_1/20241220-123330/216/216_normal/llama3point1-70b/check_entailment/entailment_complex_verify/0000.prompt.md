You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate it against the problem description, which states that the function should check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()  # Sorts the list
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the List**: The line `lst.sort()` arranges the list in ascending order, which is a valid step to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking Consecutiveness**: The expression `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))` checks if every pair of adjacent sorted numbers differs by 1. This is a correct method of identifying consecutive elements.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, which is also necessary for the numbers to be considered consecutive.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- An empty list `[]` should return `False` since there are no numbers to be consecutive.
- A single element list `[5]` should return `False`, as there are no other numbers to form a consecutive sequence.

Now, let's evaluate these cases to see if the function behaves as expected:

1. **Empty List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (no numbers present)
   - Actual Result: `len([]) == len(set([]))` evaluates to `True`, but `all()` will inquire on empty, resulting in `True`. Therefore, outcome is `True`.

2. **Single Element List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([5])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (not consecutive)
   - Actual Result: Similarly as with the empty list, `len([5]) == len(set([5]))` evaluates to `True`, but no pairs to check via `all()` results in `True`. Outcome is `True`.

3. **Negative Numbers**: 
   - Input: `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])`
   - Expected Result: `True` (consecutive)
   - Actual Result: This passes both conditions and returns `True` as expected.

4. **Non-Consecutive List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 4])`
   - Expected Result: `False`
   - Actual Result: The function correctly identifies it and returns `False`.

5. **Duplicate in List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Result: `False` (due to duplicate)
   - Actual Result: The condition verifies `False`. 

Based on this evaluation, the crucial issue arises when handling cases with zero or one element, which should return `False` but evaluates to `True` because of how `all()` behaves on empty iterables, leading to an incorrect outcome.

Thus the program does not correctly assess all potential input cases as requested in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive integers without duplicates, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list in-place and checks two conditions: whether the integers in `lst` are consecutive (meaning each integer is exactly one greater than the previous) and whether there are any duplicates (by comparing the length of `lst` to the length of the set made from `lst`). The function returns True if both conditions are met, indicating that `lst` contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False. Edge cases include an empty list, which will return True (as there are no elements to conflict), and a list with a single element, which will also return True. If the list contains numbers that are not consecutive or has duplicates, it will return False. However, note that if `lst` contains negative integers, the function does not account for whether they are consecutive with respect to zero; it simply checks the order in the sorted list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
