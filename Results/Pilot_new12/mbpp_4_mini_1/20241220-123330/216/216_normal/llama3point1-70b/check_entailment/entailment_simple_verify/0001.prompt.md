You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The function `func_1(lst)` aims to check whether the list contains consecutive numbers. 

### Breakdown of the Function:
1. **Sorting:** The input list is sorted. This is necessary to properly evaluate consecutive numbers.
  
2. **Checking Consecutiveness:**
   - The function uses the `all` function to iterate through the sorted list from the second element (index 1) and checks if the difference between each element and the previous element is exactly 1.
   - Additionally, it checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list. This condition ensures that there are no duplicates (since duplicates would cause a failure in the consecutiveness).

### Potential Problem Cases:
1. **Empty List:** 
   - An empty list technically contains no numbers, and it does not have any consecutive numbers â€” the expected output here can vary based on interpretation. The current implementation returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition for being consecutive.

2. **Single Element List:**
   - Similar to the empty list case, a single element list (e.g., `[5]`) is effectively "consecutive" because there are no other numbers to compare against.

3. **Negative and Positive Numbers:** 
   - A list containing both negative and positive numbers (e.g., `[-1, 0, 1]`) would output `False` since they are not consecutive in a strict sense.

4. **Non-consecutive but adjacent numbers:** 
   - Lists like `[1, 3, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 3]` and correctly return `True`, but `[1, 2, 2]` will sort to `[1, 2, 2]`, thus correctly returning `False`.

### Evaluation:
Given that the current implementation might consider handling an empty list and a single element list as valid cases for "having consecutive numbers," this can stray from a commonly expected interpretation of the problem. 

Since the handling of edge cases results in ambiguities about the emptiness and uniqueness of list elements, potential divergent interpretations can lead to different conclusions about "consecutiveness."

Thereby, the function can be seen as not fully addressing every potential case as intended by the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

**Explanatory Note:** While many sample cases work as expected, the handling of empty lists and single-element lists can lead to incorrect assumptions about what constitutes "consecutiveness," leading us to conclude that the implementation has logical gaps according to the specifications.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive integers without duplicates, and False otherwise.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
