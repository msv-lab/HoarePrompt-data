The variable `nth_column` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that extracts the `n`th element from each row in the `matrix`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, it ensures that `nth_column` will contain valid elements from the matrix. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists of numbers; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]); `nth_column` is a list containing the `n`th elements from each row in `matrix`.**
