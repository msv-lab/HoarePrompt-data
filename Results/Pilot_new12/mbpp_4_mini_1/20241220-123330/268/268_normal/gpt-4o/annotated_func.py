#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the `nth_column`, which contains the `n`th elements from each row in the `matrix`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists representing a 2D array of numbers, and a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer specifying the index of the column to be evaluated. It returns the maximum value found in the `n`th column of `matrix`. In scenarios where `matrix` is empty or if `n` exceeds the maximum index of the columns in `matrix`, the function may throw an error (such as an IndexError) since these edge cases are not explicitly handled in the code.
