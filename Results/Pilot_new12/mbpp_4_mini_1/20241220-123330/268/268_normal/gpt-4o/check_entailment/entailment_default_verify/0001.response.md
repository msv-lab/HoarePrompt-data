Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle edge cases such as an empty matrix or when the column index `n` is out of range. The output hints confirm that such scenarios could lead to potential errors, specifically an `IndexError`, which further supports the conclusion that the function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, given the lack of error handling for these cases, the assessment that the program is incorrect remains valid.
