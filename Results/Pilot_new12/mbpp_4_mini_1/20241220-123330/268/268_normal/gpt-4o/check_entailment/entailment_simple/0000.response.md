Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n`, which indicates the column from which the maximum value is to be retrieved.

Hereâ€™s how it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a matrix (list of lists) and a non-negative integer `n`. The problem description guarantees that valid inputs will be provided, specifically that `n` is within the bounds of the column indices of the matrix.

2. **Extracting the Column**: Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to construct `nth_column`, which contains the `n`th element from each row of the matrix. This adheres to the requirement of accessing the `n`th column.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: The program then uses the built-in `max()` function to find and return the maximum value from the `nth_column`. This directly addresses the requirement to return the maximum value from the specified column.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided are sufficient to validate the functionality for various inputs, confirming that the function operates correctly for the specified cases.

The implementation is efficient and follows the problem statement closely, ensuring that it meets the expectations laid out. Thus, the program is considered correct.
