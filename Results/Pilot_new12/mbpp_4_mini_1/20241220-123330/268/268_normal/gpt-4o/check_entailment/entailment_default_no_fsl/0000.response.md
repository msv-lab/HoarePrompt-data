Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases where the input matrix is empty or the index `n` exceeds the maximum column index. For instance:

1. If the input matrix is empty (e.g., `matrix = []`), `func_1([], 0)` would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `row[n]` because there are no rows to access.
2. If `n` is greater than the number of columns in the matrix (e.g., for `matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n = 2`), the same `IndexError` would occur because there is no third column (index 2).

These edge cases indicate that the function may produce errors at runtime, thus it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
