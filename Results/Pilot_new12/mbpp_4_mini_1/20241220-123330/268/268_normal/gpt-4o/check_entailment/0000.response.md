To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its behavior based on the problem description.

**Problem description:** Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` is intended to extract the nth column from the given matrix and return the maximum value from that column.
2. The assertions provided test the function with valid inputs, and they pass.
3. However, we need to consider edge cases:
   - If the `n` index is out of bounds for any of the rows, the program will raise an `IndexError`.
   - If the matrix is empty or if all rows of the matrix contain fewer than `n + 1` columns, the function will not handle this case properly either.

**Potential failing case:**
- For example, if we call `func_1([], 0)`, it will throw an `IndexError` because there are no rows in the matrix.
- If the matrix is `[[1], [2], [3]]` and `n` is `1`, the program will also raise an `IndexError` because there is no second column.

Given these considerations, the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is out of bounds or when the matrix is empty.

**Final assessment:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails with certain inputs, such as an empty matrix or when `n` exceeds the column range of the provided rows.
