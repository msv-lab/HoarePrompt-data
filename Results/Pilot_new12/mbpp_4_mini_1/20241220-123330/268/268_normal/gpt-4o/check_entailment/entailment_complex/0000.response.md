Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's the explanation:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n` representing the column index. Its purpose is to return the maximum value found in the `n`th column of the matrix.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The program correctly extracts the `n`th column from the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`. This creates a new list containing all elements from the `n`th column.
   - It then correctly finds and returns the maximum value from this list using the built-in `max` function: `return max(nth_column)`.

3. **Assumptions**: 
   - The problem description assumes that the input will always be valid. This means that the matrix is non-empty and that `n` is always a valid index (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). The code does not handle invalid inputs, but since it's stated that we are assuming valid inputs, this is acceptable.
   - The assertions provided also serve to demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in the valid scenarios presented.

4. **Function Behavior**: For any valid inputs as defined by the problem description, the function will correctly output the maximum of the specified column, meeting the requirements set forth.

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and fulfills its intended purpose in all specified scenarios, confirming its correctness.
