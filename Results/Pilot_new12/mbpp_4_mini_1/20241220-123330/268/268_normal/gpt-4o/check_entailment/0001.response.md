To determine the correctness of the function `func_1` as described in the problem statement, we need to analyze the implementation and identify potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function is supposed to return the maximum value from the `n`th column of a given matrix. The provided assertions suggest that the function is expected to work correctly for specific inputs.

2. **Matrix Structure**: The function processes a matrix (a list of lists), extracting the `n`th column and returning the maximum value found in it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Index Range**: What happens if the column index `n` is out of the range of the columns in the matrix? If `n` is greater than the number of columns in any of the rows, this would raise an `IndexError`.
   - **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty, the function should ideally handle this scenario. Currently, it would also raise an `IndexError` if an empty matrix is provided along with a column index.
   - **Single Row or Single Column**: While the function should work with these cases, it's important to confirm that the logic handles these appropriately.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an example where `n` is out of range:
  ```python
  # An example where n is out of range
  func_1([[1, 2, 3]], 3)  # IndexError because there is no 3rd column
  ```

- For testing an empty matrix:
  ```python
  # An example with an empty matrix
  func_1([], 0)  # IndexError, as the matrix is empty
  ```

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the specified column index `n` is out of range or where the matrix is empty, leading to possible `IndexError`s. Therefore, the function is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
