The provided program is designed to find the maximum value of the nth column in a given matrix. The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension to extract the nth column and then applies the `max()` function to find the maximum value.

According to the output hints, while the function works correctly for valid cases, it does not handle potential edge cases, such as when the matrix is empty or when `n` exceeds the number of columns present in the matrix. In these cases, the function would throw an `IndexError`, indicating that it can fail under certain conditions, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

For example, if we call `func_1([], 0)` (an empty matrix) or `func_1([[1, 2]], 2)` (an attempt to access a column index that does not exist), the function will raise an error instead of returning a value.

Therefore, the program fails to cope with these important edge cases, resulting in it being deemed incorrect overall.

Correctness: **False**.
