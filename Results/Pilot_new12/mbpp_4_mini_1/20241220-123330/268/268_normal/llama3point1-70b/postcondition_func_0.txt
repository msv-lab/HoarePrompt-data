The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the `matrix`. If `n` is 0, it will produce an error because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the rows of the matrix. The assumption is made that `matrix` is non-empty, and `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). If these conditions are not met, the function may raise an IndexError or behave unexpectedly.
