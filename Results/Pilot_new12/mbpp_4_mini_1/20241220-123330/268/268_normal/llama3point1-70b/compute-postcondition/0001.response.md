The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a 2D list (list of lists) of integers, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if the matrix is non-empty. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the 2D list `matrix`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, and return the maximum value from the column indexed by (n-1) of the given matrix. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, returning the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the matrix.**
