To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the function based on the provided problem description, which states that we need to return the maximum value of the n-th column from a matrix represented as a list of lists.

The provided function is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Indexing**: 
   - The program uses `n - 1` to access the n-th column. If `n` is 1, it accesses index 0, which is correct. However, if `n` is greater than the number of columns in any of the rows or if `n` is less than 1, this will raise an `IndexError`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Matrix**: If `matrix` is empty, calling `max()` will raise a `ValueError` because there are no elements to find a maximum from.
   - **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If not all rows in the matrix have at least `n` columns, accessing `row[n - 1]` could again lead to an `IndexError`.

3. **Type Checking**:
   - The function does not validate whether the elements in the matrix are all numeric types suitable for comparison with `max()`. If any non-numeric value is in the n-th column, it will throw a `TypeError` when trying to compute the maximum.

### Potential Issues:

- If `n` is less than 1, or if it is greater than the number of columns in the matrix, it results in an `IndexError`.
- If the matrix is empty, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError`.
- The function does not handle matrices with inconsistent row lengths or non-numeric values.

Based on these observations, I can conclude that the program does not correctly handle these cases.

Correctness: **False**

### Reason:
The function will raise exceptions in multiple scenarios:
- An empty matrix raises a `ValueError`.
- If `n` is out of the valid range (less than 1 or greater than the length of any row), it will throw an `IndexError`.

Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description under all potential inputs.
