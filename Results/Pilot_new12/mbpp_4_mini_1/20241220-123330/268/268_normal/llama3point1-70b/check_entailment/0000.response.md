To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
- The function should return the maximum value of the nth column from a matrix represented as a list of lists.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Parameter Processing**: The function takes `matrix` (a list of lists) and `n` (an integer representing the column index).
2. **Column Indexing**: The function uses `n - 1` to access the (n-1)th index of each row, as Python uses 0-based indexing. This means the first column corresponds to `n = 1`.
3. **Finding Maximum**: It calculates the maximum of the specified column using a generator expression iterating through each row.

### Potential Issues:
- **Column Index Out of Range**: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any of the rows in the matrix, the program will raise an `IndexError`. The problem description does not specify how to handle such cases (i.e., if `n` is invalid).
- **Empty Matrix**: If the input is an empty matrix, attempting to access any column will also lead to an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation does not handle edge cases properly, such as invalid column indices and empty matrices, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

This program fails for input cases such as:
- `func_1([], 1)` will result in an `IndexError`.
- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0)` will also result in an `IndexError` due to invalid column index.
