Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identified potential issues in the function, such as `IndexError` and `ValueError` scenarios due to invalid inputs. However, the annotated version clarifies that we are assuming the input will be valid, specifically that `n` is a non-negative integer within the correct range and that the matrix is properly formed with consistent row lengths.

Given the assumptions provided in the annotation, the program is designed to fulfill the requirement of returning the maximum value in the n-th column of a well-formed matrix. The function successfully calculates the maximum value from a specified column index as long as valid inputs are guaranteed. 

Therefore, under the conditions specified in the annotations, the program correctly meets the problem description. Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is **True**.
