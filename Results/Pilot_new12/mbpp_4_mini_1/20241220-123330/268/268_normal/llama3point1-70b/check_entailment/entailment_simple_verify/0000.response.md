Based on the annotations provided and the reasoning from the original assessment, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that returns the maximum value in the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

2. **Program Implementation**: 
   ```python
   def func_1(matrix, n):
       return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
   ```

3. **Annotated State**: The annotations clarify that the program is expected to work under the assumption that `n` is a non-negative integer fulfilling the conditions `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` if the matrix is non-empty. This means the function will only be called with valid input where the column index `n` corresponds correctly to the columns in the matrix.

4. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment pointed out potential issues such as an `IndexError` for out-of-range indices or empty matrices. However, based on the annotations, it is assumed that the inputs will always be valid as per the given constraints.

5. **Final Consideration**: 
   - Given that the annotations support the correctness by specifying valid inputs for the function, the original assessment's concern about the edge cases (invalid indices and empty matrices) is excluded from consideration. The program then effectively meets the requirements set out in the problem description, assuming proper input validation has already been assured. 

Finalizing these points, I conclude that the program is indeed correct under the defined assumptions.

Final: **True**
