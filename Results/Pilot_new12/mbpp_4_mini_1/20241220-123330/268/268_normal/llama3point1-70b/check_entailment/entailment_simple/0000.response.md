Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. According to the description, the function should return the maximum value from the `n`th column (0-based) of the provided matrix. However, the program currently attempts to access the `(n-1)`th column instead of the `n`th column. This would lead to an incorrect result when `n` is greater than 0 since it effectively shifts the indexing by one position backward.

For example, if we have the following matrix:
```
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
```
If we call `func_1(matrix, 2)`, it should return `6` (the maximum of the second column `[2, 5, 8]`), but the program will instead try to access the first column (index `1`), returning `5`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the current implementation fails to properly meet the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
