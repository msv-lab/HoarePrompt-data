Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when `n` is 0, which would result in an IndexError when attempting to access `row[n - 1]` since it would be trying to access `row[-1]` from the rows in the matrix. Additionally, there is an assumption made that `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])), but this is not enforced in the code. If `n` is greater than the number of columns present in any of the rows in the `matrix`, it would also cause an IndexError.

For example:
- Calling `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0)` would raise an error since it tries to access an invalid index.
- Calling `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)` would also raise an error if there are fewer than 3 columns.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle every potential case as described.
