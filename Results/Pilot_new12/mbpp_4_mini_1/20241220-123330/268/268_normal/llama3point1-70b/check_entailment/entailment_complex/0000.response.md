Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should return the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix. However, the provided code attempts to return the maximum value from the (n-1)th column instead. This is a deviation from the requirement because it alters the expected column index:

- In the problem description, if `n` is given as 1, it should refer to the first column (0th index).
- The code instead interprets `n` as 0 corresponding to the first column, hence accessing `row[n - 1]` is incorrect.

For instance, if the user provides a column index of 1 (indicating the first column), the code actually accesses `row[0]`, which is not the intended functionality according to the problem description.

As such, the implementation is incorrect and does not fulfill the requirements as outlined.
