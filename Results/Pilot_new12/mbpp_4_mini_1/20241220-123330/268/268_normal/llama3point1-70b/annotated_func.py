#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list (list of lists) of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is non-empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the 2D list 'matrix'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column of the `matrix`. If `n` is 0, it will produce an error because it tries to access an index that does not exist in the rows of the matrix. The assumption is made that `matrix` is non-empty, and `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). If these conditions are not met, the function may raise an IndexError or behave unexpectedly.
