The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` was 1, so after the execution, `k` becomes 2. The other values remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the number of digits in `triangular_number` is not equal to `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the number of digits in `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
