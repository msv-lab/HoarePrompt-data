In this case, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, there's no need to adjust any state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the number of digits in `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**.
