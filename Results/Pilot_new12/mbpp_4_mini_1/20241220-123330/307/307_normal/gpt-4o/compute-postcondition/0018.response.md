The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, in Case_1, the function returns the value of `k`, which is 1. In Case_2, it returns the value of `k`, which is 2. In Case_3, it returns the value of `k`, which is 3. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and potentially return different values of `k` based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns the value of k as 1, 2, or 3 based on specific cases.**
