The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Here, `k` is 3. Therefore, the calculation becomes `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `3 * 4 // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`. The value of `triangular_number` changes to 6. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
