Output State: **`k` is the smallest integer such that `triangular_number` (which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`) has `n` digits, `n` is a positive integer, and the loop will continue until `k` reaches this value, meaning that the triangular number corresponding to the original value of `k - 1` does not have `n` digits.**
