The variable `k` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Since `n` is a positive integer, it continues to hold its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1**
