The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state, where `k` is 2, the calculation performed is 2 * (2 + 1) // 2, which results in 3. The previous value of `triangular_number` was 1. The states of the other variables, `n` and `k`, remain unaffected. Additionally, the condition that the number of digits in `triangular_number` is not equal to `n` still holds because `triangular_number` has changed from 1 to 3, and we assume `n` is a positive integer different from 1 and 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the number of digits in `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
