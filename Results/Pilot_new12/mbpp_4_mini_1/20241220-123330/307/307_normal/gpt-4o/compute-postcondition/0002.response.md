`triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, the calculation results in `triangular_number` being equal to 1 * (1 + 1) // 2, which equals 1. The values of `n` remain unchanged as it does not affect the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `triangular_number` is 1.**
