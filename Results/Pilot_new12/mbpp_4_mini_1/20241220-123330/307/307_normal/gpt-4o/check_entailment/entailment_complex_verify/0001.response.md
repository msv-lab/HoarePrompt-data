The original assessment of the program's correctness is that it is **False** due to the inadequacy of the function in handling the case where `n = 1`.

After analyzing the provided program, the problem description, and the annotated version, it is apparent that the function `func_1(n)` indeed fails to compute and return the correct index for `n = 1`, where the smallest triangular number is `1` corresponding to \( T_1 \). 

The code logic iterates through integers `k` to compute triangular numbers, but as confirmed by the annotations and the original assessment reasoning, there is no entry or handling for `n = 1`, which yields an absence of a return value (it defaults to returning `None`). As such, this creates a gap that prevents the function from being complete and correct according to the specification in the problem description.

Furthermore, the annotations reinforce this aspect, indicating that while the program calculates triangular numbers and seeks to determine indices correctly for certain digit scenarios, it lacks coverage for all cases, specifically `n = 1`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final determination of the correctness of the program stands:

Final: **False**
