You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(n)` which is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

A triangular number is defined by the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), where `k` is a positive integer. The program has a loop that calculates triangular numbers and checks if the number of digits in each triangular number matches `n`. The index (or value of `k`) of the first triangular number that has exactly `n` digits is returned.

Let's break down the potential cases to check its correctness:

1. When `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number with 1 digit is `1` (which corresponds to \( T_1 \)). The expected output is `1`.
2. When `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is `10` (which corresponds to \( T_4 = 10 \)). The expected output is `4`.
3. When `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105` (which corresponds to \( T_{14} = 105 \)). The expected output is `14`.
4. When `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `1001` (which corresponds to \( T_{45} = 1035 \)). The expected output would be `45`.
5. If we check `n = 5`, the smallest triangular number with 5 digits is `10010`, which corresponds to \( T_{141} = 10011 \). 

The program fails to handle cases when `n = 1` and should return `1`, but it has not been tested in the assertions provided. 

Since the program doesn't account for when `n = 1` correctly while also not including it in the assertions for testing, this means there exists at least one case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Thus, the final evaluation:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle the case for `n = 1` correctly as it would result in an incorrect return value, failing to meet the specifications of the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the smallest integer such that `triangular_number` (which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`) has `n` digits, `n` is a positive integer, and the loop will continue until `k` reaches this value, meaning that the triangular number corresponding to the original value of `k - 1` does not have `n` digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the smallest integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) contains exactly `n` digits. It returns the value of `k`. If no triangular number with exactly `n` digits can be found, the function does not have a defined exit since it contains an infinite loop that continues indefinitely. Consequently, the function relies on eventual termination when a valid `k` is found based on the size of `n` and may not return correctly for unusually high values of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
