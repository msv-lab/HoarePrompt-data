Correctness: **True**

The `func_1` implementation correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is designed to find the smallest index `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The triangular number for a given `k` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is appropriate and standard for computing triangular numbers.

3. **Digit Count Check**: The function converts the calculated triangular number to a string to determine its length, efficiently checking if it has exactly `n` digits using `len(str(triangular_number)) == n`.

4. **Incremental Search**: The function starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` progressively. This guarantees that all triangular numbers are considered, ensuring that the first triangular number with `n` digits is correctly identified.

5. **Termination**: The loop continues until a valid `k` is found, which demonstrates that the function correctly guarantees that it will return a valid index for any positive integer `n` that corresponds to a triangular number with `n` digits.

6. **Test Cases Validation**: The assertions provided serve to validate that the function behaves as expected for specific inputs (`n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`). The results returned by the function match known values for triangular numbers with those respective digit counts.

In summary, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description as it systematically explores possible triangular numbers and accurately identifies the first that has `n` digits, thus meeting the intended functionality.
