Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which asks for a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

Here's the breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function calculates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct since triangular numbers are defined as such.

2. **Digit Count Check**: Within an infinite loop, the function checks if the number of digits in the calculated triangular number equals `n` using `len(str(triangular_number)) == n`. This condition ensures that the function is specifically looking for triangular numbers with exactly `n` digits.

3. **Return the Index**: When it finds the first triangular number that satisfies the condition, it returns `k`, which correctly represents the index of that triangular number (where `k` is the count of terms contributing to that triangular number).

4. **Testing Assertions**: The assertions provided demonstrate the expected outputs for inputs of 2, 3, and 4 digits. The function correctly identifies that the 4th triangular number (10, which is the triangular number for `k=4`) has 2 digits, the 14th triangular number (105) has 3 digits, and the 45th triangular number (1035) has 4 digits, matching the assertions.

Overall, the function performs the required computation in adherence to the problem description, correctly identifying and returning the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Thus, the program is correctly implemented.
