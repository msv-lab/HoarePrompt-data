To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(n)` which is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

A triangular number is defined by the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), where `k` is a positive integer. The program has a loop that calculates triangular numbers and checks if the number of digits in each triangular number matches `n`. The index (or value of `k`) of the first triangular number that has exactly `n` digits is returned.

Let's break down the potential cases to check its correctness:

1. When `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number with 1 digit is `1` (which corresponds to \( T_1 \)). The expected output is `1`.
2. When `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is `10` (which corresponds to \( T_4 = 10 \)). The expected output is `4`.
3. When `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105` (which corresponds to \( T_{14} = 105 \)). The expected output is `14`.
4. When `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `1001` (which corresponds to \( T_{45} = 1035 \)). The expected output would be `45`.
5. If we check `n = 5`, the smallest triangular number with 5 digits is `10010`, which corresponds to \( T_{141} = 10011 \). 

The program fails to handle cases when `n = 1` and should return `1`, but it has not been tested in the assertions provided. 

Since the program doesn't account for when `n = 1` correctly while also not including it in the assertions for testing, this means there exists at least one case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.

Thus, the final evaluation:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle the case for `n = 1` correctly as it would result in an incorrect return value, failing to meet the specifications of the problem.
