Correctness: **False**.

The function is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. The triangular number is calculated using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), and the program checks for the length of the triangular number's string representation to determine if it has `n` digits.

However, there are some issues:

1. The program does not handle the case where `n = 1`. For `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number with 1 digit is 1 (the first triangular number).
2. The program does not validate or handle inputs less than 1, which could cause it to run indefinitely or produce unexpected results if an invalid or edge case input is provided.
3. The index returned by the function corresponds to the value of `k`, but as per the description referring to the index of the triangular number itself (starting at 1), the program aligns with the expectation for the provided test cases. However, it's unclear if the function is intended to return the correct k index or just any triangular number that meets the digit count criteria.

In summary, the function misses edge cases and thus cannot be considered correct in all potential scenarios.
