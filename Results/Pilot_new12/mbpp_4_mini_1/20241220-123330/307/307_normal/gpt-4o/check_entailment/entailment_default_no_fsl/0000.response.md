Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. However, the program does not handle the case where no triangular number with exactly `n` digits could theoretically exist for unusually high values of `n`. This is problematic because, although it may find a valid `k` for reasonable values of `n`, for very large values of `n`, the program enters an infinite loop without a defined exit condition. 

For instance, if we were to call `func_1(100)`, the algorithm will keep looping without returning a value since it will continue checking triangular numbers indefinitely, implying that it's not guaranteed to produce a result for inputs beyond a certain threshold, leading to a failure in fulfilling the problem's requirements. Thus, the function does not meet the requirement of definitively finding the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for every potential input as stipulated in the problem description.
