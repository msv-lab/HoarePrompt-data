The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the smallest integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) contains exactly `n` digits. It returns the value of `k`. If no triangular number with exactly `n` digits can be found, the function does not have a defined exit since it contains an infinite loop that continues indefinitely. Consequently, the function relies on eventual termination when a valid `k` is found based on the size of `n` and may not return correctly for unusually high values of `n`.
