#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the smallest integer such that `triangular_number` (which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`) has `n` digits, `n` is a positive integer, and the loop will continue until `k` reaches this value, meaning that the triangular number corresponding to the original value of `k - 1` does not have `n` digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the smallest integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) contains exactly `n` digits. It returns the value of `k`. If no triangular number with exactly `n` digits can be found, the function does not have a defined exit since it contains an infinite loop that continues indefinitely. Consequently, the function relies on eventual termination when a valid `k` is found based on the size of `n` and may not return correctly for unusually high values of `n`.
