Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. The triangular number for an index `idx` is calculated using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{idx \times (idx + 1)}{2} \). The function iterates starting from index 1, calculates the triangular number, and checks if the number of digits (length of the string representation) is greater than or equal to `n`. Once it finds such a triangular number, it returns the corresponding index `idx`.

The program correctly handles the following cases:
- For `n = 1`, it will find the triangular number 1 (which has 1 digit) at index 1.
- For `n = 2`, it will find the triangular number 10 (which has 2 digits) at index 4.
- For higher values of `n`, the function continues iterating until the condition is met.

The logic meets the requirements stated in the problem description without missing any cases or edge situations.
