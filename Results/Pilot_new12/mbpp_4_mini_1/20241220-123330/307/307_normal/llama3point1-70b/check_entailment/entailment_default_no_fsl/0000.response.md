Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle invalid inputs as mentioned in the output hints. While it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits when `n` is a positive integer, it does not check for or handle cases when `n` is zero or a negative integer. The output hints state that "the function may not handle invalid inputs," thereby indicating that there are potential cases (e.g., `n = 0`, `n = -1`) where the program will not behave correctly, as it will enter an infinite loop without returning an index.

Since the function is supposed to return the first index where the triangular number meets the digit criteria but fails to account for the input validity, it is deemed incorrect overall.
