Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. Here's how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function takes a positive integer `n`, which meets the requirement that the input should represent the number of digits in the triangular number.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This is the correct mathematical formula for generating triangular numbers.

3. **Digit Counting**: The function uses the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` to check if the newly calculated triangular number has at least `n` digits. This correctly implements the requirement to find the smallest index for triangular numbers with a specified number of digits.

4. **Looping Until Success**: The program employs an infinite loop which continues until it finds the appropriate `idx`. The `idx` is incremented on each iteration, ensuring that every possible index is considered until the condition is met.

5. **Output**: Once the condition of having at least `n` digits for a triangular number is satisfied, the function returns `idx`, which corresponds directly to the requirement of finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

The program does not need to handle invalid inputs or optimize for large values since it is stated that the input will always be valid, hence it fulfills the requirements set forth by the problem description. Thus, it is correct in producing the expected output for the given task.
