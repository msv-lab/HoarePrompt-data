The provided program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

Let's analyze the program and the output hints:

1. The program utilizes a loop to compute triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
2. It checks if the number of digits in the triangular number (converted to a string) is greater than or equal to `n`.
3. If it finds such a number, it returns the `idx`.

The output hints explain that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` where the triangular number has at least `n` digits. It acknowledges that the function may not handle invalid inputs, like non-positive integers, efficiently.

However, let's consider the edge cases:
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or negative. Although the assumption is made that the input will always be valid, the problem description clearly states it should be a positive integer. If an invalid input were provided, the function could potentially run indefinitely as it would continue searching for a triangular number but would never meet the condition.
  
In terms of triangular numbers:
- The first few triangular numbers are: 1 (1st), 3 (2nd), 6 (3rd), 10 (4th), 15 (5th), 21 (6th), 28 (7th), 36 (8th), 45 (9th), 55 (10th), 66 (11th), 78 (12th), 91 (13th), etc. 

For high values of `n`, the function works as expected according to the problem description.

Given that the program may fail for cases where `n <= 0`, thus not meeting the problem's full requirements, we determine that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
