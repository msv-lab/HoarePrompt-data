You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze what the problem is asking and how the code fulfills those requirements.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1
```

### Understanding the Code:
1. The code initializes `idx` to 1.
2. It enters an infinite while loop.
3. It calculates the triangular number for the current index using the formula: 
   \[
   T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
4. It checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number to see if it has at least `n` digits.
5. If the condition is satisfied, it returns the current index (idx).
6. If not, it increments the index and continues the loop.

### Cases to Consider:
The function will correctly run indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits due to the use of a while loop. The algorithm should be efficient enough because triangular numbers grow relatively quickly.

**Key Edge Cases to Consider:**
- For `n = 1`: The smallest triangular number is 1, which has 1 digit (T(1) = 1). The function should return `1`.
- For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number with at least 2 digits is 10 (T(4) = 10). The function should return `4`.
- For larger values of `n`, we want to ensure that the calculation continues correctly until we find such a triangular number.

### Testing the Function:
Let's consider `n = 3`:
- Triangular numbers: 
  - T(1) = 1
  - T(2) = 3
  - T(3) = 6
  - T(4) = 10
  - T(5) = 15
  - T(6) = 21
  - T(7) = 28
  - T(8) = 36
  - T(9) = 45
  - T(10) = 55
  - T(11) = 66
  - T(12) = 78
  - T(13) = 91
  - T(14) = 105 (has 3 digits)

The output should be `14` as T(14) = 105 is the first triangular number with 3 digits.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly addresses the problem and will return the appropriate index for any valid input `n` greater than or equal to `1`, I cannot find any edge cases where it fails. 

Thus, based on the analysis above:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to that index has at least `n` digits. It computes the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` in a loop until it finds an index where the number of digits (as determined by converting the triangular number to a string) is greater than or equal to `n`. The function may not handle invalid inputs (like a non-positive integer) or very large values efficiently but will ultimately return the first index where the triangular number meets the digit criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
