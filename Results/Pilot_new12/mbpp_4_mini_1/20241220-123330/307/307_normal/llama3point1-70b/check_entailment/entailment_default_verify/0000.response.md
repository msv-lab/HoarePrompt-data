Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It uses the standard formula for triangular numbers and checks the number of digits by converting the triangular number to a string. 

The output hints clarify that while the function may not handle invalid inputs (non-positive integers) or might not be efficient for very large values of `n`, these considerations do not affect the correctness of its primary functionality as stated in the problem description. The function successfully meets the requirements by returning the correct index for valid inputs and adheres to the described behavior. Hence, the final assessment confirms the program's correctness.
