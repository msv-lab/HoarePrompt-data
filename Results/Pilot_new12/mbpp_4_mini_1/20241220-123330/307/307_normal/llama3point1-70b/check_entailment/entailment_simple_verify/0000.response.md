The program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The triangular number is computed correctly using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{idx \times (idx + 1)}{2} \), and the loop continues until a triangular number with the desired number of digits is found. 

The annotations clarify the state of the program, confirming that before the loop begins, `n` is a positive integer, and after the loop, `idx` is correctly identified as the first integer for which the length of the triangular number's string representation is at least `n`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

The original assessment stated the program's correctness as **True**, and this assessment appears to be justified given the evidence extracted from the annotations. The function does not miss any cases regarding input handling since valid inputs are assumed.

Thus, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
