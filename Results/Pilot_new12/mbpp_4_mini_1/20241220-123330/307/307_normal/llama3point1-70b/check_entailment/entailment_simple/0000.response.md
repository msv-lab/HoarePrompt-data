Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Triangular Numbers Calculation**: The program calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is correct for generating triangular numbers.

2. **Checking the Number of Digits**: The program checks if the number of digits in the triangular number is at least `n` by converting the triangular number to a string and measuring its length with `len(str(triangular_num))`.

3. **Looping Until Condition is Met**: The while loop continues indefinitely until it finds the first triangular number with at least `n` digits. When it finds such a number, it returns the index `idx`.

4. **Positive Integer Assumption**: The assumption of valid input is acknowledged, meaning that `n` is always positive, which aligns with the problem description as it asks for a positive integer as input.

Overall, the program consistently finds the correct index according to the problem's requirements, thus it is correct.
