To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze what the problem is asking and how the code fulfills those requirements.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1
```

### Understanding the Code:
1. The code initializes `idx` to 1.
2. It enters an infinite while loop.
3. It calculates the triangular number for the current index using the formula: 
   \[
   T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
4. It checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number to see if it has at least `n` digits.
5. If the condition is satisfied, it returns the current index (idx).
6. If not, it increments the index and continues the loop.

### Cases to Consider:
The function will correctly run indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits due to the use of a while loop. The algorithm should be efficient enough because triangular numbers grow relatively quickly.

**Key Edge Cases to Consider:**
- For `n = 1`: The smallest triangular number is 1, which has 1 digit (T(1) = 1). The function should return `1`.
- For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number with at least 2 digits is 10 (T(4) = 10). The function should return `4`.
- For larger values of `n`, we want to ensure that the calculation continues correctly until we find such a triangular number.

### Testing the Function:
Let's consider `n = 3`:
- Triangular numbers: 
  - T(1) = 1
  - T(2) = 3
  - T(3) = 6
  - T(4) = 10
  - T(5) = 15
  - T(6) = 21
  - T(7) = 28
  - T(8) = 36
  - T(9) = 45
  - T(10) = 55
  - T(11) = 66
  - T(12) = 78
  - T(13) = 91
  - T(14) = 105 (has 3 digits)

The output should be `14` as T(14) = 105 is the first triangular number with 3 digits.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly addresses the problem and will return the appropriate index for any valid input `n` greater than or equal to `1`, I cannot find any edge cases where it fails. 

Thus, based on the analysis above:

Correctness: **True**
