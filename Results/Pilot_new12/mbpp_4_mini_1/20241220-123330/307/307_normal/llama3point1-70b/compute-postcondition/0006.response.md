In this case, the value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `idx` starts at 1. Thus, after executing `idx += 1`, the new value of `idx` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
