The value of `idx` is assigned to 1. Since no other variables are affected and the initial state remains unchanged except for `idx`, the output state reflects the current value of the variable `idx`. Therefore, the precondition about `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1**
