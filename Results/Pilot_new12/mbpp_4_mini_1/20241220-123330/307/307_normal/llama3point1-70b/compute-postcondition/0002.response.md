The value of `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is initialized to 1, `triangular_num` will be assigned the value of `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which results in `1`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged in this step. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
