`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The value of `idx` is 3, so the calculation is `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which results in `3 * 4 // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`. Since `triangular_num` was originally 6 and remains the same, the state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
