The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. The function evaluates triangular numbers and contains several cases of return values based on the conditions satisfied by these triangular numbers. 

In Case_1, the function returns `idx` which is 1, indicating the first triangular number meets or exceeds the specified number of digits `n`. In Case_2, the function returns `idx` which is 2. In Case_3, the function returns `idx` which is 3. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the index of the first triangular number that meets or exceeds the specified number of digits `n`, responding with indices 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns the index of the first triangular number with at least n digits. The index could be 1, 2, or 3 based on the triangular number's number of digits.**
