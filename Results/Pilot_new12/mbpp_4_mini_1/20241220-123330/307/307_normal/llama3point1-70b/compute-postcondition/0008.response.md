`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we can calculate `triangular_num` as follows: 

triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6.

Now, the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is '6') is definitely less than `n`, since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 (as stated in the initial state).

The values of `n`, `idx`, and the previously calculated length condition still hold. The change is only the value of `triangular_num`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 6; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
