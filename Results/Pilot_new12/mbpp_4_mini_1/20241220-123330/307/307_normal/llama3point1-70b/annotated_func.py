#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the first integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`, `triangular_num` equals `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to that index has at least `n` digits. It computes the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` in a loop until it finds an index where the number of digits (as determined by converting the triangular number to a string) is greater than or equal to `n`. The function may not handle invalid inputs (like a non-positive integer) or very large values efficiently but will ultimately return the first index where the triangular number meets the digit criteria.
