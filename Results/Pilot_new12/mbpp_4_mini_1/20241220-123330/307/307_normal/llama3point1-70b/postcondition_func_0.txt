The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to that index has at least `n` digits. It computes the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` in a loop until it finds an index where the number of digits (as determined by converting the triangular number to a string) is greater than or equal to `n`. The function may not handle invalid inputs (like a non-positive integer) or very large values efficiently but will ultimately return the first index where the triangular number meets the digit criteria.
