Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`, which must contain at least two elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If there are fewer than two unique integers, the function returns `None`. If there are two or more unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from this list, sorted in ascending order. The function does not handle cases where all integers in the input list are identical or where there are exactly two unique integers, resulting in returning just one unique integer. The overall state after the function runs will either be `None` or the second smallest unique integer from `nums`.**
