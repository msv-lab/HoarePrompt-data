The variable `unique_nums` is created by converting `nums` into a set to remove duplicates and then converting it back into a list. The original `nums` remains unaffected by this operation. As `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` will contain a list of integers that are unique and may have fewer elements than `nums`, depending on how many duplicates were present.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
