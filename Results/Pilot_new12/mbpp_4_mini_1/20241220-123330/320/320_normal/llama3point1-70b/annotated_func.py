#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that no unique integers are present in the list `nums` containing at least two elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list of unique integers derived from 'nums', sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`, which must contain at least two elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If there are fewer than two unique integers, the function returns `None`. If there are two or more unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from this list, sorted in ascending order. The function does not handle cases where all integers in the input list are identical or where there are exactly two unique integers, resulting in returning just one unique integer. The overall state after the function runs will either be `None` or the second smallest unique integer from `nums`.
