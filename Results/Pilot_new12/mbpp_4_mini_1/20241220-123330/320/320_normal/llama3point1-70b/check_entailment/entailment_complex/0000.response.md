Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function is meant to find the second smallest number in a list, but it first removes duplicate values by creating a list of unique integers. While the function intends to return the second smallest unique integer, it does not correctly handle cases where all integers in the input list are identical or when there are exactly two unique integers resulting in the function potentially returning a single unique integer.

Specifically, if the list contains two identical numbers (like `[1, 1]`), the function will eventually lead to an outcome where there is only a single unique integer. According to the code logic, it would then return `None`, which does not satisfy the requirement of returning the second smallest number. Instead, it should either return the second smallest number from the list of original numbers, rather than focusing primarily on unique numbers, or define more robust handling for such edge cases.

In case of input like `[1, 1, 2]`, although it would return `2` correctly, the program logic could fail in the case of two identical numbers thereby making it hard to always ensure it retrieves the second smallest number from the list as requested. Hence, it does not satisfy the requirement for all potential valid inputs as described.
