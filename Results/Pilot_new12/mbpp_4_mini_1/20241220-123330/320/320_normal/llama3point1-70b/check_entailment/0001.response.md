To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I'll evaluate how the program handles edge cases and potential inputs.

The function defined in the program, `func_1(nums)`, is supposed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here’s how it works:

1. It converts the `nums` list to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a list called `unique_nums`.
2. If the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, it returns `None`. This means that if there are fewer than two unique numbers in the original list, the program correctly handles it by not trying to find a second smallest number.
3. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element.

Let's explore potential cases where this function might not work as expected:

1. If the input list contains duplicates but still offers a valid second smallest number, the program handles it correctly as it transforms to a set first.
2. However, if the input list has only one unique number (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), it correctly returns `None`, indicating no second smallest exists.
3. For an empty list `[]`, the program would also return `None` as it has no unique numbers.
4. For a single element list (like `[5]`), it will also return `None`.

One potential edge case that reveals a flaw in the program's functionality is when there are negative numbers or zero involved. 

Consider the input: `[0, -1, -1, -2]`. 
- The function will convert this to the set `{0, -1, -2}` which gives `[-2, -1, 0]` when sorted.
- The second smallest number in this list is `-1`, and the function will return `-1`, which is the expected behaviour. It handles negative numbers correctly.

After reviewing this logic, I also tried to identify a gap in the process – for instance:
- `func_1([4, 4, 4, 4])`, which yields `None`.
- `func_1([3])`, which also yields `None`.
- Complex cases like `func_1([3, 1, 4, 2])`, which correctly identifies `2` as the second smallest.

Because I was not able to find a case in which the program behaves unexpectedly or does not follow the requirements (it appropriately handles duplicates, checks for length, and sorts successfully), I will conclude that the program is correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True** 

The function accurately identifies the second smallest number in various scenarios, including those with duplicates, edge cases with one or zero unique numbers, and negative numbers.
