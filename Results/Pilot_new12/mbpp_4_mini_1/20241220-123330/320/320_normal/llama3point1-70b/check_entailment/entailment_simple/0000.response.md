Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input list `nums` contains at least two integers. This is consistent with the problem description which states that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements.

2. **Unique Numbers Extraction**: The line `unique_nums = list(set(nums))` takes the input list and extracts only the unique integers. This step is important because the problem implies that the second smallest value should be drawn from distinct numbers.

3. **Early Return for Invalid Cases**: The program checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2 with `if (len(unique_nums) < 2)`. However, given that we assume `nums` has at least two elements, this condition will not trigger in typical valid input scenarios. This means the function won't return `None` for proper inputs, which is acceptable since we are working under the specifications provided.

4. **Sorting and Returning the Result**: The program then sorts the list of unique numbers and accesses the second smallest number using `sorted(unique_nums)[1]`. This operation retrieves the second smallest value as required.

5. **Assumptions on Input Validity**: The program operates under the assumption that the input is valid. If `nums` has less than two unique integers due to all numbers being the same, it does not account for this situation since the problem guarantees that the input will conform to the specified format.

Overall, since the program correctly identifies and returns the second smallest unique number from the input list, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
