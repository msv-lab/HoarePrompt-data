#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique integer from the sorted list 'unique_nums' if it contains more than one unique integer; if not, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and processes it to determine the second unique integer from the list. It first creates a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`. If this sorted list contains more than one unique integer, it returns the second unique integer; if there is only one unique integer or none, it returns None. This means that if `nums` contains duplicates or is made up of the same integer, the function will not return a second unique integer, thus covering edge cases such as all elements being the same or the list having only one unique element.
