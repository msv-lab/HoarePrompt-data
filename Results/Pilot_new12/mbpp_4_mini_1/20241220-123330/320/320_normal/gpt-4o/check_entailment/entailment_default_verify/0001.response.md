Final: **True** 

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` implements the required logic properly as per the problem description. It successfully identifies the second smallest unique number in a given list by removing duplicates and sorting the remaining values. The program handles various edge cases, including cases where all elements are the same, where it appropriately returns `None`. The output hints corroborate this functionality and accurately describe how the function behaves under different scenarios. Hence, the program satisfies the problem requirements and behaves as expected, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed correct.
