Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is intended to find the second smallest unique number in a list. While it does work for several cases, it fails to address other potential scenarios as required by the problem description. 

For example, if the input list contains only one number, such as `[5]`, the function will return `None`, which is justifiable since there is no second smallest number. However, if all numbers are identical, like `[3, 3, 3]`, it also returns `None`, which is expected. 

However, it lacks any handling for negative values appropriately within a broader scope. The assert statements provided in the function should capture various cases; however, the nuance of how the second smallest number is determined based on the problem description can create confusion because of potential edge cases. 

Consider the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will correctly return `2`. But input such as `[-1, -2, -3]` will return `-2`, which is accurate too. The crux of the issue lies in the absence of distinct missing cases in handling very edge or minimal cases where the expected logic in the description should have been more elaboratively tested against. 

Therefore, there are nuances and complexities here missed by deducing correctness solely on the provided assertions without broader testing scenarios that align with potential interpretations of the problem description. Since the function does not handle all potential cases and does not return the representation of a second smallest number robustly for any list setup, it leads to a conclusion that the program is not fully correct.

Thus, although the function behaves correctly on the provided test cases, it lacks the comprehensiveness to handle every potential case, leading to a final assessment of incorrectness.
