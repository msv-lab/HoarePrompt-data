Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the second smallest unique number in a list. 

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The annotated state of the program before the function call confirms that `nums` is always a list of integers with at least two elements, which aligns with the assertions provided that consider various scenarios relevant to the problem. 

2. The function correctly utilizes `set` to filter out duplicate values, returning only unique numbers, which maintains the integrity of finding the second smallest value based on the problem description.

3. The return statement efficiently checks if there are at least two unique values; if so, it retrieves the second smallest. If not, it correctly yields `None`, consistent with the given behavior in the assertion checks.

4. Each of the provided assertions has been validated by the annotated states, and all cases where duplicates exist or where there is a limited number of unique numbers are handled correctly.

Therefore, the annotations and the original assessment sufficiently support that the function behaves as intended based on the problem description.
