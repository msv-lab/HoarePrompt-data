Correctness: **False**

The provided implementation does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to find the second smallest number in a list. However, it returns `None` in cases where the second unique integer does not exist (i.e., when the list consists of all identical elements). This behavior is problematic because the requirement to find the "second smallest number" does not specify the need to return `None` if such a number does not exist.

The problem description implies that the function should always return the second smallest number if it exists. In cases where all elements are the same, it is not clear if the function is expected to return `None` or perhaps indicate that no second smallest exists in a different manner. The test cases given also reflect this ambiguity.

For example, the function would return `None` for inputs like `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`, which does not align with the expectation of identifying a second smallest value. Although the implementation handles unique values correctly, it fails to address the explicit requirement to find the "second smallest number."

Therefore, the solution does not satisfy the stated problem description in all cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
