Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly implement the requirement to find the second smallest number in the list according to the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Duplicates**: The function sorts the unique elements of the input list and retrieves the second element if it exists. This means that if all elements are the same, it returns `None` instead of correctly identifying that there is no second smallest number. However, it is still misleading because the function does not clearly convey that it is returning the second smallest unique number rather than simply the second smallest number in general.

2. **Correct handling of valid cases**: There are specific test cases (like `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`) where it returns `None`, which could be misleading since the input did have at least two elements but were duplicates. The expectation from the problem statement implies that if there's no second smallest number, it should indicate that clearly, whereas returning `None` may cause confusion on whether it was the correct execution for valid inputs. 

To correctly implement the requirement, the function should ideally return an error or a more appropriate indication that a second smallest cannot be determined when duplicates are present. In all cases, the program should provide accurate results based on definitions, which it does not.

Therefore, since it does not align with the problem description for all potential cases, it receives a "False" rating.
