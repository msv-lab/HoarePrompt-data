Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest unique number in a list, based on the provided problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Creating Unique Values**: The line `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` takes the input list and removes duplicates by converting it to a set, and then sorts the resulting unique numbers. This is appropriate for the problem description because it ensures that only unique values are considered when finding the second smallest number.

2. **Finding the Second Smallest**: The return statement `return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None` checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If so, it returns the second smallest number, which is at index 1 in the sorted list of unique numbers. If there is only one unique number (or none), it correctly returns `None`.

The provided assertions also cover various scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list with positive and negative numbers and returns the correct second smallest number.
- The second assertion checks a list with repeated values and correctly identifies `-0.5` as the second smallest.
- The third and fourth assertions check cases where all numbers are the sameâ€”these correctly return `None`, reflecting the absence of a second smallest unique number.

Since all relevant cases are handled correctly based on the problem description, the program is indeed correct.
