To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's first clarify what needs to be done based on the description: the function is intended to find the second smallest number in a list.

Let's break down the code:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

1. **Conversion to Set**: The code converts the input list `nums` to a set to eliminate duplicates, which is a logical way to ensure that we only consider unique numbers when determining the "second smallest."

2. **Sorting**: Next, the unique numbers are sorted. This allows us to easily find the second smallest number by accessing the index [1], provided there are at least two unique numbers.

3. **Returning the Result**: The function checks if the length of `unique_nums` is greater than 1. If it is, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Now, letâ€™s consider the assertions provided in the program to identify edge cases that may not be handled:

- Test case 1: `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` should return `-2`, which it does.
- Test case 2: `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])` should return `-0.5`, which it also does.
- Test case 3: `func_1([2, 2])` correctly returns `None` since there's only one unique number.
- Test case 4: `func_1([2, 2, 2])` correctly returns `None` for the same reason.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. What happens if the input list is empty? 
   - Calling `func_1([])` should ideally also return `None`, and indeed it will since `set([])` results in an empty set.

2. What if there are negative numbers and all are the same, let's say `[-1, -1, -1]`? 
   - This will also return `None` as it contains only one unique element `-1`.

3. A case with only one unique element: 
   - For instance, `func_1([4])` should return `None`.

### Edge Case Testing:
- Running `func_1([5])` or `func_1([])` output `None` is correct based on our condition of having at least two unique numbers.
- Testing with `func_1([-5, -5, -2])` should return `-2`, which it does correctly.

Since for all relevant cases that I've considered, the provided function behaves as expected and does not produce any false outputs for the problem's requirements:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function properly identifies the second smallest number in a list while handling edge cases related to duplicates, empty lists, and lists with insufficient unique values.
