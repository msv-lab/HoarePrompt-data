Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` processes the input list correctly by extracting unique numbers, sorting them, and then returning the second smallest number if it exists. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected and addresses all specified test cases effectively. Additionally, the function correctly returns `None` in cases where there are fewer than two unique integers, aligning perfectly with the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the assessment of correctness remains sound.
