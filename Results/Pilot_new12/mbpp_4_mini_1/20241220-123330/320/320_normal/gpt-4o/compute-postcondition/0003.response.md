Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and processes it to determine the second unique integer from the list. It first creates a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`. If this sorted list contains more than one unique integer, it returns the second unique integer; if there is only one unique integer or none, it returns None. This means that if `nums` contains duplicates or is made up of the same integer, the function will not return a second unique integer, thus covering edge cases such as all elements being the same or the list having only one unique element.**
