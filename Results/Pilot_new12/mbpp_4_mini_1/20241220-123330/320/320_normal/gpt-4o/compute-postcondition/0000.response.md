The code assigns `unique_nums` the value of the sorted list of unique integers from `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `set(nums)` will produce the unique elements from that list, and `sorted(set(nums))` will arrange these unique integers in ascending order. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `unique_nums`, while still indicating that `nums` remains a list of integers with at least two elements.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `nums`.**
