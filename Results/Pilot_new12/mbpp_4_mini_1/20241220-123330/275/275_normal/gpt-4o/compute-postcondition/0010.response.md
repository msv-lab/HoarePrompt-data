According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by the loop, which runs from `0` to `i-1`. The loop iterates over indices `j` that are less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index being processed and is greater than `0` because `nums` has at least 1 element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` in the outer loop (which is not shown), meaning it will be processing the next element in `nums`. To analyze it: 

- If the current value of `i` is `n`, the next loop iteration would need `j` to cover from `0` to `n-1`, so the next value of `i` used in the loop must be `n + 1`.
- Therefore, the next iteration must process an index of `j` that is less than `n + 1`, which means there must be at least `n + 1` elements in the `nums` list.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n + 1` elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1, `i` is `n + 1`.**
