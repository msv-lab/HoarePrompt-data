The value of `dp[i]` is updated by comparing its current value with `dp[j] + 1`. The output of this statement is that `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp` is initialized to a list where all elements are 1 and that `i` is currently 1, the previous value of `dp[i]` is 1. Since `dp[j]` is also initialized to 1, `dp[j] + 1` would equal 2, meaning `dp[i]` will likely be updated to 2. The values of `nums`, `dp`, and `i` are affected but not changed in a way that is not represented. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is now equal to max(1, 2) = 2 (assuming `dp[j]` is 1), and `i` is 1. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is 2, and `i` is 1.**
