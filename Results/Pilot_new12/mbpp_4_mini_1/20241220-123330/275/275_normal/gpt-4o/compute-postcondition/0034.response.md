According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, it depends on the variable `j` relative to `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 up to `i - 1`, which means that if `j` is currently 0, the loop can execute at least once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and since `j` starts at 0, it can potentially continue until `j` reaches `i - 1`. 

For this loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1 from its current value (which is 0), and since `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, we need to ensure that `j` is incremented sensibly within this context. Hence, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must now equal 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` is 1**
