To analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. `dp[i]` is assigned a new value, which is the maximum between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.
2. Since `j` is equal to `i`, we can understand that the calculation is comparing the value of `dp[i]` with `dp[i] + 1`.
3. Thus, the new value of `dp[i]` will either remain the same or increase by 1, depending on its current value.
4. The values of `nums` and other variables remain unaffected by this specific operation.

As the values of `dp[i]` depend on its previous value and `j`, we don't have specific numeric values, but we can describe the potential outcome based on these observations.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is updated where `dp[i]` is either the same or increased by 1 based on the maximum value between current `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + 1`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `i`.**
