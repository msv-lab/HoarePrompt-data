Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n + 1` elements, and `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
