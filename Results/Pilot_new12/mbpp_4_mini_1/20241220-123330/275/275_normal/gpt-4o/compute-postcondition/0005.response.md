According to the code, the loop will execute for each index from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. Hence, the loop will execute as long as `len(nums)` is greater than 0. The initial state shows that `nums` is a sorted list of integers and `dp` is initialized accordingly.

For the loop to be executed, `len(nums)` must be greater than 0, and the loop starts with `i` initialized to 0. At the start of the loop's first iteration, `i` will be 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` with all elements initialized to 1, `i` is 0**
