`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, it implies that `dp[j] + 1` will either maintain or possibly increase the value of `dp[i]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` starts at 0; `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`)**.
