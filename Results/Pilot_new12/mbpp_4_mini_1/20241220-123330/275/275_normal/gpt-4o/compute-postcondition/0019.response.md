Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list containing the size of the largest divisible subset for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` will start at 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
