Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is updated such that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is greater than 1, then `dp[i]` may be increased by 1 based on the maximum value between current `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
