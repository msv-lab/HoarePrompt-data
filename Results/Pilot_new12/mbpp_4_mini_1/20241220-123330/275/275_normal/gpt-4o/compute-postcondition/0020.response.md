In the provided code, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `dp` is a list containing the size of the largest divisible subset for each element in `nums`.
- `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which means `dp[i]` corresponds to an index beyond the last element of `dp`.
- At the current condition, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Since `i` equals `len(nums)`, it indicates that `dp[i]` does not exist because indexing in Python is zero-based. However, if we assume that `dp` includes a length that matches `i` and we work with the known logic, then we would be calculating a maximum in a context that might not normally apply, but under these assumptions, `dp[len(nums)]` would reference an out-of-bounds condition.

Thus, the valid condition here is:

- `dp[i]` is being set to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, which implies we take the existing value of `dp[i]` and determine whether a new, larger value could come from `dp[j]`.

Thus, the output will reflect:
- The state of `nums` is still a sorted list of integers.
- `dp` is still a list with the size updated where `dp[len(nums)]` is updated if the condition found a valid `j`.
  
The specific values cannot be known from the information provided alone, but we know an operation is taking place.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element; `dp` is a list modified such that `dp[len(nums)]` is updated to max(`dp[len(nums)]`, `dp[j] + 1`) for some valid `j`.**
