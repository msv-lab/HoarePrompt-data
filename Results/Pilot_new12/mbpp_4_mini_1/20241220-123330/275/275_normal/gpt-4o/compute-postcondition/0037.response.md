According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which means `j` is currently 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will need to be increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2, and `i` remains `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 2**
