According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` which determines the range of the loop. The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `i-1` (i.e., a total of `i` iterations). At the end of the last iteration, since `j` is currently the last index in that iteration, it must be `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `i`, which means `i` must be greater than `j` (which was `i-1`).

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 2 (allowing `j` to take the value of 1 or higher), and at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

- `j` becomes `i`, and we consider the current subset to be updated if the next `j` still fits the divisible condition.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list representing the sizes of the largest divisible subsets, `i` must be greater than 1, `j` is equal to i**
