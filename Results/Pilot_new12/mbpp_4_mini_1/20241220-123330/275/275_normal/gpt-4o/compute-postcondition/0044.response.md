Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` is a non-empty list, it sorts the list and computes the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element, storing those sizes in a list `dp`. The function ultimately returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which indicates the size of the largest divisible subset found. If all elements in `nums` are unique or no elements are divisible by one another, `dp` will consist solely of ones, and the function will return 1, reflecting that each element can be considered a divisible subset by itself. Thus, the function handles edge cases for empty lists and lists with non-divisible integers appropriately.**
