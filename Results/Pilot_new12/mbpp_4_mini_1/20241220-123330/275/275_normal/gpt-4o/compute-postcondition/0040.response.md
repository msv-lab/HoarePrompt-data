Output State: **`dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `nums` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` iterates through all valid indices (0 to i-1). `dp[i]` will reflect the maximum size of the divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`. If `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1 (the last index), then the values in `dp` will represent the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`.**
