To analyze the given code snippet, we begin with the following initial state: 

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n + 1` elements.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1.
- `i` is increased by 1, making it `i + 1`.

Now, we will assess the impact of the code line:

```
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Here:
- `dp[i]` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This means we are possibly finding a longer increasing subsequence ending at index `i`, which builds upon the maximum length we can achieve at index `j`, where `j < i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Since `j` is not specified in the initial condition, we can only state that `dp[j]` will depend on previously computed values of `dp` and the relationship between `nums[j]` and `nums[i]`.

Given that:
- `dp` maintains a state of lengths of increasing subsequences based on the sorted nature of `nums`, `dp[i]` will be at least equal to its current value.

After executing the code, the state of the relevant variables adjusts to reflect the potentially increased value assigned to `dp[i]`.

Therefore, summarizing the changes:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n + 1` elements; `dp` is updated at index `i` to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`; `i` is now `i + 1`.**
