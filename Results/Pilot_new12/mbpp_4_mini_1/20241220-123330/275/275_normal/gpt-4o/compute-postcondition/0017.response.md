According to the code, the loop iterates over each index `i` of the `nums` list. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `dp` is a list that reflects the size of the largest divisible subset for each corresponding element in `nums`. 

Since `i` is currently at a certain index (let's say `i` is equal to the last index of `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`), in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `len(nums)`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, there should be no specific requirement on `dp` being updated since even if it doesn't execute, it remains unchanged with its contents still having at least one element and being initialized properly.

Thus, the next state will have `i` set to the length of `nums` which does not affect the content of `dp`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list containing the size of the largest divisible subset for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums)**
