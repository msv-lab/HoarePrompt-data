The line `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The condition indicates that this occurs when `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and `j` is equal to `i-1`. Therefore, the value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`, reflecting that an additional valid subsequence can be formed if the divisibility condition holds.

Since `j` is defined as `i-1`, we do not have explicit values for `dp[i]` or `dp[j]`, but we know that the maximum function will determine the new value of `dp[i]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i-1] + 1`, where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[i-1]`.**
