According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` was previously less than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the next iteration:

- The loop will execute for `j = i - 1`.
- To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which means `i` must remain unchanged.

Thus, we need to verify that `i` still satisfies the condition for the loop to continue. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is updated such that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is greater than 1, then `dp[i]` may be increased by 1 based on the maximum value between current `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be equal to `i-1`.**
