According to the code provided, the loop execution depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1, because `range(i)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will not execute at all. 

To enable the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0. Thus, for the loop to execute, `i` should be at least 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` with all elements initialized to 1, `i` is 1**
