The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between itself and `dp[j] + 1`. The state of `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which indicates it's the size of the list and hence its value is specific. The variable `j` is equal to 1, which refers to the second element of the `dp` list under normal circumstances since it is 0-indexed. Therefore, `dp[j]` corresponds to the size of the largest divisible subset for the second element in `nums`. 

The size of the largest divisible subset for element `nums[i]` becomes `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is updated so that `dp[len(nums)]` is equal to `max(dp[len(nums)], dp[1] + 1)`, `i` is equal to len(nums), `j` is equal to 1**.
