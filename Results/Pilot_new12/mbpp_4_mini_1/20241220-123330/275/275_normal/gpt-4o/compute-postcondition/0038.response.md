The code snippet assigns the value of `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` to `dp[i]`. The variables involved are `dp[i]`, which will be updated, and `dp[j]`, which is being used in the calculation. The initial values for `i` and `j` are provided: `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 2. Therefore, `dp[i]` will take the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[2] + 1`. 

Since the specific value of `dp[i]` prior to execution is not provided, it is not explicitly stated in the output. However, `dp[j]` is also not given a specific value, so it will remain unspecified.

The Output State should include the fact that dp[i] could potentially change based on the comparison. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 2, `dp[i]` could be updated to max(dp[i], dp[2] + 1)**
