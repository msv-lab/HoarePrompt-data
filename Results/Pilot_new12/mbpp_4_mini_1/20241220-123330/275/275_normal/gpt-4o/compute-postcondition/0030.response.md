According to the code, the variable `i` is equal to `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, we can infer that `i` is at least 1 as well. The loop `for j in range(i):` will execute if `i` is greater than 0. 

At the beginning of the loop, `j` needs to start from 0. Therefore, the relevant states that need to be defined or adjusted before the loop starts are: 

1. `i` must be equal to `len(nums)` which is 1 or greater.
2. `j` is initialized to 0 in the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the states before the loop should ensure that `i` is defined correctly, `j` is initialized, and `nums` is confirmed to at least have 1 element.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` starts at 0**
