According to the code, the loop will execute for `j` in the range of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop can execute as long as `i` is at least 1; given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `len(nums)` will indeed be at least 1.

At the start of the loop, `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`. Therefore, the current state is valid for the loop to execute. Since `dp` is mentioned but not directly influencing the loop execution in this context, we maintain the rest of the necessary states.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list containing the size of the largest divisible subset for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to len(nums), and `j` will start at 0**
