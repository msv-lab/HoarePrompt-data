According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1` (inclusive) for variable `j`. If `j` begins at `0` and increments up to `i-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nums` is a sorted list with at least `n + 1` elements, which allows for multiple iterations. The current value of `j` is such that it has reached `i-1` in the previous iteration, meaning for the next iteration of the outer loop `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

Therefore, `j` will need to iterate from `0` to `i`, which means `i` should be at least `1` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n + 1` elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1, i is increased by 1 making it `i + 1`**
