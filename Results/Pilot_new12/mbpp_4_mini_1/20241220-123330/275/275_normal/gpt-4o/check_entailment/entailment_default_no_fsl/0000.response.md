Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description because it assumes that the divisibility relationship must only be checked from the current element to all previous elements while constructing the largest subset. In cases where a number can be divisible by multiple other elements, the ordering may prevent the program from finding the largest subset. 

For example, consider the input `[4, 8, 16]`. The expected output should be `3`, as all numbers are divisible by each other. However, if they are inserted in the list in a different order, such as `[16, 4, 8]`, the current implementation may fail to establish the correct relationships and return a lower subset count.

Another example can be the input `[3, 6, 9]`, which should output `3`, as `3` divides both `6` and `9`. However, if tested with `func_1([9, 3, 6])`, there might be an issue due to its reliance on a strictly iterating program that depends on sorted order and previously found pairs, potentially yielding an incorrect output.

This indicates that the solution is not comprehensive and does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an overall statement of incorrectness.
