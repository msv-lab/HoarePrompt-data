The original assessment stated that the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case described in the problem statement and concluded that the correctness is **False**. 

Upon examining the annotated version of the code and comparing it with the problem description, a few important points emerge:

1. **Functionality**: The program efficiently determines the size of the largest subset where each number is divisibly related to others by using a dynamic programming approach. The annotated code aligns closely with this logic.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The expected outputs of the provided assertions (`func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4`, `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3`, and `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4`) are achieved consistently through the algorithm.

3. **Correctness Against Problem Description**: The function is indeed designed to find the largest subset where each pair of numbers is divisible. Thus, it logically addresses the core requirements of the problem description.

4. **Regarding Edge Cases**: The original assessment brought attention to scenarios where the subset would be of size 1 (like in the case of prime numbers). However, finding such cases is not a flaw in the logic of the program but rather an illustration of the nature of the input subsets. The absence of larger divisible subsets when all numbers are prime is expected behavior, and does not contradict the function's purpose which is to find the largest divisibly-related group.

Based on the analysis of the annotated code and the reasoning surrounding the program's handling of inputs and outputs, I find that the original assessment of correctness should be revised. The function effectively calculates the size of the largest subset fulfilling the condition as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the final conclusion regarding the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
