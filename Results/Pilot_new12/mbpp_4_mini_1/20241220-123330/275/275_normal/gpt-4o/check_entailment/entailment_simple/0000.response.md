To determine whether the provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, we will analyze the program.

### Problem Description
The function is required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in that subset is divisible.

### Program Analysis
The program implements the function `func_1`, which takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns the size of the largest subset where each pair is divisible.

1. **Empty List Check**:
   - If the input list `nums` is empty, the function correctly returns `0`. This aligns with a logical assumption that an empty subset exists but has no elements.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the list, which is a necessary step to efficiently check for divisibility within the loop. This is because if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (where `j < i`), it must be the case that `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `nums[i]` after sorting.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized where each entry starts at `1`, indicating that each number alone can be a subset of size `1`.
   - The nested loop checks all previous numbers `j` for each number `i`, updating `dp[i]` to reflect the size of the largest subset that can be formed with `nums[i]`, based on previously established results in `dp`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The function finally returns the `max(dp)`, which represents the largest size of a subset of `nums` such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible.

### Test Cases
The assertions are designed to verify that the function behaves correctly for specific cases:
- For `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`, the largest subset is `1, 6, 18`, which has size `3` (the assertion is incorrect).
- For `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])`, the largest subset is `5, 10, 20`, which has size `3` (the assertion is correct).
- For `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])`, the subset `1, 18` is possible, giving a size of `2` (again the assertion is incorrect).

### Conclusion
Given that the assertions are incorrect and that the function does not return the expected values for all input cases according to the problem description, we find that the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
