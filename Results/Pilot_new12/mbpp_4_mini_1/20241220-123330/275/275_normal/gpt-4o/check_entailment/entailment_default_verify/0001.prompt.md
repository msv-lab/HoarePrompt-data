You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description.

### Problem Description
The goal is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

### Code Review
The proposed function `func_1` is implemented as follows:

1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct.
2. It sorts the numbers in ascending order.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element starts at 1 (i.e., each number can at least form a pair with itself).
4. It iterates through each number in the list and checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of the previous numbers.
5. If a number is divisible, it updates the `dp` array to reflect the maximum size of the subset that can include that number.
6. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

### Test Cases Analysis
Now, let's analyze the provided assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`
   - Expected output: 4
   - Possible subset: [1, 3, 6, 18] (All are divisible by 1)
   - The output is correct.

2. `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])`
   - Expected output: 3
   - Possible subset: [5, 10, 15] (All are divisible by 5)
   - The output is correct.

3. `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])`
   - Expected output: 4
   - Possible subset: [1, 3, 6, 18] (Again, all are divisible by 1)
   - The output is correct.

### Additional Test Case
To determine if the function works for all edge cases, consider adding one more test case:

`func_1([4, 2, 8, 16, 32])`
- Expected output: 5
- Possible subset: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] (All are divisible by 2)
- If the function returns the correct size of 5, the function would be affirmed.

### Conclusion
Looking through the implementation, it correctly handles the test cases provided in the assertions and the additional test case proposed, suggesting that the logic implemented correctly finds the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` is a non-empty list, it sorts the list and computes the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element, storing those sizes in a list `dp`. The function ultimately returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which indicates the size of the largest divisible subset found. If all elements in `nums` are unique or no elements are divisible by one another, `dp` will consist solely of ones, and the function will return 1, reflecting that each element can be considered a divisible subset by itself. Thus, the function handles edge cases for empty lists and lists with non-divisible integers appropriately.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
