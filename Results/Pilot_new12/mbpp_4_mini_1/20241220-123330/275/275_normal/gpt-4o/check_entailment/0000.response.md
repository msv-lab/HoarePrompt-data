To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's examine it against the problem description:

**Problem Description:** Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Initial Analysis
1. **Input Handling:** The function checks if the input list is empty and returns `0` if it is.
2. **Sorting:** It sorts the array, which is appropriate since divisibility is easier to check in a sorted array.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** It initializes a `dp` array where each entry signifies the size of the largest subset ending at each index.
4. **Nested Loops:** It checks pairs of numbers to see if one is divisible by another and updates the `dp` array appropriately.

### Testing the Functionality
The assertions imply certain expected outputs, which we will check against:
- For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the expected output is `4`. The reasoning might involve numbers that can form pairs with divisibility. Possible valid pairs can include, for example, `1, 3, 6`, and others. It seems achievable to get a size of 4.
- For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the expected output is `3`, which could involve combinations of 5, 10, and 20.
- For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, again the expected output is `4`, likely stemming from the involvement of `1`, `3`, `6`, and `18`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic
While evaluating the correctness:
- All the given test cases return the expected results as mentioned in the assertions, but we need to consider edge cases.
- A potential edge case that is not handled is when all numbers in the list are prime numbers or when no two numbers are divisible.
  - For instance: `func_1([3, 5, 7, 11])` would return `1`, which is the correct value but doesn't satisfy the requirement of finding a subset of size larger than 1. The function would only count individual elements as valid subsets.

### Conclusion
The presence of valid inputs where the expected behavior does not yield a size greater than the individual numbers exposes a failure in correctly identifying divisible subsets of larger size.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
