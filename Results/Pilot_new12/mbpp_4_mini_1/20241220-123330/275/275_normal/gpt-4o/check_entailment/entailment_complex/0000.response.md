Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is tasked with finding the size of the largest subset of a list of integers where every pair of integers in the subset is divisible by one another.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - When the input list (`nums`) is empty, the function returns `0`, which is appropriate and satisfies the base case of the problem statement.
   - In the case of a non-empty list, the algorithm processes the integers to determine the largest divisible subset.

3. **Sorting and Dynamic Programming Logic**: 
   - The function sorts the list of integers. This is essential because it allows for a structured way to check divisibility, ensuring that when considering integers `i` and `j`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `nums[j]` must come before `nums[i]` in the sorted order.
   - A dynamic programming approach with the list `dp` is utilized, where each position `dp[i]` tracks the size of the largest divisible subset that includes the integer `nums[i]`. The nested loops iterate through pairs, allowing updates to `dp[i]` based on previous values, ensuring that all pairs of the divisibility condition are checked.

4. **Result Computation**: 
   - At the end of the function, `max(dp)` is returned, effectively providing the size of the largest divisible subset.

5. **Performance**: The complexity of the algorithm is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list. This is suitable for moderate input sizes and ensures all conditions are checked.

In summary, the program meets all requirements outlined in the problem description by correctly identifying the size of the largest subset of integers, ensuring all pairs in that subset fulfill the divisibility condition, effectively handling edge cases, and utilizing appropriate algorithm design. Therefore, the correctness of the function can be confirmed.
