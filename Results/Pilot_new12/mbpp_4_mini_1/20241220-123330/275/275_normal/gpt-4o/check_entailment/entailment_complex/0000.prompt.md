You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and each `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains as a list of 1s.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list `nums`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of 1s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` is a non-empty list, it sorts the list and computes the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element, storing those sizes in a list `dp`. The function ultimately returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which indicates the size of the largest divisible subset found. If all elements in `nums` are unique or no elements are divisible by one another, `dp` will consist solely of ones, and the function will return 1, reflecting that each element can be considered a divisible subset by itself. Thus, the function handles edge cases for empty lists and lists with non-divisible integers appropriately.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
