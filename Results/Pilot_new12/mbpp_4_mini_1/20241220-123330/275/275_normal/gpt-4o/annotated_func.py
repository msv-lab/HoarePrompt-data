#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
    nums.sort()

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and each `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains as a list of 1s.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list `nums`. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of 1s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` is a non-empty list, it sorts the list and computes the sizes of the largest divisible subsets for each element, storing those sizes in a list `dp`. The function ultimately returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which indicates the size of the largest divisible subset found. If all elements in `nums` are unique or no elements are divisible by one another, `dp` will consist solely of ones, and the function will return 1, reflecting that each element can be considered a divisible subset by itself. Thus, the function handles edge cases for empty lists and lists with non-divisible integers appropriately.
