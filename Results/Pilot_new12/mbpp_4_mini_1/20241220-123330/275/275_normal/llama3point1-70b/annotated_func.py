#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is the default return value indicating that the list 'nums' is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `len(dp)` is equal to `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If the list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0, indicating that there are no elements to consider. If `nums` contains elements, the function sorts `nums` in ascending order and calculates the length of the longest subset in `nums` where each element is divisible by the preceding elements in the subset. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach, storing the maximum lengths of such divisible subsets in a list `dp`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset. The function effectively handles the case of an empty list and computes the desired result for non-empty lists, while the annotations generally align with the functionality provided by the actual code.
