Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` maintains its length equal to `nums`, `j` is `j_last + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.***
