Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is updated such that each entry `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` is at least 1, and `len(nums)` must be at least `i + 1`. The values in `dp` reflect the maximum lengths determined based on the divisibility of `nums[i]` by previous `nums[j]` values. If `i` is 0, then the loop did not execute, and `dp[i]` is initialized to 1.**
