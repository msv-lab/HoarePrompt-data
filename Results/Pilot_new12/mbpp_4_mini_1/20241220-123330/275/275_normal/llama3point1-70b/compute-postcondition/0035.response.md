To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the impactful variable assignments and the logic applied in the statement.

In the given code:
- `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value, `dp[i]`, and `dp[j] + 1`.
- We know that `i` is `2` and `j` is `1`, so the code modifies `dp[2]`.

The final values after executing the code do not affect `nums`, `i`, or `j`. The only affected value is `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[2]` is updated to max(`dp[2]`, `dp[1] + 1`)**
