`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since both `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are initialized to 1, we can express it as follows:
- Current value of `dp[i]` is `dp[i]` (which is 1).
- Current value of `dp[j]` is `1`.
- Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(1, 1 + 1)`, which results in `dp[i]` being updated to `2`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the overall output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` is 2, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1s except for `dp[i]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
