Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, dp is updated such that each entry `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, i is 2.

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[1]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`. If `nums[2]` is not divisible by `nums[1]`, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. This case will not occur since `j` iterates only from 0 to `i-1`.

Final Output State: If checking each `j` from 0 to 1, `dp[2]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[2]`, calculated based on the divisibility conditions applied to `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. Therefore, `dp[2]` will be updated based on the divisibility of `nums[2]` by `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

Output State: **`dp[2]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with `nums[2]`, and is influenced by the divisibility of `nums[2]` with respect to `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.**
