To simulate the execution of the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact on the `dp` list and the variables `i` and `j`.

- The line `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` will update the value of `dp[i]` based on the value of `dp[j]`. 
- We assume `dp` is a list with enough elements indexed from `0` to at least `j`, given that `i` is at least `1` and `j` is `2`.
- Since `nums` is sorted in ascending order and contains at least 2 elements, it's reasonable to assume `dp` is properly initialized and elements exist at index `i` and `j`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`, we can only describe their relationship based on the max function applied.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated state of `dp[i]`, which is now the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 2 and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
