According to the code, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `j` and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the current index from the previous loop iteration (but not explicitly given), and we know that `i` is at least 2 or more because the length of `nums` is at least 2, and `i` must also be less than the length of `nums`. 

For the loop to execute one more time with `j`, we can deduce that `j` must be incremented by 1 from its last value. If we let the last value of `j` be `j_last`, for the loop to run again, `j` should equal `j_last + 1`. In addition, `j` must still be less than `i`.

Thus, if `j_last` is the last index used in the previous iteration (which we can map as `j`), we can conclude that for the next iteration to run, `i` must be at least be greater than `j_last + 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` maintains its length equal to `nums`, j is `j_last + 1`, and `i` must be greater than `j_last + 1**.
