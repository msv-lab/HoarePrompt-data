Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subset, `i` is at least 1, `j` is initialized at 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
