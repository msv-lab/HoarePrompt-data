The code snippet initializes a list `dp` where each element is set to 1, and the length of `dp` is equal to the length of the list `nums`. The variable `dp` takes on the structure of an array filled with 1s, corresponding to the integer entries in the sorted list `nums`. The values of `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1s.**
