Initial State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1s.  
Code of the loop:  
```
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    for j in range(i):
        if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with the corresponding element in `nums`, and `dp` maintains its length equal to `nums`. 

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is updated such that each entry `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` is at least 1, and `len(nums)` must be at least `i + 1`. The values in `dp` reflect the maximum lengths determined based on the divisibility of `nums[i]` by previous `nums[j]` values. If `i` is 0, then the loop did not execute, and `dp[i]` is initialized to 1. 

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dp[2]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with `nums[2]`, and is influenced by the divisibility of `nums[2]` with respect to `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. 

Final Output State after all iterations of the loop have finished: `dp` is a list where each entry `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `nums` remains as a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` maintains its length equal to `nums`, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed.

Output State: **`dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `len(dp)` is equal to `len(nums)`.**
