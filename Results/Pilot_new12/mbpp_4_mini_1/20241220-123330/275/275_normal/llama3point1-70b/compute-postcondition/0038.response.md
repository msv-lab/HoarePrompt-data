The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are both `2`. Therefore, the expression becomes `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[2] + 1)`. If `dp[2]` is currently `x`, then the new value of `dp[2]` will be `max(x, x + 1)`, which will always result in `x + 1` since `x + 1` is greater than `x`.  

The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) are not directly affected, but the value of `dp[2]` is updated. Thus, we state this in the output. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[2]` is now equal to the old value of `dp[2] + 1`.**
