In the code snippet provided, `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

1. `dp[i]` will be updated based on values from the `dp` array. The maximum will be calculated using the current value of `dp[i]` and the value at `dp[j]` incremented by one.
2. The variable `j` is given as `j_last + 1`, and it is stated that `i` must be greater than `j_last + 1`. This means that `i` is effectively greater than `j` in this context, ensuring that `dp[j]` is valid and can be referenced.

The other variables (`nums`, `dp`, `j`, and any parameters concerning the list) are not altered. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change made to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` has been updated such that `dp[i]` is now max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`), `j` is `j_last + 1`, and `i` is greater than `j_last + 1.**
