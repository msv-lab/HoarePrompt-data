According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`. The loop will run for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, which implies that `i` must be at least `1` for the loop to have at least one iteration. Given that `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, this indicates there are multiple elements in `nums` beyond the current index `i`.

The provided state before the loop states that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, which is sufficient for our use. However, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that `i` has been initialized such that `i` must be at least `1` so that `j` can take valid increments. Also, `j` will begin at `0`, which aligns with the iteration range mentioned.

Thusï¼Œthe states need to be adjusted to emphasize that `i` must be at least `1` and `j` will initialize from `0`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subset, `i` must be at least 1, `j` is initialized at 0**
