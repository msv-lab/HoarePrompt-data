Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` maintains its length equal to `nums`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is `j_last + 1` and `i` is greater than `j_last + 1.***
