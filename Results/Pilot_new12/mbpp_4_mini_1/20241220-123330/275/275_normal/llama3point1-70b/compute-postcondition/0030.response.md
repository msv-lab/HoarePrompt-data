According to the code, the loop uses the variable `j` which is the loop iterator that will range from 0 to `i-1`. Since `i` is 2, this means `j` will iterate over the values 0 and 1. For the loop to execute, `j` needs to start at 0, and it will take values that indicate the first two indices of `nums` (0 and 1).

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
