According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts at 1 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have a length of at least 2. Additionally, `i` will start at 1 and increment in each iteration, so at the start of the loop, `i` is 1. 

Therefore, the relevant states to adjust are:

- `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.
- `i` is currently 1, which will allow the loop to run for the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1s, `i` is 1**
