According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute `i` times, which means it will run for `j` values from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is given as 1, the loop will execute exactly once. 

Before the loop starts, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, filled with 1s, and since `nums` is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, it ensures that `dp` has a valid length. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop (considering the loop runs once), `j` would be 0. So, for the loop to execute, the state should reflect that `j` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` filled with 1s, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
