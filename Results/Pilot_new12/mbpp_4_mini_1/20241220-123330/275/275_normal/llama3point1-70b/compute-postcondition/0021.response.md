Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is updated for `dp[i]` by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` whenever `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. The variables `i` is at least 1, and `j` is initialized at 0, maintaining the divisibility condition where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.***
