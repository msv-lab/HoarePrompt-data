According to the code, the loop iterates over the range determined by the value of `i`. Since `j` is initialized at 0 and should increase by 1 with each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i - 1` (as the range is `range(i)`, meaning it will run while `j` is less than `i`). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, and `j` was initialized at 0. Therefore, for one more iteration, `j` should be 1 (it will increment by 1). Also, since `nums` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, and we are checking divisibility, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`.

In summary, if `i` remains as it is, then at the start of the next iteration, we need to state that `j` has now reached 1 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
