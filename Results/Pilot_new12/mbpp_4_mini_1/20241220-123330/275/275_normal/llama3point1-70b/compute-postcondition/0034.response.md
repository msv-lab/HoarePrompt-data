According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 1. 

For the loop to execute an additional time, `i` must remain the same (which is 2) because it defines the upper limit of `j`. 

Therefore, after the next iteration, the state should reflect `j` being 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
