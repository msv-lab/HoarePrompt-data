According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index used in the loop, which starts at 1 and increments with each iteration. Since `nums` is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, its length will be equal to or greater than 2. 

If `i` is currently the last index (which would be `len(nums) - 1`), the loop will not execute one more time, as the `range` provided would only allow values less than `len(nums)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, if we denote the current value of `i` as `i`, then to execute one more time, we need to state that `i` would be increased by 1, and the condition on `nums` remains valid as it has at least 2 elements, allowing `len(nums)` to be at least 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with the corresponding element in `nums`, `i` is the next index which is `i + 1`, and `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
