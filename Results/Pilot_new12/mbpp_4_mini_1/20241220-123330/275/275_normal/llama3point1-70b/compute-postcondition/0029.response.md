According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums` compared to `i`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and `len(nums)` is at least `i + 1`, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. The loop can execute again if `len(nums)` is at least `i + 1`, which now requires that `len(nums)` must be at least 3 when `i` is incremented to 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, dp is updated such that each entry `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, i is 2**
