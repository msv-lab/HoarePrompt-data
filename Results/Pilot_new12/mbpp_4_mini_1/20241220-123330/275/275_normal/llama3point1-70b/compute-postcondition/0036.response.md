Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[2]` remains unchanged.***
