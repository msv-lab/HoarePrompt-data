According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is 1. This means the loop has been iterating with `j` starting from 0 to `i - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 2 for the next iteration. Additionally, `i` must remain the same or be greater than `j` to ensure the loop can continue executing.

Given that `nums` is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, and we are not changing `nums` in this iteration, the conditions placed on `i` are still valid.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 2.**
