According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1` (which is 1 based on `i` being 2). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented to 2, which exceeds the current value of `i`. 

Since `i` remains unchanged at 2 and `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 3 elements, the maximum value of `j` can only be 1 for this current iteration. Thus, the loop will not execute again because the range of `j` is exhausted.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
