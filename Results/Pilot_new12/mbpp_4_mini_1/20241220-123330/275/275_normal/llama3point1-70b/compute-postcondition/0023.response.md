The operation assigns the maximum value between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` to `dp[i]`. The state of `dp[j]` and `dp[i]` influences the outcome, but without specific values for `dp`, I cannot provide exact numerical outcomes or ranges for `dp[i]`. However, I can conclude as follows:

`dp[i]` is affected by the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The previous values of `dp[j]` and `dp[i]` are unknown; therefore, the output state remains generic regarding these variables. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order containing at least 2 elements, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
