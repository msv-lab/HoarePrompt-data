Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.

2. **Handling Empty List**: The program first checks if `nums` is empty using `if (not nums)`. If it is empty, it returns `0` as specified, indicating that there are no subsets to consider. This is appropriate behavior for an empty input.

3. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Sorting is a crucial step before determining subsets, as it simplifies identifying divisible pairs. 

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program initializes a list `dp` where each entry starts at `1`, indicating that every individual number is a valid subset of size `1`. 

5. **Nested Loops for Divisibility Check**: The program uses nested loops to check every pair of numbers in the sorted list. For each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, it checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This effectively counts the size of the largest subset ending with `nums[i]` where all previous numbers in the subset are divisible by `nums[j]`.

6. **Max Length Extraction**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the length of the largest divisible subset from the input list.

Overall, the program correctly captures the logic required to find the largest subset of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
