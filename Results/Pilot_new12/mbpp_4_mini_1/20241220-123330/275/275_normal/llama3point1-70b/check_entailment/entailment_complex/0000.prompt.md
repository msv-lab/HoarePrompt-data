You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is the default return value indicating that the list 'nums' is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `len(dp)` is equal to `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If the list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0, indicating that there are no elements to consider. If `nums` contains elements, the function sorts `nums` in ascending order and calculates the length of the longest subset in `nums` where each element is divisible by the preceding elements in the subset. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach, storing the maximum lengths of such divisible subsets in a list `dp`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset. The function effectively handles the case of an empty list and computes the desired result for non-empty lists, while the annotations generally align with the functionality provided by the actual code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
