You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies the size of the largest subset of a list such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by each other. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the input list of numbers, which is essential as it allows the algorithm to ensure that when checking pairs for divisibility, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `nums[i]` must be greater than or equal to `nums[j]` (given the sorted order).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program initializes a list `dp` where each element represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at that index. Every number can at least form a subset of size 1 (itself), hence the initial value of `1`.

3. **Nested Loop for Pairs**: The outer loop iterates through each number, while the inner loop checks all the previously considered numbers in the sorted list. If a number is found that is divisible (i.e., `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`), it updates `dp[i]` to reflect the maximum size of the subset by either keeping the previous maximum or including this new number.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the maximum value of `dp` is returned, which corresponds to the size of the largest subset where each pair of numbers is divisible.

After reviewing the program against a wide array of potential input cases (including edge cases), no flaws or missing logic have been identified. It appears to handle empty lists, single element lists, and general cases with larger inputs correctly. Thus, we conclude that it satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is the default return value indicating that the list 'nums' is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list where each entry represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `len(dp)` is equal to `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with corresponding elements in 'nums'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
