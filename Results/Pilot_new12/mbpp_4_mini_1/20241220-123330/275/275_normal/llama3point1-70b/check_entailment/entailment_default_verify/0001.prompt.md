You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of why the code is correct in every case:

1. **Base Case**: If the input list `nums` is empty, the function correctly returns 0, which aligns with the expectation that no subset exists.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the numbers, which ensures that all comparisons for divisibility are made in a manner that will always lead to correct evaluations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The program initializes a `dp` list of the same length as `nums` with all values set to 1. This signifies that each element can be a subset of size 1 by itself.

4. **Nested Loops for Divisibility**: The two nested loops iterate through each element in the sorted list. For each number, the inner loop checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any prior number. If it is, the size of the subset ending with this number is updated, effectively building the largest subset dynamically.

5. **Max Calculation**: Finally, the program returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which correctly represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

This approach successfully covers various input scenarios, including cases with duplicate numbers, primes, zeros, and other edge cases.

Since I could not find any potential case where the program fails to provide the correct result according to the problem description, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If the list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0, indicating that there are no elements to consider. If `nums` contains elements, the function sorts `nums` in ascending order and calculates the length of the longest subset in `nums` where each element is divisible by the preceding elements in the subset. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach, storing the maximum lengths of such divisible subsets in a list `dp`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset. The function effectively handles the case of an empty list and computes the desired result for non-empty lists, while the annotations generally align with the functionality provided by the actual code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
