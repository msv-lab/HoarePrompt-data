Final: **False**

The original assessment claims that the program is correct, but the output hints indicate possible issues that were not considered in the assessment. While the core functionality of searching for an element and returning its index is correctly implemented, the hints highlight that there are no specific validations concerning the type of the `array` or `element`. This means that if the input is not valid (e.g., `array` is not a list), the program could raise an error, which contradicts the requirement that the function should always output the desired boolean and index or an indication of failure.

Therefore, while the function may handle common cases correctly, it does not sufficiently guarantee that it always conforms to the expectations set in the problem description, particularly considering the lack of input validations. This makes the original assessment of **True** inaccurate.
