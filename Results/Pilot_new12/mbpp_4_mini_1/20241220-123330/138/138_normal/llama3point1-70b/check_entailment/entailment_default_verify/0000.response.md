Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by utilizing the list method `index` to find the position of `element` in `array`. The program returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present (True) and its index if found, or (False, -1) if not found, which aligns perfectly with the requirements.

The output hints confirm that the function handles the cases where the input `array` could be empty or consist of any type of elements, as well as the core functionality of returning the appropriate tuple based on the presence of `element` in `array`. Since the assumptions state that valid inputs will be provided, the lack of explicit type validation does not detract from the correctness for this context.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program's behavior, and the output hints, the program's implementation is correct and meets the specified requirements.
