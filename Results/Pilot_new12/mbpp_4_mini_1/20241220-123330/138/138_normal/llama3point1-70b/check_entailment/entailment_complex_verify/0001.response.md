Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly establishes that the program meets the problem description by accurately implementing the requirements. The function `func_1` effectively takes in an array and an element, checks for the presence of the element, and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating the element's presence and its index position (or -1 if not found). 

Supporting the assessment is the annotated version of the code, which confirms that the program handles both cases: when the element is found and when it's not. It properly returns `(True, index)` when the element exists and `(False, -1)` when a `ValueError` is raised. The function also gracefully manages edge cases such as empty arrays.

While the program does not explicitly validate the types of `array` or `element`, the assumption that valid input will be provided prevents this from being an issue as stated in the prompt. Based on this reasoning and the consistent behavior illustrated in both the original assessment and annotated code, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
