You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as arguments, then checks if the element is present in the array. If found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

Here are the key considerations:

1. **Element Found**: If the element is present in the array, `array.index(element)` successfully finds the index, and the function returns `(True, index)`.
2. **Element Not Found**: If the element is not present in the array, the `ValueError` exception is caught, leading to the return of `(False, -1)`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles empty arrays correctly, as `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError` if the array is empty and thus will return `(False, -1)`. 

Since the function behaves as required under normal and edge case input, it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of elements, and element can be any type.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns True along with the index which is the position of element in the array.
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns a tuple (False, -1)
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `array` is a list of elements which can be of any type. If the `element` is found, the function returns (True, index) where index is the position of element in the array; otherwise it returns (False, -1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `array` and an `element`. It attempts to find the index of `element` in `array`. If `element` is found, the function returns a tuple (True, index), where `index` is the position of `element` in `array`. If `element` is not found, a ValueError is raised and the function returns (False, -1). The function handles cases where the input `array` could be empty or contain elements of any type. There are no specific validations on the types of `array` or `element`, which means it can raise an error if `array` is not a list or if an operation is performed on unsupported types. Therefore, the final state indicates that the program outputs a boolean indicating presence and the corresponding index or a failure signal.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
