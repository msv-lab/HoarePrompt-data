Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(array, element)` correctly takes an array (a list of elements) and an element, as required by the problem statement.

2. **Finding the Element**: The program uses `array.index(element)` to find the index of `element` in `array`. If `element` is present, it correctly retrieves the index, which is a fundamental part of what is required. 

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, indicating the element's presence and its position. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to return a boolean indicating presence and the index.
   - If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is caught, and the function returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the requirement to return `False` and `-1` when the element is not found.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The annotations clarify that the function can handle cases where the input array is empty or when the element is of any type, which is consistent with typical use cases as stated in the problem description.

5. **Assumptions**: It is noted that the program does not perform type validations on the inputs, which is acceptable under the given assumption that inputs will always be valid and well-formed as per the problem description.

In summary, the program correctly implements the requirements to return a boolean indicating if an element is in the array and, if so, its index, or `False` and `-1` if it is not. There are no cases identified where the program would fail to meet the problem description, hence it is correct.
