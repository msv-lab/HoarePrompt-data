Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as arguments, then checks if the element is present in the array. If found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

Here are the key considerations:

1. **Element Found**: If the element is present in the array, `array.index(element)` successfully finds the index, and the function returns `(True, index)`.
2. **Element Not Found**: If the element is not present in the array, the `ValueError` exception is caught, leading to the return of `(False, -1)`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles empty arrays correctly, as `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError` if the array is empty and thus will return `(False, -1)`. 

Since the function behaves as required under normal and edge case input, it is correct.
