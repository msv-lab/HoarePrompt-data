The provided Python program accurately implements the required functionality as per the problem description. The `func_1` function checks whether an element exists in an array and returns a tuple indicating the presence of the element along with its index position if found. 

The code properly uses the `index` method of the list, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present, allowing for a clean handling of this scenario through a try-except block. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to return `(False, -1)` if the element is not found. 

The output hints confirm that the implementation meets the problem description, as they describe the process correctly and point out that the function can handle various element types within the list.

Since there are no edge cases mentioned that could lead to incorrect behavior, and the assumptions made regarding the validity of input are adhered to, the solution performs as expected in all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
