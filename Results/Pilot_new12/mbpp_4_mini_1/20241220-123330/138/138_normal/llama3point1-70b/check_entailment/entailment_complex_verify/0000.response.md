Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly states that the program's functionality aligns with the problem description. The program effectively uses the `index` method to determine if the `element` exists in the `array` and returns the appropriate tuple based on the outcome. The annotation supports this by outlining the behavior of the program under various conditions, confirming that it handles the presence and absence of the element correctly. Therefore, the program meets the specifications of the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
