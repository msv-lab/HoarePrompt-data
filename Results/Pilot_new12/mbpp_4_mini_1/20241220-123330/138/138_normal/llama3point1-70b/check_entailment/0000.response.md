Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It checks whether the given element is in the array using the built-in `index` method of lists. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught, and the function returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. The function handles all relevant cases, including an empty array and an element not present in the array, thereby satisfying the requirements of the problem description.
