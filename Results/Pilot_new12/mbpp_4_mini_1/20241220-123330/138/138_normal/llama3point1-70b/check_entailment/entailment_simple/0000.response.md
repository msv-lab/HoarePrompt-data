Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it always does what the problem description specifies:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (which can be of any type).
2. It uses a `try-except` block to attempt to find the index of the given `element` in the `array` using the `index()` method.
3. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the `element` in the `array`. This satisfies the requirement to return a boolean indicating the presence of the `element` in the `array` along with its index.
4. If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns `(False, -1)`, consistent with the requirement that it should return `-1` when the `element` is not found.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem statement, ensuring that it returns the correct boolean and index in all scenarios defined by the requirements.
