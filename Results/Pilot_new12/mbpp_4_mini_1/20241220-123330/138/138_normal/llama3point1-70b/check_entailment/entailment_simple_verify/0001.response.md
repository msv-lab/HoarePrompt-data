Based on the problem description, the program's implementation, and the provided annotated version, it appears that the program correctly addresses the requirements of the problem. 

1. The function `func_1` takes an input array and an element, which aligns with the problem description.
2. The use of `array.index(element)` correctly searches for the element in the list. If the element is found, it returns `True` and the relevant index, satisfying the requirement to return a tuple indicating presence and position.
3. If the element is not found, the expected `ValueError` is properly handled by the `except` clause, which returns the correct tuple `(False, -1)`.
4. The annotated state of the program clarifies that it can handle various types of elements in the list and that both the successful and unsuccessful search cases are properly covered.

The original assessment has concluded that the correctness of the program is **True** due to its correct handling of both found and not found cases, and the annotations support this conclusion by expounding on the states and outcomes of the function.

Thus, I maintain the original assessment as accurate.

Final: **True**
