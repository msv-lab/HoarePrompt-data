Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input `array` is not a list or when `array` is empty. While the problem description assumes valid input, it is important to note that the implementation should gracefully handle these cases, according to common standards of robustness. If the program receives a non-list input or an empty list as input, it doesn't raise any specific error message or return a proper response but fails to address these cases altogether. Moreover, since the output hints indicate that the function must operate with general types, having no type validation or error handling leads to uncertainty regarding the function's reliability in scenarios that hypothetically may not adhere to expected input formats. Additionally, it should return a clear output indicating invalid situations instead of just relying on a ValueError to handle them.
