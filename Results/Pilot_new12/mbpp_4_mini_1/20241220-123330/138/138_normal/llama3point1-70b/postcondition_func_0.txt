The function accepts a list `array` and an `element`. It attempts to find the index of `element` in `array`. If `element` is found, the function returns a tuple (True, index), where `index` is the position of `element` in `array`. If `element` is not found, a ValueError is raised and the function returns (False, -1). The function handles cases where the input `array` could be empty or contain elements of any type. There are no specific validations on the types of `array` or `element`, which means it can raise an error if `array` is not a list or if an operation is performed on unsupported types. Therefore, the final state indicates that the program outputs a boolean indicating presence and the corresponding index or a failure signal.
