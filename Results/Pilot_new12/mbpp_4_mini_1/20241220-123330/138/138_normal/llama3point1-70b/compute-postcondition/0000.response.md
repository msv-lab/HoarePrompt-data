The value of `index` is assigned the result of `array.index(element)`, which retrieves the position of the specified `element` within the `array`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of elements; `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements; `index` is the position of `element` in `array`.**
