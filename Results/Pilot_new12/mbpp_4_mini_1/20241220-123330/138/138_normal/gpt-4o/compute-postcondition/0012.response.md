The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type. After executing the function body, the function performs the following:

- If `element` is found at index 0 of `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index 0.
- If `element` is found at index 1 of `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index 1.
- If `element` is found at index 2 of `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index 2.
- If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` indicating that `element` is not found, along with -1 indicating that there is no valid index for `element`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return whether the element is found in the list along with its index or an indication that the element is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns `True` and the index of the element if found in positions 0, 1, or 2; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1 if the element is not found.**
