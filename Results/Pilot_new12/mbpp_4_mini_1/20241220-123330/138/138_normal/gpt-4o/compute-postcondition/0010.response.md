Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements; if `element` is found in `arr`, the loop will return True along with the corresponding `index`, which is the position of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found after all iterations, the loop will not return anything, and `index` will be equal to the length of `arr` (indicating the number of elements traversed).**
