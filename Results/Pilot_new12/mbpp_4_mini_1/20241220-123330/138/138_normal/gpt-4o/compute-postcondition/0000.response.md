According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. The loop will successfully execute if `arr` has at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, the `index` will be 0, and `value` will be the first element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list must contain at least 1 element, and the initial states should reflect that `index` is 0 and `value` is the first element of the `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the list**
