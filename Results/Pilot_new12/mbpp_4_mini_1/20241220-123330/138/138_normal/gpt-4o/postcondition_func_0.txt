The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It checks if `element` is present in the list `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `element` is not found in `arr` after checking all elements, it returns `False` and -1 to indicate that `element` is not present. The function handles all elements in the list, regardless of their type, and correctly accounts for cases where the list is empty or where the `element` is not present at all. There are no restrictions on the index range, with the function correctly identifying the absence of the element by returning -1.
