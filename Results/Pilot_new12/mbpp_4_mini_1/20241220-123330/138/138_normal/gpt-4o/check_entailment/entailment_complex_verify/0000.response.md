Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element, checks for the presence of the element in the array, and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is found along with its index. 

The annotations provide clear insight into the program's behavior:
1. The function handles the input correctly, verifying each value in the provided list against the element.
2. If the element is found, it returns `True` and the corresponding index; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1.
3. The program does not have any restrictions on the type of elements in the array or the element being searched, making it robust in that regard.

Moreover, the provided assertions effectively cover various scenarios corresponding to the expected output. Since all of these points align with the initial assessment and the expectations laid out in the problem description, we conclude that the program is implemented correctly.
