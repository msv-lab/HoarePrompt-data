Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` in the provided program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly checks if a specified element is present in the input array, returning a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating the presence of the element and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function operates as follows:
1. It enumerates through the array, giving both the index and the value of each element.
2. If it finds a value that matches the specified element, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the found element.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)` indicating that the element was not found.

The provided assertions confirm the following scenarios worked correctly:
- `(True, 3)` for element `31` in the array, meaning the value is present and at index `3`.
- `(True, 7)` for element `61` in the array, present at index `7`.
- `(True, 6)` for element `48` in the array, present at index `6`.

No edge cases or inputs were found where the function would not perform as required:
- An empty list input `func_1([], 1)` would return `(False, -1)`, which is the correct behavior as there are no elements to find.
- Searching for a non-existent element, like `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`, correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

Thus, after reviewing all aspects of the program, it correctly adheres to the problem description for every potential case.
