You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` in the provided program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly checks if a specified element is present in the input array, returning a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating the presence of the element and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function operates as follows:
1. It enumerates through the array, giving both the index and the value of each element.
2. If it finds a value that matches the specified element, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the found element.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)` indicating that the element was not found.

The provided assertions confirm the following scenarios worked correctly:
- `(True, 3)` for element `31` in the array, meaning the value is present and at index `3`.
- `(True, 7)` for element `61` in the array, present at index `7`.
- `(True, 6)` for element `48` in the array, present at index `6`.

No edge cases or inputs were found where the function would not perform as required:
- An empty list input `func_1([], 1)` would return `(False, -1)`, which is the correct behavior as there are no elements to find.
- Searching for a non-existent element, like `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`, correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

Thus, after reviewing all aspects of the program, it correctly adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements; if `element` is found in `arr`, the loop will return True along with the corresponding `index`, which is the position of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found after all iterations, the loop will not return anything, and `index` will be equal to the length of `arr` (indicating the number of elements traversed).
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False indicating that `element` is not found in `arr`, and -1 indicating that there is no valid index for `element`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
