Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description: it checks if a given element exists in an array and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating presence and the index position of the element.

The annotations support this conclusion effectively. They clarify that before the function call, the input `arr` is a valid list and `element` can be of any type. The code uses a loop to enumerate through the list, comparing each element with `element`. If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if the loop completes without finding a match, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The provided assertions validate the function's correctness by testing cases where the element is present and a case where it is absent, demonstrating expected behavior. According to the annotations, the states before and after the for loop correctly describe the function's behavior and expected outcomes.

Thus, the program meets the problem description requirements and the reasoning in the original assessment is supported by the annotations.
