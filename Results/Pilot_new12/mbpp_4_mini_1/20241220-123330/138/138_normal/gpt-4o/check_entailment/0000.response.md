Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs, then checks if the element exists in the array. If found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element; if not found, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. 

The provided assertions cover various cases and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. The use of `enumerate` allows for proper tracking of indices, and the function correctly handles cases where the element is present or absent. There do not appear to be any edge cases or examples where the function would fail to meet the problem requirements.
