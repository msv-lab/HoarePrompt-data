Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs, checks for the presence of the element in the array, and returns the expected tuple with the correct boolean and index position, or -1 if the element is not found. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles both cases (element present and absent) correctly and does so with valid input as expected. The function also employs `enumerate`, enabling it to track indices effectively. No edge cases appear to disrupt the expected behavior as outlined in the problem description. Thus, the final assessment maintains that the program is correct.
