The program takes an array and an element as input and iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element; if not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. Based on the problem description, the function is supposed to work correctly for every potential case, including checking all elements in the array and handling the case when the element is not present or when the array is empty.

Output hints indicate that the function checks all elements and behaves as intended if the element is present or not. The function should also handle scenarios involving varying types within the array (e.g., integers, strings), which the hints suggest is implemented correctly.

One potential edge case is that if an empty array is passed, the function should still return `(False, -1)`. Since the function iterates over the array, in the event of an empty array, it will not execute and will correctly return `(False, -1)`.

Given all of this, there isn't any scenario provided in the hints or the potential cases in which this function fails to meet the requirements described. 

Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
