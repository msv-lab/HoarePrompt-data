Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes an array (`arr`) and an element to search for, returning a tuple containing:

1. A boolean indicating whether the element is found in the array (`True` or `False`).
2. The index of the first occurrence of the element if found, or -1 if the element is not present.

I have verified the program against the output hints provided, and it correctly handles the following cases:

- The function returns `(True, index)` when the element is present, as shown in the assertions given in the program.
- The function returns `(False, -1)` when the element is not found in the array.
- It accounts for all elements, regardless of their type, as indicated in the hints.
- The program also correctly handles an empty list by returning `(False, -1)` since there are no elements to search.

Since no edge cases or examples were identified that the program does not handle according to the specifications provided, the implementation is correct in all scenarios encountered. Thus, the final determination of correctness is **True**.
