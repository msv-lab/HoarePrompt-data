The original assessment stated that the correctness of the program is **True**, and I agree with this assessment. 

The program correctly implements the desired functionality as outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks for the presence of an element in an array and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating if the element is found, alongside the index of that element or -1 if it is not found.

Evaluating the provided annotations:

1. The state before executing the function confirms that `arr` is a list and `element` can be of any type, which aligns with the assumptions in the problem description.
2. Within the function, the enumeration effectively traverses each element in the list with both its index and value. When a matching value is found, the function immediately returns `(True, index)`, which is the expected behavior.
3. The annotation after the for loop explains that if the loop completes without finding the element, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`, reflecting the fact that the element does not exist in the provided array.

The program correctly handles edge cases by returning `(False, -1)` for an empty array or for an element not in the array, as demonstrated in the assessment.

Based on all this evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I find that the program behaves as intended according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
