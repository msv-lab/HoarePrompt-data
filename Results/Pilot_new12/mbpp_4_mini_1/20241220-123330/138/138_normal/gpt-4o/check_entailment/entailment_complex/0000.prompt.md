You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements; if `element` is found in `arr`, the loop will return True along with the corresponding `index`, which is the position of `element` in `arr`. If `element` is not found after all iterations, the loop will not return anything, and `index` will be equal to the length of `arr` (indicating the number of elements traversed).
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False indicating that `element` is not found in `arr`, and -1 indicating that there is no valid index for `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It checks if `element` is present in the list `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `element` is not found in `arr` after checking all elements, it returns `False` and -1 to indicate that `element` is not present. The function handles all elements in the list, regardless of their type, and correctly accounts for cases where the list is empty or where the `element` is not present at all. There are no restrictions on the index range, with the function correctly identifying the absence of the element by returning -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
