Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The analysis confirms that the function correctly checks if a specified element exists in the provided array and returns a tuple that indicates the presence of the element along with its index. 

The output hints support the correctness by confirming that the function accurately handles various scenarios, including those with an empty list or when the element is absent. The function is designed to return `(False, -1)` in these cases, consistent with the expected output described in the problem. Furthermore, the assertions provided validate the function's correctness for elements that are present in the list.

Thus, all evidence aligns with the original assessment, reinforcing the conclusion that the program behaves as intended according to the problem description.
