To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both.

### Problem Description
The task requires writing a function that:
1. Takes in an array and an element.
2. Returns a tuple containing:
   - A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
   - The index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

### Annotated Program
The provided function `func_1` works through the following steps:
1. It iterates through the array `arr` using the `enumerate` function, which gives both the index and the value of each element in the array.
2. For each element, it checks if the value equals the `element` provided.
3. If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
4. If no match is found after the loop, it returns `(False, -1)`.

### Evaluation of the Function
- The first return statement inside the loop correctly returns `(True, index)` when the element is found, which satisfies the condition of the problem description.
- The return statement after the loop correctly handles the case where the element is not found, returning `(False, -1)`, which also matches the problem requirements.

### Edge Cases
1. If the element exists in the array, it returns the correct boolean and index.
2. If the element does not exist, it returns `False` and `-1`.
3. The function handles the case when the array is empty, returning `(False, -1)`, since it will not enter the loop.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- The function `func_1` adheres to the requirements and logic set forth in the problem description.
- It correctly identifies whether the element is in the array and returns the appropriate index or `-1` if not found.

Hence, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
