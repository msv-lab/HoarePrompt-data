You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` in the provided program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly checks if a specified element is present in the input array, returning a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating the presence of the element and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function operates as follows:
1. It enumerates through the array, giving both the index and the value of each element.
2. If it finds a value that matches the specified element, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the found element.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)` indicating that the element was not found.

The provided assertions confirm the following scenarios worked correctly:
- `(True, 3)` for element `31` in the array, meaning the value is present and at index `3`.
- `(True, 7)` for element `61` in the array, present at index `7`.
- `(True, 6)` for element `48` in the array, present at index `6`.

No edge cases or inputs were found where the function would not perform as required:
- An empty list input `func_1([], 1)` would return `(False, -1)`, which is the correct behavior as there are no elements to find.
- Searching for a non-existent element, like `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`, correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

Thus, after reviewing all aspects of the program, it correctly adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It checks if `element` is present in the list `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `element` is not found in `arr` after checking all elements, it returns `False` and -1 to indicate that `element` is not present. The function handles all elements in the list, regardless of their type, and correctly accounts for cases where the list is empty or where the `element` is not present at all. There are no restrictions on the index range, with the function correctly identifying the absence of the element by returning -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
