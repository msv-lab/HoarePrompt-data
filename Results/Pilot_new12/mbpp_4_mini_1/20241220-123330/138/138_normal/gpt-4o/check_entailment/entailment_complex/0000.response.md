The annotated program is designed to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the function `func_1` according to the description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The function must take an array (list) and an element as inputs.
2. It returns a tuple:
   - A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
   - The index position of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

### Function Analysis:
```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    return False, -1
```

1. **Looping through the array**: The program uses `enumerate` to iterate through the array `arr`, which allows it to keep track of both the index and the value of each element in the array.
2. **Checking for equality**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current `value` is equal to `element`. If it finds a match, it correctly returns a tuple with `(True, index)`, fulfilling the requirement of returning a boolean (True) and the index of the found element.
3. **Handling element not found**: If the loop finishes without finding the element, it proceeds to the line `return False, -1`. This matches the requirement for returning `False` and `-1` when the `element` is not in the `arr`.
4. **No Edge Cases Ignored**: The program accounts for all cases such as:
   - When the element is the first in the list.
   - When the element is the last in the list.
   - When the element is not present at all.
   - The program implicitly handles the case of an empty list by not entering the loop and returning `False, -1` immediately.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic as defined by the problem description and accounts for all expected cases. It successfully differentiates between when the element is present and when it is not, while adhering to the format of the return value.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
