The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function, the program returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of the cubes of all even integers in the range from 2 to `n * 2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to n*2.**
