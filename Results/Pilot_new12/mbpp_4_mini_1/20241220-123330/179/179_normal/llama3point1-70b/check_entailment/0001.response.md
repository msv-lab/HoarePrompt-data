To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to determine if it accurately computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

The first `n` even natural numbers are:
- For n = 1: 2
- For n = 2: 2, 4
- For n = 3: 2, 4, 6
- For n = 4: 2, 4, 6, 8
- And so forth...

The cubes of these numbers are:
- For n = 1: \(2^3 = 8\)
- For n = 2: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\)
- For n = 3: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\)
- For n = 4: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\)

Now let's see how the provided program handles this:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

- The program uses a generator expression to iterate over a range starting from `2` to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of `2`. This will produce the first `n` even natural numbers.
- The sum of the cubes of these numbers is then calculated and returned.

### Potential Issues
1. If `n` is 0, the code will not calculate any cubes because the range will be `range(2, 1, 2)`, resulting in an empty generator. The sum of an empty generator is `0`, which does not align with the expected behavior since the sum of the cubes of the first `0` even natural numbers could arguably be defined as `0` or could require special handling.

2. The function handles positive integers correctly but does not account for negative integers or non-integer inputs. If a negative integer is passed, it will produce an empty range and return `0`, which again may not be expected behavior.

3. There is no input validation to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. Any negative number or a non-integer will lead to incorrect results or errors.

### Conclusion
Due to these issues, primarily the handling of edge cases (like `n = 0`, negative integers, and non-integer values), the correctness of the given program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**
