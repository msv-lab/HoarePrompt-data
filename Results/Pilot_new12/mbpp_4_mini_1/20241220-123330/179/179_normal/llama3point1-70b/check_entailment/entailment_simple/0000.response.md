To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to carefully analyze both.

**Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

**Annotated Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over a range of even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`.
3. The range is specified as `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`. The starting point is 2, and it increments by 2, which correctly generates the even natural numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`).
4. It computes the cube of each of these even numbers (`i ** 3`) and sums them together using the `sum()` function.

**Correctness Evaluation**:
- When `n = 1`, the first even natural number is `2`, and `2 ** 3 = 8`, which is correct.
- When `n = 2`, the even numbers are `2` and `4`; cubes are `2 ** 3 = 8` and `4 ** 3 = 64`, giving a sum of `8 + 64 = 72`, which is also correct.
- For any non-negative integer `n`, the function correctly computes the cube of all even numbers up to `2n` and sums them.

Since the implementation correctly produces the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers as stated in the problem description and handles the expected valid input without errors, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
