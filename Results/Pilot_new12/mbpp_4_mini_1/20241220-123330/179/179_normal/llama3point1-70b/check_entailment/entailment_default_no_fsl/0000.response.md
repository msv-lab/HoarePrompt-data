Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. If `n` is 0, the function correctly returns 0 since there are no even numbers to sum.
2. For any positive integer `n`, the code generates even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` using a range with a step of 2. 
3. It computes the cubes of these even numbers and produces the correct sum.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the requirements for all valid inputs as specified, and thus it is correct for every potential case as outlined in the problem description.
