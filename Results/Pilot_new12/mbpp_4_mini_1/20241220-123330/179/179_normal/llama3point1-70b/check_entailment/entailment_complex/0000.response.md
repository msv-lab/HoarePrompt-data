Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for the function to calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. However, the program incorrectly sums the cubes of all even numbers from 2 up to `n * 2`. 

To illustrate, if `n = 3`, the function would compute the sum of the cubes of the even numbers `[2, 4, 6]`, which is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3`. However, the problem description is asking for the sum of the cubes of exactly the first `n` even natural numbers, which are:
1. For `n=1`: `[2]`
2. For `n=2`: `[2, 4]`
3. For `n=3`: `[2, 4, 6]`

This difference is crucial, as the program's implementation would produce a correct result for integers `n`, but it does not explicitly restrict to the first `n` even natural numbers starting from 2.

Thus, the function's output does not match the expectation that it should only account for the first `n` even natural numbers, leading to an incorrect result.
