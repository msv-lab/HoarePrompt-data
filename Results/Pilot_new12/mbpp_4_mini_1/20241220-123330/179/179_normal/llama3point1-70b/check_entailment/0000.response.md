Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` aims to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. However, there is a flaw in the implementation concerning the behavior for the input `n = 0`.

When `n = 0`, the function should return `0` because there are no even natural numbers to consider. However, the current implementation uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which resolves to `range(2, 1, 2)` when `n = 0`. This range generates no values, resulting in the sum of an empty list, which is `0`. Thus, the function technically provides the correct result for `n = 0`, but the problem description implies that it should provide the cube sum of "the first n even natural numbers," which suggests at least acknowledging that there are no such numbers when `n = 0`.

The function correctly computes the cube sum for positive values of `n`, but it lacks clarity for `n = 0`, where the expected output should be specified. Thus, it does not unambiguously meet the problem description for all cases. 

Moreover, the function has no checks for negative values, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Thus, the overall conclusion is that the program does not conform strictly to the problem descriptions for all potential inputs.
