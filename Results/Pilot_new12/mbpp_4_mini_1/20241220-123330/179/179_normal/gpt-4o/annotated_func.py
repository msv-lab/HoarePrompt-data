#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to 8 times the sum of the even numbers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and generates a list of the first `n` even numbers (from 2 to 2*n). It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers. The function returns this sum, which is not 8 times anything as stated in the annotations. The final state of the program is that it returns `cube_sum`, which is the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive. There are no edge cases handled for the minimum input (n = 0), which would yield a return value of 0 due to the empty list comprehension and sum.
