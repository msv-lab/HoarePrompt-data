The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the sum of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive, and returns the value of cube_sum, which is equal to 8 times this sum. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 8 times the sum of the even numbers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive.
