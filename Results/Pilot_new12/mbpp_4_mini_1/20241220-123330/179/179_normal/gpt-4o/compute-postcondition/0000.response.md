The list comprehension generates a list of even numbers by multiplying each integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` by 2. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `even_numbers` will hold the values `[2, 4, ..., 2*n]`. The exact content of `even_numbers` depends on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive.**
