To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to create a function that calculates the **cube sum of the first n even natural numbers**. The first n even natural numbers are given by the sequence: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Function Signature**: `def func_1(n)` suggests that the function takes a single non-negative integer parameter `n`.
2. **Generating Even Numbers**: The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n = 3`, this will generate `[2, 4, 6]`.
3. **Calculating Cube Sum**: The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers:
   - For `n = 2`, even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and the cubes are `[8, 64]`, summing to `72`.
   - For `n = 3`, even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`, summing to `288`.
   - For `n = 4`, even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`, summing to `800`.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the computed `cube_sum`, which is expected.

### Comparison with Problem Requirements:
The program performs the calculation of the cube sum as described in the problem statement:
- It correctly identifies the first n even natural numbers.
- It calculates the cubes of these numbers and sums them up.

### Conclusion:
The implementation matches the requirements provided in the problem description. The assertions following the function call confirm that the expected outputs are accurate.

Therefore, after verifying all elements of the program against the specified problem description:

Correctness: **True**
