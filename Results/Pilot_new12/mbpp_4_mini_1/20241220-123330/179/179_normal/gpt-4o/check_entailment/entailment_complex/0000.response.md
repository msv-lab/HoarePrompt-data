Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Mismatch in Expected Output**: The expected output from the assertions (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 72`) does not match the actual calculation performed by calling the function. For `n = 2`, the even numbers generated are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes are `8` and `64`, respectively. The sum of these cubes is `72`, which matches the assertion, but let's analyze the results for higher values of `n`.

2. **Misleading Annotation**: The comment states that the return value is "8 times the sum of the even numbers from 2 to 2*n". However, the program computes the sum of cubes of the even numbers, not "8 times" anything related to the even numbers. This inconsistency can lead to confusion around what the function is actually computing.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: Although the problem states to assume valid input, the absence of handling for `n=0` is still relevant, as the output for `n=0` should be `0`, but this case is not explicitly called out in the comments.

In conclusion, the function technically computes the correct sum of cubes for the first `n` even natural numbers; however, it is still incorrect as it does not align with the descriptions provided in both the problem statement and the annotations. The statement about returning "8 times" something is inaccurate and misleading. Therefore, overall, the program does not follow the problem description correctly.
