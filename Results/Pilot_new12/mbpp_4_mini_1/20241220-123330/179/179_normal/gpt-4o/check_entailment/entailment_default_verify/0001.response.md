Based on the problem description and the provided program, `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

### Breakdown of Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The program contains a function that:
   - Generates a list of first `n` even natural numbers.
   - Computes their cubes and sums them up.
   
   This is demonstrated in the calculations:
   - For `n=2`: Even numbers are `[2, 4]`, with \(2^3 + 4^3 = 72\).
   - For `n=3`: Even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, with \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 288\).
   - For `n=4`: Even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, with \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 800\).

2. **Edge Cases**: The function handles `n=0` correctly by returning `0` since the list would be empty. The original assessment highlighted this as a point of correctness.

3. **Input Constraints**: The current design does not specifically handle negative integers or non-integer values. However, the assessment rightly assumes that the input will be a valid non-negative integer. Given the assumption about input validity, the concerns about negative inputs do not ultimately affect the correctness of the program's functionality as specified in the problem description.

4. **Output Hints**: The hints reaffirm the function's operation and correctness by explaining what the function does with the input and confirming the expected behavior for valid input.

Given the reasoning and the alignment of the program's outputs with the expected results from the problem description, I conclude that the initial assessment of correctness is indeed accurate. 

### Final Assessment:
Final: **True**
