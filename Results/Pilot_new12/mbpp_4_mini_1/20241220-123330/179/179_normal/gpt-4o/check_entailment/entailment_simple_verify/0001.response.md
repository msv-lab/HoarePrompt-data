Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle cases of negative or non-integer inputs, which is a valid concern in a comprehensive evaluation of correctness. However, given the presumption that inputs will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the execution of the function works accurately for non-negative integers, calculating the cube sums correctly as per the problem description. 

In light of this, while the function can technically be functionally correct for the expected input (valid non-negative integers), the absence of explicit handling for all possible inputs leads me to maintain the conclusion that the function could be deemed incorrect in broader interpretative contexts. 

The annotations also confirm that the function performs correctly with the current assumptions of valid input, returning `cube_sum`, which is correctly calculated based on the problem description for all tested cases. However, the scope of correctness fundamentally includes all aspects of input validation, leading to the final conclusion that the program is indeed incorrect due to the lack of input validations for negative integers and non-numeric types.
