Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. Here's why the program works correctly in all cases:

1. The even numbers are generated with the expression `2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)`, which ensures that we obtain the first n even natural numbers: `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.
2. The cubes of these even numbers are calculated correctly using `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`, and their sum is computed using `sum(...)`.
3. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function `func_1` gives correct outputs for the inputs `2`, `3`, and `4`, which are part of the expected behavior based on the problem description.

No edge cases have been overlooked, as the program effectively handles any positive integer `n`, and the logic for calculating the cube sum has been implemented correctly.
