To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the problem description and see if the function `func_1` meets those requirements for all potential cases.

**Problem Description**: The program should find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Analysis of the Program**:
1. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` which generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. For example:
   - For `n=1`, the list will be `[2]`.
   - For `n=2`, the list will be `[2, 4]`.
   - For `n=3`, the list will be `[2, 4, 6]`.
   - For `n=4`, the list will be `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
3. It calculates the cube sum of these even numbers using `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.

**Expected Results**:
- For `func_1(2)`: 
  - Even numbers are `[2, 4]`. 
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `func_1(3)`:
  - Even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`.
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `func_1(4)`:
  - Even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
  - Cube sum: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

**Additional Cases**:
To ensure the function works for all potential cases, we should also consider edge cases such as:
- `n=0`: The function should handle this case gracefully (i.e., the cube sum of "zero" even numbers should logically be `0`).
- `n=1`: This is already covered.
- Negative values or non-integer values: Although these may fall outside typical input expectations, defining behavior for those could be relevant.

For `n=0`:
- Expected output: Cube sum should be `0`.
- Actual output: The code will compute `even_numbers` as an empty list and then return `0` for the cube sum, which is correct.

For any negative input or non-integer input, the current implementation will lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

**Conclusion**: 
The function correctly computes the cube sum for valid non-negative integers but does not explicitly handle non-integer or negative input values.

Thus, the program is **incorrect** because it does not handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs. 

Correctness: **False**
