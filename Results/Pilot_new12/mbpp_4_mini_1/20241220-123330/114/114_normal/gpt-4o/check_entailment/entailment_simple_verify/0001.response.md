Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The assertions provided confirm its correctness by demonstrating that it returns the expected results for various inputs, including cases where the element is not present in the tuple, as well as cases where it is present multiple times. The annotations further confirm that the function is designed to handle various data types for `element`, in line with the problem description. Thus, the implementation is validated as correct according to both the logic of the code and the problem requirements.
