You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of 'element' in the tuple 'tup', where 'element' can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `element`, which can be of any data type. It returns the count of occurrences of `element` within `tup`. The function effectively handles any tuple input, regardless of the data types contained within it, and correctly counts how many times `element` appears, including cases where `element` does not exist in `tup`, in which case it will return zero. There are no additional validations for the input types, meaning if `tup` is not a tuple or if `element` is of a type that cannot be evaluated in `tup`, the function will not raise an error, but it may return an unexpected count based on how Python handles these cases. Thus, the final output is the integer count of the specified `element` within the tuple `tup`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
