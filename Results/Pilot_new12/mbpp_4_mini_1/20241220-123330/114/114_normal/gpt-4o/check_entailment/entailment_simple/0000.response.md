Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and it uses the `count` method to determine the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple. This directly meets the problem's requirement to count how many times the specified element appears in the provided tuple.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The function accepts two parameters - a tuple and an element. This aligns with the problem description which specifies that the input should be a tuple and an element.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The method used, `tup.count(element)`, is a built-in tuple method that correctly counts the occurrences of `element` in `tup`. This directly responds to the core requirement of the task.
3. **Test Cases**: The provided assert statements test the function against various cases including:
   - An element not present in the tuple (expected count is 0).
   - An element present multiple times (expected counts are verified).
   - Different types of elements can be tested as the function can handle any data type due to the nature of tuples in Python.

Since the implementation meets all specified requirements and directly corresponds to the expected behavior as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
