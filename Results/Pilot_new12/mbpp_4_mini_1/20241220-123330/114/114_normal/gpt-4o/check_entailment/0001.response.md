Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The method `tup.count(element)` efficiently counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`, and the assertion tests demonstrate that the function does indeed count occurrences correctly for the provided test cases.

To further verify correctness:
- The code accurately returns `0` when the element (4) is not present in the tuple.
- It returns `3` for the element (10), which appears three times.
- It also returns `4` for the element (8), consistent with there being four occurrences.

Since the functionality is verified by edge cases in the provided assertions and there are no other reasonable edge cases where the count mechanism would fail (as tuples can contain a variety of types including repeated elements), the implementation is complete and correct. 

Overall, it meets the problem description accurately.
