Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element in a given tuple. The method `tuple.count(element)` retrieves the count directly from the tuple, ensuring that it returns the expected number of occurrences.

Here are the key points confirming the correctness:
1. The function works for tuples of any length, including empty tuples.
2. The function accurately counts elements regardless of their position in the tuple.
3. The provided assertions test the function with various elements that include both present and absent cases, showing that it can accurately determine the number of occurrences. 

As such, there are no edge cases that would cause the function to behave incorrectly based on the problem description.
