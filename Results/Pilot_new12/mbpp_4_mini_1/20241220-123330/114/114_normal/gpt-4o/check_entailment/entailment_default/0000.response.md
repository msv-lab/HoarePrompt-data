The program correctly implements the counting of occurrences of a specified element within a tuple by using the built-in method `count()`. The function `func_1` accurately returns the number of times the `element` appears within the `tup`. 

The output hints confirm that the function counts occurrences correctly for various scenarios, including when the element does not exist in the tuple (returns 0) and when it does (returns the correct count). 

Given that there are no checks for invalid input types (like non-tuple inputs), the assumption is made that the input will be valid as per your instructions. Even without additional validations, as long as the input follows the expected format of a tuple and a valid element, the function will operate correctly.

All provided assertions confirm the functionality, and there are no evident edge cases in the provided problem description that are not handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
