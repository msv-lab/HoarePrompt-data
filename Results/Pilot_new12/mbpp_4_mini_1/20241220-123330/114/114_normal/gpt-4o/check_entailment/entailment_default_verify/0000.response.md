The program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement by using the tuple method `count()` to count occurrences of a specified element. The original assessment stated that the correctness is **True**, justified by:

1. The program works with any tuple of valid length, including empty tuples.
2. The function accurately counts the specified element regardless of its position in the tuple.
3. The provided assertions adequately test the function with various cases, including elements present in the tuple and those not present, returning expected results.

The output hints reinforce this assessment by confirming that `func_1` indeed counts occurrences of `element` within `tup`, correctly returning zero when the element is not found. 

However, the hints do mention that the function does not validate input types; it assumes valid input will be provided, which does not impact its correctness per the problem requirements outlined.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints do not contradict the original assessment, I concur with the original assessment.

Final: **True**
