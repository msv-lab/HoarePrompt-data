Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element, returning the count of occurrences of `element` within `tup`. It is correctly implemented using the `count()` method available for tuples in Python, which counts how many times a specified value appears in the tuple. 

The output hints indicate that the function correctly handles various scenarios, including when the element doesn’t exist in the tuple (returning zero) and cases where the element appears multiple times, which the provided assertions confirm. 

Since the problem description assumes valid input and the function is able to handle different data types within the tuple, there’s no indication of a case that it fails for given the constraints. Therefore, the implementation meets the required specifications for all potential cases.
