Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`element`) as parameters and uses the `count` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of `element` within `tup`. 

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: It correctly accepts a tuple and an element of any data type, in accordance with the problem description.
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The `tup.count(element)` method efficiently counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`. This directly addresses the task of counting occurrences as stated in the problem.

3. **Handling Non-Occurrences**: The program rightly handles the case where the `element` does not exist in the `tup`, returning `0`, which is the expected behavior.

4. **No Type Restrictions**: As per the assumption that inputs will always be valid, any deviation from expected types does not make the program incorrect. The function will simply return `0` if the element is not found, which satisfies the contract of counting occurrences.

Overall, because the function executes the counting of occurrences as specified without introducing any errors or unexpected behavior, it aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
