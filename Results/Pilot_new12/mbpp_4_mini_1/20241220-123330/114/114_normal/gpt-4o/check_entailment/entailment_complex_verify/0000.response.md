Final: **True**

The program correctly meets the problem description of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function `func_1` utilizes the built-in method `tuple.count(element)`, which accurately counts the number of times the specified element appears in the given tuple.

The annotations confirm the following:

1. The assertions correctly test the function with various inputs, including cases where the element is present multiple times and where it is absent.
2. The state of the program before the function call confirms that the inputs are of the expected types: `tup` is a tuple and `element` can indeed be of any data type.
3. The function handles the absence of the element appropriately by returning zero when the element is not found.

Given that the program works correctly under the stated assumptions of valid inputs and that it successfully adheres to its intended functionality as described in the problem, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate. The program functions as required without any edge case issues based on the assumption of valid inputs.
