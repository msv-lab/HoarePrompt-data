Final: **True**

The original assessment's conclusion is validated by both the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the mechanism to count the occurrences of an element within a tuple, leveraging the built-in method `tuple.count(element)`. 

The annotations confirm that prior to invoking the function, the inputs are properly described (a tuple and an element of any data type), and the function successfully returns the count as intended. The assertions provided further demonstrate the function's correct behavior under various test cases, including counting an absent element (4), a frequently appearing element (10), and another common element (8). 

Given all this, the function meets the specifications outlined in the problem description, and the original assessment that deemed the program correct is accurate. There are no edge cases overlooked according to the provided assumptions about valid input.
