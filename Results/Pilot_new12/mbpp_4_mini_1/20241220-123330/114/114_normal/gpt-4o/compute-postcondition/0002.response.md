Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `element`, which can be of any data type. It returns the count of occurrences of `element` within `tup`. The function effectively handles any tuple input, regardless of the data types contained within it, and correctly counts how many times `element` appears, including cases where `element` does not exist in `tup`, in which case it will return zero. There are no additional validations for the input types, meaning if `tup` is not a tuple or if `element` is of a type that cannot be evaluated in `tup`, the function will not raise an error, but it may return an unexpected count based on how Python handles these cases. Thus, the final output is the integer count of the specified `element` within the tuple `tup`.**
