The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, which can contain elements of any data type, and `element` can also be of any data type. After executing the function body, the function returns the count of occurrences of `element` within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and return the count of how many times `element` appears in `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, which is a tuple, and a parameter element of any data type, returning the count of occurrences of element in tup.**
