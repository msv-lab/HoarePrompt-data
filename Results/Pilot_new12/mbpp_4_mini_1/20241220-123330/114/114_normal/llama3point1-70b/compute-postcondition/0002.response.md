Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` of any datatype, and returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function will return `0`, indicating that there are no occurrences of `elem`. The function correctly handles different datatypes in `elem`, including cases where `elem` is not present in `tup`, and it accurately counts occurrences regardless of the order of the elements in the tuple. Since the function relies on the built-in `count` method of tuples, it does not have any additional logic for handling edge cases like counting complex objects or differentiating between different data representations of the same value. Overall, the function provides a straightforward way to determine the number of occurrences of an element within a tuple.**
