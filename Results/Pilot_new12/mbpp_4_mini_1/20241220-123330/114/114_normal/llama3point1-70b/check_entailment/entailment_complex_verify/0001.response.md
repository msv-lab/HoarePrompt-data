Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the function `func_1` based on the problem description. The program correctly implements the functionality of counting occurrences of an element in a tuple using Python's built-in `count` method, which is appropriate for this task.

The annotations reinforce the assessment by clearly describing the state of the program before the function call and confirming that the function handles various scenarios as described in the original assessment. The provided details about how the function behaves with different input cases (empty tuple, identical elements, absence of the element, and type differentiation) align perfectly with the expectations set forth in the problem description.

Since both the original assessment and the annotated version support the conclusion that the function behaves correctly under all specified conditions, the final assessment remains as **True**.
