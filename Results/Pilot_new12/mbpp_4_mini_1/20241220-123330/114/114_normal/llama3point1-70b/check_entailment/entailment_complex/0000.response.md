Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements defined in the problem description. 

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` is designed to take in a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`). The problem description specifies that `tup` must be a tuple and `elem` can be of any datatype. The program correctly accepts these inputs as required.

2. **Core Functionality**: The core functionality of the program is to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. The program uses the built-in `count` method available for tuples in Python, which is a direct and efficient way to achieve the desired counting.

3. **Return Value**: If `tup` is empty, the `count` method will naturally return `0`, as there are no occurrences of `elem`. This aligns with the problem description's expectation of returning `0` when an element is not present in the tuple.

4. **Handling Different Data Types**: The program correctly handles instances where `elem` might be of a different datatype than the elements in `tup`, and it can count occurrences accurately regardless of datatype.

5. **Edge Cases**: The explanation provided acknowledges that the `count` method will not have issues with more complex objects, unless those objects define their own equality operations. However, for the scope of the problem and given the assumption of valid inputs, this suffices. 

In summary, the function `func_1` meets all criteria set out in the problem description: it counts occurrences of the specified element within a tuple and provides the correct return value based on the input. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
