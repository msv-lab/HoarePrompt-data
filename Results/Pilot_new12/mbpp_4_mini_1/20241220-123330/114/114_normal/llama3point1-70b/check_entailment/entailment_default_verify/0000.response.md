Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description by using the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of an element in the provided tuple. The output hints confirm that the function can handle various scenarios, including when the element is absent, when the tuple is empty, and with differing data types for `elem`.

Additionally, the assessment notes that while the built-in `count` method does not include checks for complex objects or various representations of the same value, this is acceptable since the problem description does not call for such functionality, and valid inputs are assumed. Therefore, the program meets the problem description effectively and is correctly implemented.
