Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately counts the occurrences of an element regardless of its data type. The provided output hints affirm that the function correctly handles various cases, such as counting occurrences in an empty tuple (returning 0) and differentiating based on the presence of `elem`. Since it relies on the built-in functionality, it inherently manages edge cases like counting complex objects. This aligns with the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
