Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. This accurately fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description to count occurrences of a specified element in the given tuple.

Testing against various potential cases:

1. When the tuple is empty (e.g., `()`), counting any element should return `0`, which is expected.
2. For a tuple with identical elements (e.g., `(1, 1, 1)`), counting `1` should return `3`.
3. If an element not present in the tuple is counted (e.g., in `(1, 2, 3)`, count `4`), it should return `0`.
4. Counting different types (e.g., `(1, '1', 1.0)` for `1`) should correctly return `2` since `1` and `1.0` are considered the same when counting but `'1'` is not.

Thus, the implementation handles all possible cases specified by the problem description accurately. There are no edge cases or potential problems identified. Therefore, the function is correct.
