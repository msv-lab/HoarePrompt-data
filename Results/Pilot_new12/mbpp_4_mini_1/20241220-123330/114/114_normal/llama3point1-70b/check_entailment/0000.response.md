Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuple objects. This method is efficient and accurately returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. 

The program handles various cases, including:
1. When the element is present multiple times.
2. When the element is not present at all.
3. When the tuple is empty.
4. When the element is of a different data type than the elements in the tuple.

Since I cannot think of any edge cases where the function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
