Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it accurately counts the occurrences of `elem` in `tup` using the built-in `count` method for tuples.

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function is designed to accept a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`) of any datatype, as specified.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `tup.count(elem)` directly aligns with the requirement to count how many times `elem` appears in `tup`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the result of the count, which is exactly what is required according to the problem description.

Given the assumption that the inputs are valid, there are no edge cases being neglected. The function behaves correctly for any valid tuple and element as inputs. Thus, it fulfills the problem requirements completely.
