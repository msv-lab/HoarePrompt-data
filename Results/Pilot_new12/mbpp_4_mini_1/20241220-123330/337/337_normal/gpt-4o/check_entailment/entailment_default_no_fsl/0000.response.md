Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to sum unique integers in a list; however, it fails to meet the problem description's requirement regarding non-repeated elements. 

According to the problem description, the function should compute the sum of non-repeated elements. This means that if an integer appears more than once in the list, it should not contribute to the sum at all. For example, in the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the number `1` is repeated, and thus it should not be included in the sum. 

The implementation does not account for this logic because `set(lst)` only removes duplicates, resulting in a sum of all unique values, which does not adhere to the requirement of summing only non-repeated (non-duplicate) integers. 

Taking this into account, the examples provided in the output hints show that the function does not correctly handle cases with repeated elements:

- For the example `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])`, the expected output should consider only `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, resulting in a sum of `20`, not `21` as asserted.
- Similarly, for the other examples where duplicates exist, the assertions would fail based on the definition of non-repeated sums.

Thus, the program does not fulfill all the requirements of the problem description; hence, it is incorrect.
