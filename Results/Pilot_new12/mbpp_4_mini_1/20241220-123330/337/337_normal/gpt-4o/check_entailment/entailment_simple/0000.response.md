Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, as specified in the problem description. However, the implementation uses `set(lst)` to compute the sum, which returns the sum of unique elements regardless of whether they are repeated in the input list. This means that the function sums elements that appear more than once, which contradicts the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements.

For example:
- In the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the number `1` appears multiple times, so it should be considered as a repeated element and not included in the sum. The expected sum of non-repeated elements should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, but the program would return a sum of `21` instead, which includes repeated elements (1 is counted once).

Hence, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the problem description of summing only non-repeated elements.
