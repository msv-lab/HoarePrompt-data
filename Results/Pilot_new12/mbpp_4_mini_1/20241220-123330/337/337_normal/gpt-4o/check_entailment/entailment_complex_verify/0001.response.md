Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's behavior in relation to the problem description. The program's objective is to compute the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. However, the implementation uses `sum(set(lst))`, which sums all unique integers, not just those that are non-repeated. As demonstrated in the test cases, the results do not align with the expected output based on the definition of non-repeated elements.

- For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the expected sum of non-repeated elements is `20`, but the function would return `21`, incorrectly including the repeated `1`.
- For the input list `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the expected output is `57` (from non-repeated elements), but the function would return `71`.
- For the input list `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the expected output is `23`, while the function would incorrectly return `78`.

Thus, the annotated version does not change the original assessment, as it supports the conclusion that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Hence, the final conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
