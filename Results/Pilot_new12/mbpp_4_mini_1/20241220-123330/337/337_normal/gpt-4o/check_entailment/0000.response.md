The provided program attempts to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the way it is currently implemented using `sum(set(lst))` does not account for the requirement of finding only the non-repeated elements. Instead, it simply sums all unique elements, which includes repeated elements only once.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input case:

```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])
```

Here, the expected output for the non-repeated elements is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`. However, using the current implementation:

```python
sum(set([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])) == sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
```

This does not reflect the requirement of summing only the elements that are not repeated. The presence of `1`, which is repeated in the input list, would mean that its value should not be considered in the sum.

Therefore, due to the failure to correctly implement the logic of summing only non-repeated elements, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
