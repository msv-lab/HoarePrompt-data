To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to examine the problem description against the implementation. The task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Definition of Non-Repeated Elements
Non-repeated elements in a list are those which only appear once.

### Provided Test Cases
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the expected output is `21`. However, the only non-repeated numbers are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which sum to `20`. The program will incorrectly sum all unique numbers in the set which includes `1`, resulting in an incorrect sum of `21`.
2. For the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, again the non-repeated numbers should only be `[1, 9, 2, 45]`, summing to `57`. The implementation will incorrectly return `71` by summing the unique numbers including repeated ones.
3. Finally, for the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the non-repeated numbers are `[12, 9, 2]`, which sum to `23`, while the output would incorrectly return `78`.

### Analysis of Implementation
The implemented function uses `sum(set(lst))`. This calculation sums all unique values in the list as determined by `set()`, which does not account for whether the values are repeated or not. Therefore, the implementation does not adhere to the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements.

### Conclusion
Since the function fails to produce correct outputs for the provided test cases due to misunderstanding of what 'non-repeated' means, the overall correctness of the program is determined to be false.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure
For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the correct sum of non-repeated elements is `20`, but the function would incorrectly return `21`.
