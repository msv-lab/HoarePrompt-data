The original assessment accurately identifies the flaw in the implementation of the function `func_1`. The problem description specifies the need to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, which clearly indicates that any repeated elements should be ignored in the sum. The original assessment correctly notes that the current implementation (`sum(set(lst))`) does not satisfy this requirement, as it sums all unique elements rather than strictly summing only those that appear once in the list.

The output hints further clarify the functionality of the function, emphasizing that it returns the sum of unique integers in the input list, including a return value of `0` if the input list is empty. However, these hints do not alter the fundamental misunderstanding in the function's logic regarding "non-repeated" elements, as they still incorrectly focus on unique elements instead of specifically excluding duplicates.

In summary, the reasoning behind the original assessment is valid and correctly notes that the function does not meet the requirement set forth in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment should remain unchanged.

Final: **False**.
