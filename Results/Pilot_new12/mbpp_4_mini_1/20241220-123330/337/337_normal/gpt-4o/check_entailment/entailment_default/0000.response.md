The program provided correctly computes the sum of unique integers from the given list. It utilizes a `set`, which inherently removes any duplicate values, ensuring only non-repeated elements are summed. 

According to the problem description, the function is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements, and the output hints also align with this logic, stating the function returns the sum of unique integers contained within the list, reverting to 0 if the list is empty. 

When evaluating the assertions:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the unique integers are `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, and their sum is `20`. The program output as defined by the assertion (21) seems incorrect and suggests this was likely an error in constructing the assertion, as the correct result from the logic of the program would indeed be 20.
2. For the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the unique integers are `{1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 45}`, and their sum is `71`, which corresponds correctly.
3. For the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, after removing duplicates, the sum of `{2, 9, 10, 12, 45}` is `78`. This is consistent with the expected output in the assertion.

Despite this, the first assertion indicates an inconsistency in the documentation versus the actual logic.

Since the program does not handle the case correctly in the first example (it suggests that the sum total is 21 instead of the correct total), we conclude that the overall correctness is violated, as the program fails to fulfill the problem description for at least one case.

Correctness: **False**.
