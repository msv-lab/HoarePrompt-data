You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to examine the problem description against the implementation. The task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Definition of Non-Repeated Elements
Non-repeated elements in a list are those which only appear once.

### Provided Test Cases
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the expected output is `21`. However, the only non-repeated numbers are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which sum to `20`. The program will incorrectly sum all unique numbers in the set which includes `1`, resulting in an incorrect sum of `21`.
2. For the input `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, again the non-repeated numbers should only be `[1, 9, 2, 45]`, summing to `57`. The implementation will incorrectly return `71` by summing the unique numbers including repeated ones.
3. Finally, for the input `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the non-repeated numbers are `[12, 9, 2]`, which sum to `23`, while the output would incorrectly return `78`.

### Analysis of Implementation
The implemented function uses `sum(set(lst))`. This calculation sums all unique values in the list as determined by `set()`, which does not account for whether the values are repeated or not. Therefore, the implementation does not adhere to the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements.

### Conclusion
Since the function fails to produce correct outputs for the provided test cases due to misunderstanding of what 'non-repeated' means, the overall correctness of the program is determined to be false.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure
For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the correct sum of non-repeated elements is `20`, but the function would incorrectly return `21`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, `lst`, and returns the sum of unique integers contained within that list. Notably, if `lst` is empty, the function will return `0`, as the sum of an empty set of integers is zero. Additionally, the function disregards any duplicate integers in the input list, ensuring that only distinct values contribute to the sum. Overall, the final state after the program concludes is the total sum of the unique integers from the input list, or zero if the list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
