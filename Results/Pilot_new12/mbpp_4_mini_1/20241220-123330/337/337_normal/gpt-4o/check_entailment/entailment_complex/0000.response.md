Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the input list `lst`. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding of the Problem**: The problem requires a function that sums only the non-repeated elements in a list of integers. 

2. **Usage of `set`**: The program uses `set(lst)` to remove duplicates from the list. A set inherently only retains unique elements, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to consider only non-repeated integers. 

3. **Sum Calculation**: The function then uses `sum(set(lst))` to compute the total of these unique integers. 

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the input list is empty (`[]`), `set([])` yields an empty set, and `sum(empty set)` is `0`, fulfilling the requirement that if the list is empty, the function should return `0`.

Thus, the function accurately meets the specifications laid out in the problem description for all cases, including edge cases. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is indeed correct.
