The original assessment concluded that the program does not correctly sum the non-repeated elements in a list, underscoring that the implementation merely sums unique elements without checking their repetition status. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to sum only non-repeated elements.

Upon examining the annotated code, the assertions suggest expected outputs for lists, but they also further reinforce that the original implementation incorrectly accounts for repeated elements. The state provided indicates that the function `func_1` is returning the sum of unique integers in the list, which is not equivalent to summing only non-repeated values.

For example, in the initial case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])`, the expected output should be `20` (summing `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`), whereas the function incorrectly returns `21` by including `1`, which is repeated.

Consequently, the annotations do not provide evidence that alters the interpretation of the original assessment. The program simply does not fulfill the problem's requirements concerning non-repeated values as clearly stated in the problem description.

Final: **False**.
