The original assessment points out a significant flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the code currently uses `sum(set(lst))`, which only sums unique integers without excluding those that are repeated in the original list. 

The correctness analysis presented in the original assessment is reinforced by the annotations, which clarify that the function returns the sum of unique integers, rather than the sum of non-repeated integers. The definition of non-repeated elements indicates that any integer that appears more than once should not contribute to the final sum at all. For instance, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the number `1` should be excluded entirely because it is repeated, leading to the expected output of `20` (from `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6`), while the current implementation returns `21`.

Given that the implementation does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description—specifically, the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements—the original assessment is indeed accurate. 

Thus, based on the evidence from the annotations and the problem description, my final assessment of the program's correctness remains:

Final: **False**.
