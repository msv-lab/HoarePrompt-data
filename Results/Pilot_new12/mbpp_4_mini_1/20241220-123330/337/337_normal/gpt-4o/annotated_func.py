#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `lst`, and returns the sum of unique integers contained within that list. Notably, if `lst` is empty, the function will return `0`, as the sum of an empty set of integers is zero. Additionally, the function disregards any duplicate integers in the input list, ensuring that only distinct values contribute to the sum. Overall, the final state after the program concludes is the total sum of the unique integers from the input list, or zero if the list is empty.
