You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and sums the non-repeated (unique) elements from the given list. It uses a generator expression to filter out elements that occur exactly once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`) and then sums those elements with the `sum()` function.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can consider a few test cases:

1. For an input list like `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the unique element is `3`, so the output would be `3`.
2. For input list `[4, 5, 4, 6, 7]`, the unique elements are `5` and `6`, so the output would be `5 + 6 = 11`.
3. For an input list with all elements repeated, such as `[2, 2, 2]`, there are no unique elements, so the output will be `0`.
4. An empty list `[]` also returns `0`, since there are no elements to consider.

No potential edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description can be identified. Therefore, the function appears to be correctly implemented for the specified task.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the integers in `lst` that appear only once. If all integers in `lst` are duplicates or the list is empty, the function returns 0. The logic relies on counting occurrences of each integer in the list, which may not be efficient for large lists but is functional for determining unique integers. Edge cases include handling an empty list, a list where all elements are the same, or where all elements occur more than once.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
