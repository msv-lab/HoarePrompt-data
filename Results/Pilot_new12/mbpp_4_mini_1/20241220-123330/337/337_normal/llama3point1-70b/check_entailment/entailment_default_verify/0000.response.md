Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness as **True** is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to meet the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The use of `lst.count(i) == 1` allows the program to accurately identify and sum only those integers that appear once in the list, as detailed in the output hints.

Furthermore, the output hints clarify that the function properly returns 0 when there are no non-repeated integers or if the list is empty, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description. While the method used is not the most efficient for large lists, it is functional and meets the requirements specified. Therefore, no cases can be identified where the logic fails to fulfill the problem's intent. Thus, I maintain that the final assessment of the program's correctness is True.
