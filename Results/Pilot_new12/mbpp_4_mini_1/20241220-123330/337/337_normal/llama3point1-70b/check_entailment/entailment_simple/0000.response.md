Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Identification of Non-Repeated Elements**: The code uses a generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1, which identifies elements that do not repeat.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The `sum()` function then aggregates the identified non-repeated elements. Therefore, the result is the correct sum of all unique elements in the list that appear exactly once.

3. **Valid Assumptions**: The problem statement indicates that input will always be valid, implying the function is not expected to handle error cases like empty lists or invalid data types. Given this assumption, the program correctly follows the expected logic defined in the problem description for valid input cases.

4. **Behavior**: The function will produce:
   - Correct sums for lists with various integers, including cases with all elements being unique, some duplicates, or all elements being the same.

Thus, the program effectively fulfills the requirement to compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the input list `lst` as described in the problem statement.
