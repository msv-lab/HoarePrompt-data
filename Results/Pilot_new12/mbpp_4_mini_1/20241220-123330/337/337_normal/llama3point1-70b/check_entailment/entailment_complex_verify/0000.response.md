Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program adheres to the problem description of calculating the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The annotated version clarifies that the function effectively sums integers that appear only once by checking each element's count. It also mentions that the program will return 0 for an empty list or if all elements are duplicates, which aligns with the expected behavior. Therefore, the logic utilized in the function correctly realizes the goal set forth in the problem description, confirming the original assessment of correctness.
