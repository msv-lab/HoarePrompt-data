Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and sums the non-repeated (unique) elements from the given list. It uses a generator expression to filter out elements that occur exactly once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`) and then sums those elements with the `sum()` function.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can consider a few test cases:

1. For an input list like `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the unique element is `3`, so the output would be `3`.
2. For input list `[4, 5, 4, 6, 7]`, the unique elements are `5` and `6`, so the output would be `5 + 6 = 11`.
3. For an input list with all elements repeated, such as `[2, 2, 2]`, there are no unique elements, so the output will be `0`.
4. An empty list `[]` also returns `0`, since there are no elements to consider.

No potential edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description can be identified. Therefore, the function appears to be correctly implemented for the specified task.
