Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotated code confirms that the program checks each element in the list and sums only those that appear exactly once, which adheres precisely to the specified requirements. The annotation also clarifies the state of the program prior to execution and confirms the correctness of the return value. Therefore, based on the provided evidence and reasoning, the program is correct for its intended purpose.
