Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it adheres to those requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst)` is intended to sum the non-repeated (i.e., unique) elements within a list of integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Logic Used**: The function utilizes a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks the count of each element using `lst.count(i)`. If the count is equal to 1 (indicating that the element is unique), it includes that element in the sum being calculated. This is precisely what is needed to sum non-repeated elements.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If `lst` is empty, `sum()` will return 0, adhering to the requirement that if all integers are duplicates or the list is empty, the result should be 0.
   - If all integers in the list are duplicates, the generator expression will yield no elements, leading to a sum of 0, which is again correct as per the specification.

4. **Efficiency Consideration**: Although the method may not be the most efficient due to the repeated counting of elements for large lists, the implementation correctly fulfills the stated requirements effectively for defining inputs.

In summary, the function accurately computes the sum of non-repeated integers from the input list, adheres to the expected behavior described in the problem statement, and properly handles edge cases as outlined. Therefore, the program is determined to be correct, resulting in the output of True.
