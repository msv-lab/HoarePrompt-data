Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the program and confirm that the function will return the appropriate results for various input scenarios:

1. It identifies integers in the input list that occur exactly once (`lst.count(i) == 1`).
2. It sums these unique integers using the `sum()` function.
3. The function will return `0` when no unique integers are found or if the input list is empty, which is consistent with the expectations.

Furthermore, given the assumption of valid inputs, the function's efficiency with larger lists is acknowledged in the annotations but does not affect its correctness. Thus, the original assessment of correctness remains justified and accurate given the provided evidence and reasoning.
