Final: **True**

The program `func_1` successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find and sum the non-repeated elements in a given list of integers. The original assessment correctly identifies this functionality.

The output hints further confirm this behavior, indicating that:
- The function does return the sum of unique integers in the list.
- It correctly returns `0` for empty lists or lists where all integers are duplicated.
- The code may not be the most efficient for large lists but functions correctly to meet the described purpose.

Considering the test cases and the thorough explanation provided in the original assessment, all anticipated edge cases are well-managed. Thus, the assertion that the function is correct remains valid, solidifying its correctness.
