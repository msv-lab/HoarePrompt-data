The program provided is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The implementation uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst` and checks if the count of `i` in the list is equal to 1 using `lst.count(i)`. If it is, that value is included in the sum.

Based on the output hints, the logic is centered around counting occurrences of each integer in the list, which may not be efficient for large lists, but the functionality seems valid. The edge cases mentioned in the output hints involve handling scenarios such as an empty list or lists where all elements are the same.

However, one potential issue arises with performance and functionality in specific cases. While the prompt states that the function operates correctly, it does not specifically address the handling of large lists efficiently, nor does it indicate any other logical flaws. The sum will still return 0 for cases when all integers in `lst` are duplicates or if the list is empty, thus satisfying the main requirement.

After examining the logic and the functionality in line with the problem description, I cannot find a case where the functionality of the program doesn't work according to defined requirements. For valid inputs, it consistently produces the correct outputs.

As such, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
