Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly sums the non-repeated elements in the provided list. It iterates through each element in `lst` and uses `lst.count(i)` to check if the element `i` appears exactly once in the list. If it does, it includes that element in the summation. No cases can be identified where this logic fails, as it adheres to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
