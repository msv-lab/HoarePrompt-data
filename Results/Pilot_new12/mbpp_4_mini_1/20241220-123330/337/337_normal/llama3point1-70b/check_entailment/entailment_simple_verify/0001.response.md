Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` properly implements the required logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list. 

The annotations confirm that the function operates with a list of integers and correctly computes the sum of the integers that appear only once by utilizing a generator expression that filters for unique elements (`lst.count(i) == 1`). 

The test cases and edge scenarios provided in the original assessment further reinforce the correctness of the function, demonstrating consistent expected outputs, including handling of lists with repeated elements and empty lists. Thus, all evidence points to the program accurately meeting the problem's requirements.
