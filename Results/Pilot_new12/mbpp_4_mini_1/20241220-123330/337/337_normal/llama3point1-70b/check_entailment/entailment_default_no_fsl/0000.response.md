Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies non-repeated elements in the input list and sums them as described in the problem statement. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list, checking the count of each element. Only elements that appear exactly once in the list contribute to the sum.

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function handles various edge cases effectively:

1. If the list is empty, the sum will rightly be 0.
2. If all integers in the list are duplicates, the output will also be 0.
3. If there are some unique integers in the list, only those integers will be included in the sum.

Thus, the logic is sound and covers the problem description appropriately for all potential cases specified. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
