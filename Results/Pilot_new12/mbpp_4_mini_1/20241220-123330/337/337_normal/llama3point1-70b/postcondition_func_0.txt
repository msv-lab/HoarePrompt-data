The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the integers in `lst` that appear only once. If all integers in `lst` are duplicates or the list is empty, the function returns 0. The logic relies on counting occurrences of each integer in the list, which may not be efficient for large lists but is functional for determining unique integers. Edge cases include handling an empty list, a list where all elements are the same, or where all elements occur more than once.
