Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter and return all even integers from that list. 

The condition `num % 2 == 0` accurately checks if each number is even, and the list comprehension efficiently collects all such numbers into a new list, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to "find even numbers from a list of numbers."

Since the problem description specifies that the function should return a list of even numbers and the implementation fulfills this requirement correctly for any valid list of integers, we can confirm that the program is correct.
