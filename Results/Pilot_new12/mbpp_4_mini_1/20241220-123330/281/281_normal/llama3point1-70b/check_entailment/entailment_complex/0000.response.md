Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (referred to as `numbers`) as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the list. It checks whether each number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If the condition is satisfied, the number is included in the new list that the function returns.

Here is why the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is defined to accept a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description. Even if the input is an empty list, the function will correctly return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The use of a list comprehension effectively filters out the even numbers from the input list, following the requirement of returning only even integers.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list containing only the even integers, which is exactly what is specified in the problem description.

4. **No Side Effects**: The original input list is not modified; the function focuses solely on generating a new list based on the input.

Given all these points, the function adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description, thus making it correct.
