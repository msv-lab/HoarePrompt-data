Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find even numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`, checking if the number is even (`num % 2 == 0`). The output hints clarify that the function returns a new list containing only the even integers, and if there are no even integers or the list is empty, it will return an empty list. Since the program does not modify the original input list and correctly handles all potential cases outlined in the problem description, it is confirmed to be correct.
