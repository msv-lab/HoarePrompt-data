Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly identifies even numbers from a list. The implementation uses list comprehension to filter out numbers that are even (i.e., numbers where `num % 2 == 0`). This will handle all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with negative numbers. It will also return an empty list when there are no even numbers, which meets the problem description accurately. Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected.
