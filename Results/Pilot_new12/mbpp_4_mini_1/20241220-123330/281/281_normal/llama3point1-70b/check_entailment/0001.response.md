Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds even numbers from a list of numbers using a list comprehension that filters out odd numbers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). It will work for any list composed of integers, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. 

For instance, given the input list `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, the program will return `[-2, 0, 2]`, which are the even numbers in the list. There are no edge cases regarding integer inputs that the code does not handle correctly; hence the function meets the problem requirements in all scenarios that involve lists of numbers.
