The program provided correctly fulfills the problem description of finding even numbers from a list. The original assessment states the correctness is **True**, and upon reviewing the annotations, they support this assessment. 

The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and uses list comprehension to efficiently filter and return only the even integers from that list. Additionally, the annotations explain that if there are no even integers or if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior specified in the problem description.

The annotations provide a clear understanding of the function's logic and confirm that it does not modify the original list, further strengthening the correctness claim. The assurance that the input will always be valid means that edge cases, which might typically require error handling (like negative numbers or non-integer inputs), do not need to be considered as concerns here.

Given these points, the original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the annotations and the problem description.

Final: **True**
