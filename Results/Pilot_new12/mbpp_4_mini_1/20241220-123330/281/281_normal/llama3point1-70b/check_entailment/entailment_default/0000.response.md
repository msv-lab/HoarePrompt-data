Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the provided list of integers. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through each number in the input list, checks if it is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, and returns a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy this condition. The output hints confirm the correct behavior of the function: it returns a new list with even integers and leaves the original list unchanged. Additionally, the function is capable of handling all potential cases as described, including cases where there are no even integers or when the list is empty. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem description accurately.
