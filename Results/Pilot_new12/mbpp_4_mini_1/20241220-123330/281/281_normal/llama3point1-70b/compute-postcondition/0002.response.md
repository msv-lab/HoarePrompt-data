Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers named `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the input list. If the input list contains no even integers or is empty, the returned list will also be empty. The function does not modify the original input list and is focused solely on filtering the input based on evenness.**
