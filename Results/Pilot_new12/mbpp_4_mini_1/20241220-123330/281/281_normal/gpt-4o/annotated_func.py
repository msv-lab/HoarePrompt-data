#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of all even integers from the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list of all even integers from the list. It does not handle cases where `numbers` may be empty or not a list; thus, if an empty list is provided, the function will return an empty list. If the input is not a list of integers, the function may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results. The function operates on the entire list, filtering out only even integers, and maintains the order of the original list in the returned result.
