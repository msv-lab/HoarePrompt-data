The provided program `func_1` takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers. The program uses a list comprehension to perform this filtering, which is a valid approach for this task.

The output hints suggest that the function will return an empty list if provided with an empty list (`[]`), which is indeed expected behavior. Since the function uses a list comprehension that evaluates every element in `numbers`, if `numbers` is empty, there are no elements to evaluate, resulting in an empty list.

Additionally, the hints mention that the function may not handle cases where `numbers` is not a list or contains non-integer types. However, it is stated that we assume the input will always be valid, and the function operates correctly if inputs conform to the expected format (a list of integers).

The function also maintains the order of the original list in the returned result while filtering out only even integers, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the function works correctly for all valid inputs (as per the assumption), and it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description without missing any edge cases for valid inputs, we can conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
