Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by defining a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers (`numbers`) as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the input list. 

The logic used in the function is as follows:
- It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the `numbers` list.
- For each number, it checks if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).
- If the number is even, it is included in the resulting list.

The assertions provided confirm that the function produces the expected output for several test cases:
- For an input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `[2, 4]`, which correctly identifies the even numbers.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, accurately capturing all even numbers.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it outputs `[8, 12]`, again correctly identifying the even integers.

As the function handles the described scenario of filtering even numbers from a list of integers correctly and efficiently, it meets the specified requirements of the problem description without any omissions or errors. Therefore, the program is correct.
