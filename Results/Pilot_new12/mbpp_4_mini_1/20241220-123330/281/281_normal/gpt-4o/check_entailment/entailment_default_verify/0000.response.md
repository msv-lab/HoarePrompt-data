Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a given list of integers, fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description. It filters the list using a list comprehension, accurately returning only the even integers. The provided test assertions validate this functionality, demonstrating that the function produces the expected results for various inputs.

Additionally, while the output hints indicate that the function does not handle scenarios such as an empty list or non-list input, the problem description assures that the input will be valid. Since all given test cases confirm the correctness of the outputs, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains valid in the context provided. The function behaves correctly under the assumed valid input conditions.
