Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find and return even numbers from a list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers` and includes only those integers that satisfy the condition of being even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).

Key points that affirm the correctness of the function:

1. **Input Type**: The problem description assumes that the input will always be a valid list of integers, thus the function does not require explicit validation for the type of input. This assumption aligns with the task that we have been instructed to make.

2. **Output**: The function outputs a list of integers that are even, which meets the requirement of the problem description. The function has been tested with assertions, demonstrating that it produces the correct output for the specified examples:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`
   - `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`
   - `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: Although the program's documentation mentions it does not account for all potential edge cases (such as empty lists), our assumption clarifies that valid input will be provided, thus fulfilling the expectations set by the problem description.

Because of these points, we can conclude that `func_1` is correct as it meets the goal of extracting even numbers from a list of integers as outlined in the problem description.
