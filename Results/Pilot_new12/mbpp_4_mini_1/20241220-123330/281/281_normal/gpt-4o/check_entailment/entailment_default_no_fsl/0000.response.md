Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find even numbers from a list of integers as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers and uses a list comprehension to return all even integers while maintaining their original order. The assertions provided check for various cases where even numbers are identified correctly.

According to the output hints, the function does return an empty list for an empty input list, which is the expected behavior. Additionally, the assumption is made that valid inputs will be provided, meaning the function does not need to handle inputs that are not lists or contain non-integer elements.

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements as described and handles the expected input scenarios correctly, the output is marked as correct.
