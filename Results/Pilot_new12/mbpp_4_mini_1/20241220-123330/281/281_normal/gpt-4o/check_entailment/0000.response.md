Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from the provided list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to filter and return only those numbers that are even (i.e., those where `num % 2 == 0`). 

The test cases provided in the assertions confirm its correctness:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which includes all even numbers.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it returns `[8, 12]`, accurately identifying the even numbers.

In all potential cases and given the nature of the logic, it successfully meets the problem's requirements. Thus, the function is validated to be working as expected for various inputs.
