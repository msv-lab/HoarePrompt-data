Explanation: The code implementation correctly computes the cumulative product of all the numbers in the list and divides it by the length of the list to return the average of the products, as specified in the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, aligning with the provided definition. 

While the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list contains zeros, the problem description states that the input list is guaranteed to be non-empty and only expects either integers or floats as inputs. Given these assumptions, the function will not encounter issues with empty lists or invalid input types, thus maintaining correctness for the valid cases it is designed to handle. 

In this context, if the input is as described (non-empty list of numbers), the function works as intended and adheres to the problem specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
