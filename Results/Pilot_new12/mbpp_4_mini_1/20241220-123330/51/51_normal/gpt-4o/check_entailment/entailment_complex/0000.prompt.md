You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a non-empty list of integers or floats.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `num` is the last element of `numbers`.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result which is equal to product divided by the number of elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats) as input, computes the cumulative product of all the elements in the list, and then divides this product by the total number of elements in the list. The final output is the average of the products, which is returned as the result. This function does not handle cases where the input list might contain zeros, which would cause the product to be zero, leading to misleading results. Additionally, if the input list is empty, there would be a division by zero error, although the precondition states the list is non-empty. Therefore, while the function is designed to calculate the average of products of the elements, it lacks checks for potential edge cases such as handling zero values or unexpected inputs outside the specified type.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
