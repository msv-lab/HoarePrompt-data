You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case where the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will lead to a division by zero error when trying to calculate `result = product / len(numbers)`. This violates the requirement that the function should work for all potential cases, including edge cases. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, confirming that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a non-empty list of integers or floats.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `num` is the last element of `numbers`.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result which is equal to product divided by the number of elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats) as input, computes the cumulative product of all the elements in the list, and then divides this product by the total number of elements in the list. The final output is the average of the products, which is returned as the result. This function does not handle cases where the input list might contain zeros, which would cause the product to be zero, leading to misleading results. Additionally, if the input list is empty, there would be a division by zero error, although the precondition states the list is non-empty. Therefore, while the function is designed to calculate the average of products of the elements, it lacks checks for potential edge cases such as handling zero values or unexpected inputs outside the specified type.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
