Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle the case of receiving an empty list. The annotations explicitly state that before the function call, it assumes that `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats. However, in reality, when considering the function's robustness, it should also account for the possibility of being called with an empty list, which would lead to a division by zero error. Since the problem description requires the function to multiply all the numbers in the list and divide by the length of the list, an empty list scenario directly contradicts this requirement. Hence, the correctness of the program is evaluated as false.
