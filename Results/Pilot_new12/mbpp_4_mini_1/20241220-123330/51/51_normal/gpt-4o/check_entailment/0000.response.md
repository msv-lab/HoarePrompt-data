Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to multiply all the numbers in the input list and then divide the result by the length of the list. However, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would result in a division by zero error.

For example:
- If the input is an empty list `()`, an exception will be raised when trying to execute `result = product / len(numbers)` because `len(numbers)` will be `0`.

Since there is at least one input case (an empty list) for which the program does not function correctly, the correctness of the program is evaluated as false.
