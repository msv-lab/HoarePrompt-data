Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case where the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will lead to a division by zero error when trying to calculate `result = product / len(numbers)`. This violates the requirement that the function should work for all potential cases, including edge cases. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, confirming that the program is incorrect.
