Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of input lists containing zeros correctly. If a list contains a zero, the cumulative product will be zero, and when this value is divided by the length of the list, the result will also be zero. This can be misleading, as it does not represent the average of the products correctly since the product was impacted by the presence of zero.

For example, if the input is `(0, 2, 3)`, the expected output should reflect that any inclusion of zero renders the product to zero, hence the result would also be zero, which might not be an accurate representation of the average based on the other values in the list. Consequently, the function does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
