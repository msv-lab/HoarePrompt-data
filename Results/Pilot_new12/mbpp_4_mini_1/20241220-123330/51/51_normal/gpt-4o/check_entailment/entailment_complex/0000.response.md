Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the specifications of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that computes the product of all elements in a non-empty list of numbers and then divides that product by the length of the list, effectively calculating the average of the products.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validity**: The function expects a non-empty list of integers or floats, which aligns with the problem description's requirement.

2. **Product Calculation**: The loop iterates through each number in the list, maintaining a cumulative product in the variable `product`. This accurately reflects the requirement to multiply all numbers in the provided list.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product of all numbers, the program divides that product by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`), which satisfies the requirement to divide the product by the number of elements in the list.

4. **Return Value**: The final result, which is returned, is the average of the products, as specified.

5. **Edge Cases Handling**: Although the program does not explicitly handle cases such as multiplication by zero leading to a product of zero, the problem description allows for the assumption that valid input will always be provided. Thus, the function is deemed correct within the provided constraints.

In conclusion, based on the given problem description, the function correctly computes the desired output for all valid inputs while adhering to the specified requirements.
