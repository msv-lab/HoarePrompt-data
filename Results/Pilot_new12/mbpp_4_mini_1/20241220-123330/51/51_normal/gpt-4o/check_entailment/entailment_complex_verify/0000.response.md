Final: **True**

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is incorrect due to its inability to handle empty lists, leading to a division by zero error. However, the annotations clearly indicate that the input to the function is assumed to be a non-empty list of integers or floats. Given that assumption holds true based on the problem description, the function would operate correctly within the defined constraints.

The provided assertions validate the function's correctness for valid non-empty inputs, and the logic for calculating the product and dividing by the length of the list is accurate. Additionally, while the original assessment raised concerns about handling zeros and edge cases, those scenarios fall outside the assumed valid input conditions.

Thus, under the assumption that the input will be valid (non-empty) as stated, the function behaves correctly, and the original assessment does not accurately reflect its correctness. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
