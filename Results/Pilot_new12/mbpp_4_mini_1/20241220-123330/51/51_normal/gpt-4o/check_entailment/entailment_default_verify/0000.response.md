Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the function `func_1`, which is its inability to handle an empty input list. According to the problem description, the function must multiply all numbers in the list and divide the result by the length of the list. However, if the list is empty, executing `result = product / len(numbers)` will indeed raise a division by zero error. 

While the output hints seem to imply that the function assumes non-empty input, they do not eliminate the fact that the function as it currently stands cannot robustly handle all valid cases outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment that the program's correctness is false remains valid, as there is a legitimate scenario (an empty input list) where the function would fail. Thus, the program does not meet the complete requirements set out in the problem description.
