Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the edge case of an empty input list, which would lead to a division by zero error during the computation of the result. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function is designed to work with a non-empty list, but it fails to provide any handling or exception for situations where the list may not meet this precondition. Consequently, although the function works correctly for non-empty input lists, the lack of robustness against an empty input violates the requirement for the function to be correct across all potential cases, including edge cases. Therefore, the original conclusion that the program is incorrect holds true.
