Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input and Initialization**: The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of numbers (which can be integers or floats), as stated in the problem description.

2. **Product Calculation**: The program initializes a variable `product` to 1. It then iterates through each number in the `numbers` list, multiplying them together to calculate their product. This step effectively computes the result required in the problem description.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product of all elements, the program divides this product by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`. This aligns exactly with the requirement to "multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list."

4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the computed `result`, which is the product divided by the length of the input list.

Given these points, the implementation successfully adheres to the problem description across all expected scenarios outlined in the assertions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
