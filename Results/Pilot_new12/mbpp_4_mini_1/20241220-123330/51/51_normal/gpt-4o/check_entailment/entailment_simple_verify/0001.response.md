Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because while the provided annotations clarify that the program handles non-empty lists correctly, they do not address the crucial aspect that the function does not handle the case when the input is empty. The problem description requires the program to work for all potential cases, including edge cases. As stated, if `func_1([])` were to be called, it would result in a `ZeroDivisionError` due to the division by zero when trying to calculate `result = product / len(numbers)`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of robustness for all inputs, confirming its incorrectness.
