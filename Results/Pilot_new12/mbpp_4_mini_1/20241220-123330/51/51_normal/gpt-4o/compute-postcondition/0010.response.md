The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a non-empty list that can contain either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it calculates the product of all the elements in the list and divides that product by the number of elements in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of integers or floats and return the result of the product of the elements divided by the count of those elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats, and returns the product of the elements divided by the number of elements in the list.**
