The variable `result` is assigned the value of `product / len(numbers)`. The value of `product` is already given as the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, and `len(numbers)` gives the count of elements in `numbers`, which is a non-empty list. The values of the other variables (`numbers`, `product`, and `num`) remain unchanged but provide necessary context for understanding `result`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the result variable calculated based on the existing values of `product` and `len(numbers)`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `num` is the last element of `numbers`, `result` is equal to `product / len(numbers)`**.
