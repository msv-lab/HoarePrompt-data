The value of `product` is updated to be the product of its current value (which is 1) and `num`, the first element of the `numbers` list. Since `num` is the first element, the value of `product` will be equal to `num`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats, `product` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element of the numbers list**.
