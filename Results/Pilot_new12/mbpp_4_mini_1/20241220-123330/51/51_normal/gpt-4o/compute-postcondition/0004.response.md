`product` is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. The value of `product` is initially equal to the first element of `numbers`, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`. Therefore, after execution, `product` will be the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
