According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the list is stated to be non-empty, the loop can execute. Before entering the loop, the `product` is initialized to 1. So for the loop to be executed correctly, we need to ensure that `num` is set as the first element of the `numbers` list on the first iteration. 

State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floats, `product` is 1, `num` is the first element of the numbers list**
