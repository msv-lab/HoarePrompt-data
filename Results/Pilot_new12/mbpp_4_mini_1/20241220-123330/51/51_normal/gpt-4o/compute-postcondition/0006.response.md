The code `product *= num` updates the value of `product` by multiplying it with `num`. Given that `product` is initially equal to the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`, and `num` is the third element, the new value for `product` becomes the original value of `product` multiplied by `num`. As a result, the value of `product` is changed but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Assuming `numbers` contains at least three elements, let's denote the first element of `numbers` as `a`, the second as `b`, and the third as `c`. Initially, `product` is equal to `a * b`, and `num` is equal to `c`. 

So after executing the code, the updated value of `product` can be expressed as:

\[ \text{new\_product} = (a \times b) \times c \]

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements; `product` is now equal to the product of all three elements of `numbers` (first, second, and third), and `num` is the third element of `numbers`.**
