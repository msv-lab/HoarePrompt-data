Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats) as input, computes the cumulative product of all the elements in the list, and then divides this product by the total number of elements in the list. The final output is the average of the products, which is returned as the result. This function does not handle cases where the input list might contain zeros, which would cause the product to be zero, leading to misleading results. Additionally, if the input list is empty, there would be a division by zero error, although the precondition states the list is non-empty. Therefore, while the function is designed to calculate the average of products of the elements, it lacks checks for potential edge cases such as handling zero values or unexpected inputs outside the specified type.**
