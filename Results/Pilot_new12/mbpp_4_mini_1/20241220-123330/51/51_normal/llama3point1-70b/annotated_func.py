#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of the elements in `numbers`, calculated as the product of all elements divided by the length of the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list, returning the result. However, this method for calculating an "average" is incorrect; it does not yield the mathematical average (sum divided by count) of the elements in the list. If the list contains zero, the product will be zero, leading to a return value of zero regardless of the other elements. The function also does not handle cases where `numbers` contains non-numeric values or is not a list, which could lead to runtime errors.
