According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the list is not empty, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `product` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num` must correspond to the first element of the `numbers` list initially, and `product` starts at 1.

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list**
