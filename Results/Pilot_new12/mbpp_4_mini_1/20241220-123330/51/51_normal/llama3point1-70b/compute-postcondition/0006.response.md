The variable `product` is updated to be the product of its current value and the value of `num`, which is the third element of the `numbers` list. The previous value of `product` is retained, and the new value of `product` becomes `product * num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `product * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of the `numbers` list**.
