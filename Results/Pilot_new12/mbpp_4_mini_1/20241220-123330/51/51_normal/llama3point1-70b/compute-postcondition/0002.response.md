The variable `product` is multiplied by `num`, which is the first element of the `numbers` list. Since `product` starts at 1 and `num` holds a specific value, `product` will now equal `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `product` is now equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, and `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list.**
