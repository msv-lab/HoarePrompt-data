The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list that contains either integers or floats, and this list is guaranteed to be not empty. After executing the function body, it calculates the average of the elements in `numbers` by taking the product of all elements and dividing it by the length of the `numbers` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers or floats and return the average of the elements in that list calculated as the product of all elements divided by the number of elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats, and returns the average of the elements in the list calculated as the product of all elements divided by the length of the list.**
