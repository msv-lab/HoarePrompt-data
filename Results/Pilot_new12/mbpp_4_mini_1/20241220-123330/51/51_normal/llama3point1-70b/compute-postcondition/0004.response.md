The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it by the value of `num`. Since `num` is defined as the second element of the `numbers` list, `product` now becomes equal to `product * num`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `product * num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list**.
