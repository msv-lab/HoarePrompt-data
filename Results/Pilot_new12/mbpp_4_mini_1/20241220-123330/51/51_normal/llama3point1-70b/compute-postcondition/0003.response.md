According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list still contains more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list, which means that the loop has processed this first element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` must be updated to the next element in the list, and the `numbers` list must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list**
