Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list, returning the result. However, this method for calculating an "average" is incorrect; it does not yield the mathematical average (sum divided by count) of the elements in the list. If the list contains zero, the product will be zero, leading to a return value of zero regardless of the other elements. The function also does not handle cases where `numbers` contains non-numeric values or is not a list, which could lead to runtime errors.**
