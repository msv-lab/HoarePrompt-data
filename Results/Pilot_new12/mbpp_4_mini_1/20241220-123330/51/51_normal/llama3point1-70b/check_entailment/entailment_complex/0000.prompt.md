You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of the elements in `numbers`, calculated as the product of all elements divided by the length of the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list, returning the result. However, this method for calculating an "average" is incorrect; it does not yield the mathematical average (sum divided by count) of the elements in the list. If the list contains zero, the product will be zero, leading to a return value of zero regardless of the other elements. The function also does not handle cases where `numbers` contains non-numeric values or is not a list, which could lead to runtime errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
