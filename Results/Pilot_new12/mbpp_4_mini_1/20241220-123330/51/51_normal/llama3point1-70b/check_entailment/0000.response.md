Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, the code will attempt to perform division by zero when calculating `product / len(numbers)`, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of correctly handling all potential cases.
