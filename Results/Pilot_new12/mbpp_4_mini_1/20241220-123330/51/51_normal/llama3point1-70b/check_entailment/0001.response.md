To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the function step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The function is required to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.

### Program Logic:
The function `func_1(numbers)` does the following:

1. Initializes `product` to 1.
2. Iterates over each number in the list `numbers` and multiplies it with `product`.
3. After the loop, it divides `product` by the length of `numbers` and returns the result.

### Edge Cases:
Now let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Empty List**: 
   - If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function will attempt to use `len(numbers)` which is 0.
   - This will result in a division by zero error (`ZeroDivisionError`), as we cannot divide by zero.

2. **List with One Element**:
   - If the input list is `[3]`, the result should be `3 / 1 = 3.0`, which the function handles correctly.
   
3. **List with Multiple Numbers (Including Zero)**:
   - For a list like `[1, 2, 3, 0]`, the product would be `0`, and dividing by the length (4) should yield `0.0`, which is handled correctly by the function.

4. **Negative and Positive Numbers**:
   - A mix of negative and positive numbers (e.g., `[-2, -2, 2]`) would yield a product of `8`, and dividing by the length (3) would produce `8 / 3 = 2.666...`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The function fails to handle the case where the input is an empty list, leading to a division by zero error. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
