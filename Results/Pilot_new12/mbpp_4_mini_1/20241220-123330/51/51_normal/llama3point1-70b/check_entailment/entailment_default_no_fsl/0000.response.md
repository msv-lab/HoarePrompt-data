Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly calculates the average by multiplying all elements together and then dividing by the length of the list, which does not yield the mathematical average (which should be the sum of elements divided by the count). If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, leading to an incorrect answer. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the list contains non-numeric values, which could lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the problem description's requirement accurately for all potential cases.
