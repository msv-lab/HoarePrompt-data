The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `lst` that can contain any elements, and an integer `L` which is a non-negative integer constrained such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. After executing the function body, it returns two slices of the list `lst`: the first slice spans from the start of `lst` to index `L` (exclusive), and the second slice spans from index `L` to the end of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return two slices of the list based on the integer index provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns two slices of the list: the first slice from the start to index `L` (exclusive), and the second slice from index `L` to the end of the list.**
