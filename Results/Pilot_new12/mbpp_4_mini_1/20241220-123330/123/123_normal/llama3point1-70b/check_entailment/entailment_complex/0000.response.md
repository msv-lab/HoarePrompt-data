Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's how:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`. The annotation confirms that these inputs meet the conditions: `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. Thus, the function is guaranteed to receive valid inputs according to the problem description.

2. **Output Requirements**: The function splits the list into two parts:
   - The first part contains elements from the start of the list up to index `L` (exclusive), achieved through the slice `lst[:L]`.
   - The second part contains elements from index `L` to the end of the list, done by the slice `lst[L:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately:
   - If `L` is 0, `lst[:0]` returns an empty list, and `lst[0:]` returns the entire list.
   - If `L` equals the length of `lst`, `lst[:len(lst)]` returns the entire list and `lst[len(lst):]` returns an empty list.

Overall, the program fully meets every requirement outlined in the problem description for any valid inputs. Therefore, the output is confirmed to be correct.
