Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. According to the problem, it needs to split the list into two parts: one part having a length of `L`, and the other part containing the remaining elements of the list.

1. The slicing operation `lst[:L]` creates the first part of the list, which includes elements from index `0` to `L-1` (exclusive of index `L`), resulting in a sublist of length `L`.
2. The slicing operation `lst[L:]` creates the second part of the list, which includes all elements starting from index `L` up to the end of the list.

Given that `L` is always a non-negative integer and satisfies the condition `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, the function ensures that:
- When `L` is `0`, it returns an empty list for the first part (`[]`) and the entire list for the second part.
- When `L` equals the length of the list, it returns the entire list in the first part and an empty list for the second part.

Thus, the program handles the requirements specified by the problem description for all valid input cases, and it meets the conditions described without any issues.
