Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description. The function `func_1` effectively handles the task of splitting the list `lst` based on the integer `L` as specified. The annotated version corroborates this by confirming the preconditions that `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer within the valid range. 

The various test cases analyzed in the original assessment align with both the expected and actual outputs, demonstrating that the function performs correctly across different scenarios, including edge cases. The reasoning provided clearly articulates how the function handles standard inputs, as well as potential edge cases involving large values and empty lists.

Overall, the annotations support that the implementation adheres to Python's slicing behavior, and the conclusions drawn in the original assessment are consistent and valid. Thus, the final verdict on the program's correctness stands as `True`.
