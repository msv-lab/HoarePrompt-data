You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we can analyze the function `func_1`. 

The function is designed to take a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it splits the list into two parts:
1. The first part contains the first `L` elements of the list.
2. The second part contains the rest of the elements.

Here are the important considerations:
- If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` will return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list.
- If `L` is zero, the first part will be empty, and the second part will be the entire list.
- If `L` is negative, Python's slicing will not function as expected, since it would create an invalid part of the list (the first part would be empty, and the second part would also be invalid).

Now, I will analyze specific cases to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case 1**: List with elements: `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `L = 2`.
   - Expected output: `([1, 2], [3, 4])`
   - Actual output: `([1, 2], [3, 4])` (correct)

2. **Case 2**: List with elements: `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `L = 4`.
   - Expected output: `([1, 2, 3, 4], [])`
   - Actual output: `([1, 2, 3, 4], [])` (correct)

3. **Case 3**: List with elements: `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `L = 0`.
   - Expected output: `([], [1, 2, 3, 4])`
   - Actual output: `([], [1, 2, 3, 4])` (correct)

4. **Case 4**: List with elements: `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `L = 5` (greater than the list length).
   - Expected output: `([1, 2, 3, 4], [])`
   - Actual output: `([1, 2, 3, 4], [])` (correct)

5. **Case 5**: List is empty: `lst = []`, `L = 0`.
   - Expected output: `([], [])`
   - Actual output: `([], [])` (correct)

6. **Case 6**: List is empty: `lst = []`, `L = 1`.
   - Expected output: `([], [])` (still expects the output to return two empty lists)
   - Actual output: `([], [])` (correct)

7. **Case 7**: List with elements: `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, `L = -1` (negative index).
   - Expected output: `([], [1, 2, 3])` (Python slicing still works as per the inherent behavior)
   - Actual output: `([], [1, 2, 3])` (correct)

After going through various edge cases and scenarios, all expected behaviors match the actual outputs produced by the function.

Correctness: **True** 

Explanation: The function correctly splits a list based on the given integer `L`, handling normal cases, edge cases, and even unusual inputs (like negative values and overly large `L` values) as expected according to the Python list slicing behavior.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns two slices of the list: the first slice is the elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (exclusive), and the second slice comprises the elements from index `L` to the end of the list. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is 0 (resulting in the first slice being empty) and where `L` equals the length of `lst` (resulting in the second slice being empty). The function does not perform any input validation beyond ensuring that `L` is within the specified bounds.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
