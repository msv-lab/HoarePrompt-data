Final: **True** 

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately splits a list based on the given integer `L` and handles various cases, including edge scenarios. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function adheres to the conditions and correctly returns two slices of the list without any input validation beyond what is specified in the problem description. The assumptions about valid input being provided (where `L` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= L <= len(lst)`) are also clearly stated in the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment regarding the correctness of the program remains accurate, supporting the conclusion that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
