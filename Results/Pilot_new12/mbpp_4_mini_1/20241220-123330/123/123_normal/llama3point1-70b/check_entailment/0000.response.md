Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function that takes in a list and an integer `L`, splits the list into two parts based on the value of `L`, and returns the two parts as a tuple. The slicing used in `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` operates correctly according to Python's list slicing rules.

Here are some cases considered:

1. If `L` is less than 0, the function will return two parts: the first part will be an empty list, and the second part will be the entire original list, which is a valid behavior in Python list slicing.
2. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part will take the entire list, and the second part will be an empty list, which is also acceptable behavior.
3. If `L` equals the length of the list, it will return the original list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.

In all these scenarios, the function behaves correctly according to the description, hence it is deemed correct.
