Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to split the given list into two parts based on the integer L. It returns a tuple where the first element is the slice of the list from the start up to index L (exclusive), and the second element is the slice from index L to the end of the list. 

According to the output hints, the function handles the two edge cases properly: when L is 0, the first part of the tuple is an empty list, and when L equals the length of the list, the second part of the tuple is an empty list. 

Therefore, the program meets the problem description for every potential case given the assumption that input will be valid, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is correct.
