Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code appears correct and adheres to the specified problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, correctly slices the list into two parts: the first slice contains elements from the start up to index `L` (exclusive), and the second slice contains elements from index `L` to the end of the list. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases where `L` is 0 (resulting in an empty first part) and when `L` equals the length of the list (resulting in an empty second part). All descriptions and edge cases align with the functionality of the code. Therefore, it works correctly for all valid inputs as described.
