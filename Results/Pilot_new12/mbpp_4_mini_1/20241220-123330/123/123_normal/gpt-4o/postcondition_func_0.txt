The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, which must be within the range of the list's length. It returns a tuple consisting of two elements: the first element is a sublist containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second element is a sublist containing the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. In edge cases, if `L` is 0, the first element of the returned tuple will be an empty list, and the second element will contain all elements of `lst`. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first element will contain all elements of `lst` and the second element will be an empty list. The function does not handle any exceptions related to invalid input types for `lst` or `L`.
