Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. According to the problem description and output hints, the function is expected to return the first `L` elements in the first part of the tuple and the rest in the second part, but if `L` exceeds the length of `lst`, it will result in an incorrect output since slicing beyond the length of the list is not handled properly.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the function returns:
```
([1, 2, 3], [])
```
This is not a valid split based on the description, as there should be a mechanism to indicate that `L` is out of bounds. Since the code does not address this situation, it fails to meet the requirements for all potential valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness is deemed false.
