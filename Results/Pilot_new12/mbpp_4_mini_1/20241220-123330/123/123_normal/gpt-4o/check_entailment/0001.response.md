Correctness: **False**

The given function `func_1` does not account for cases where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. In such cases, the slicing `lst[:L]` will still return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list. 

For example:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 5) == ([1, 2, 3], [])
```
This input does not satisfy the problem requirement of splitting the list into two parts of specified length `L` since `L` exceeds the length of the list.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not work as expected.
