The provided program and output hints indicate that the function `func_1` is supposed to split a given list into two parts based on an integer `L`. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Correct Splitting Logic**: The specified code performs list slicing correctly:
   - The first part is obtained with `lst[:L]`, which returns the first `L` elements.
   - The second part is obtained with `lst[L:]`, which returns elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `L` is `0`, the first output list will be empty, and the second will contain all elements, as expected.
   - If `L` equals the length of the list, the first output list will contain all elements, and the second will be empty.

3. **Output Hints Agreement**: 
   - The output hints detail that the function does not explicitly handle exceptions related to invalid input types for `lst` or `L`, but as per the assumption, valid inputs are provided.

### Conclusion:
All test cases and edge situations as described in the problem statement appear to be handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
