Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle cases where the integer L exceeds the length of the input list. For example, consider the following case:

```python
func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)
```

In this case, the length of the list is 3, which is less than L (5). The expected output should be `([], [1, 2, 3])`, but the program will return the same input list and an empty list, giving `([1, 2, 3], [])`. Thus, it doesn't meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
