The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to the handling of cases where the integer L exceeds the length of the input list. The assessment provides an example where calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would yield `([1, 2, 3], [])`, while the expected output should be `([], [1, 2, 3])`. 

Given the problem description, the function `func_1` is supposed to split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of L, and the second part should contain the remainder of the list. However, the function does not account for scenarios where L exceeds the list's length, which is a situation that the original assessment correctly identified as a defect. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.

Moreover, the output hints do suggest that the function must return empty lists when L is greater than the length of the list, indicating that the original assessment is justified and correct.

Final: **False**
