Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements set out in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. It uses slicing to split the list `lst` into two parts:
   - `lst[:L]` returns the first `L` elements of the list.
   - `lst[L:]` returns the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.
3. The two resulting lists are returned as a tuple, which is exactly what the problem description specifies.
4. The assertions provided in the annotated program validate that the function behaves as expected for multiple test cases.

The program assumes valid input as outlined in the problem description (non-negative integer `L` within the bounds of the list), and according to the description, this assumption means the function will not produce errors and will function correctly. Thus, all essential requirements of the problem description are met, confirming the correctness of the program.
