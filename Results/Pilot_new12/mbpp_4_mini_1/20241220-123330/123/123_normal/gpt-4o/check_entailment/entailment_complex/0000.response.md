Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, which matches the parameters specified in the problem description.

2. **Sublist Creation**: The function creates two sublists:
   - The first element of the returned tuple, `lst[:L]`, contains the first `L` elements of the list. If `L` is 0, this will correctly return an empty list as the first part.
   - The second element of the returned tuple, `lst[L:]`, contains all elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, it will correctly return an empty list as the second part.

3. **Tuple Return**: The function correctly returns the two parts as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to return the resulting lists in a tuple.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases adequately:
   - If `L` is 0, it returns `([], lst)` which matches the expected outcome.
   - If `L` equals the length of `lst`, it returns `(lst, [])`, again matching what is described.

5. **Assumed Valid Input**: Given that we assume valid input, the function will behave correctly for all valid cases as described. The lack of error handling for invalid inputs does not detract from the correctness relative to the problem statement.

Therefore, the function `func_1` fulfills all requirements of the problem description, and thus the correctness of the program is validated as true.
