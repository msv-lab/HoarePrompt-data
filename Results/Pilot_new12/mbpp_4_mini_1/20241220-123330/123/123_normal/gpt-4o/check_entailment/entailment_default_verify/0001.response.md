The original assessment states that the correctness of the function `func_1` is **False** because it does not handle cases where the provided integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. This claim is supported by the example provided, where the function does not produce the expected splits when `L` exceeds the size of the list.

Upon reviewing the problem description and the output hints, it is clear that the program indeed does not properly account for when the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list. This misalignment with the problem requirements indicates that the function can produce incorrect behavior for valid inputs (in this case, when `L` exceeds the length of the list).

The output hints further affirm the expectation that `L` should be within the range of the list's length and confirm that if `L` is greater than the list's length, the behavior of the function will not fulfill the problem description as intended. Specifically, the output hints state various edge cases, including when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of `lst`, but do not provide an acceptable behavior when `L` exceeds the list length. 

Therefore, based on the consistent evidence from the original assessment, the problem description, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
