The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list that can contain elements of any type, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ L ≤ len(lst). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return a tuple of the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list.**
