The function accepts a single parameter `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string comprising lowercase letters and underscores. It splits this string into individual words using underscores as delimiters, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then concatenates these words into a single camel case string (with no underscores). The function returns this camel case string. However, it does not handle cases where `snake_case_str` is empty or contains leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores, which could lead to unexpected results in terms of the output format.
