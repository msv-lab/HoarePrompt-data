Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` accurately converts a snake_case string to camelCase according to the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Splitting the String**: The function uses the `split()` method to divide the input string (`snake_case_str`) into a list of words based on underscores. This is the correct method for transforming a snake_case format.

2. **Capitalization of Words**: The function then applies `capitalize()` to each word in the list, which converts the first character of each word to uppercase (while the rest remain lowercase). This is a necessary step in converting to camelCase.

3. **Joining the Words**: Finally, the function uses `join()` to concatenate the capitalized words into a single string without any spaces or underscores. This results in a camelCase format as required.

4. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns the camelCase string.

Since the function fulfills all aspects of the problem description without any errors (given the valid input assumption), it is deemed correct.
