Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases such as an empty string, leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores. For example:

1. Input: `""` (empty string) should return an empty string but the current implementation does not handle this case and may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Input: `"__test__case"` should return `"TestCase"` but the current implementation would incorrectly handle the leading and trailing underscores.
3. Input: `"test__case"` should also yield `"TestCase"` but could return "TestCase" with extra empty words in between due to the consecutive underscores.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not conform to the problem description for all potential cases.
