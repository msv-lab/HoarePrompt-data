Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly convert a snake_case string to a camelCase string. Specifically, it does not handle cases where the initial word should start with a lowercase letter in camelCase format.

For example, consider the input `"hello_world"`. The correct camel case output should be `"helloWorld"`, but the program will output `"HelloWorld"`, starting with an uppercase letter for the first word. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of converting snake case to camel case correctly in all scenarios.
