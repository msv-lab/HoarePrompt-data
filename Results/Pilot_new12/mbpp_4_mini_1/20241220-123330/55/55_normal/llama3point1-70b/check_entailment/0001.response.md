To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the task of converting a snake_case string to a camelCase string.

The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

1. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The input string `snake_case_str` is split at each underscore `_`, resulting in a list of words.
   - Each word in this list is then capitalized, and the capitalized words are concatenated together to form the resulting string.

2. **Expected Camel Case Behavior**:
   - In camelCase, the first letter of the first word should remain lowercase, while the first letter of each subsequent word should be capitalized. For example, `snake_case_example` should become `snakeCaseExample`.
   - The provided code uses `capitalize()`, which will capitalize the first letter of every word, including the first word when it shouldn't.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Input: `snake_case_string`
   - Expected Output: `snakeCaseString`
   - Actual Output of the Program: `SnakeCaseString`

This shows that the program will not produce the correct output for this example, where the first word should remain in lowercase.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly implement the transformation from snake_case to camelCase, as demonstrated by the counterexample provided.
