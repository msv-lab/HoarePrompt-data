You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the task of converting a snake_case string to a camelCase string.

The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

1. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The input string `snake_case_str` is split at each underscore `_`, resulting in a list of words.
   - Each word in this list is then capitalized, and the capitalized words are concatenated together to form the resulting string.

2. **Expected Camel Case Behavior**:
   - In camelCase, the first letter of the first word should remain lowercase, while the first letter of each subsequent word should be capitalized. For example, `snake_case_example` should become `snakeCaseExample`.
   - The provided code uses `capitalize()`, which will capitalize the first letter of every word, including the first word when it shouldn't.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Input: `snake_case_string`
   - Expected Output: `snakeCaseString`
   - Actual Output of the Program: `SnakeCaseString`

This shows that the program will not produce the correct output for this example, where the first word should remain in lowercase.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly implement the transformation from snake_case to camelCase, as demonstrated by the counterexample provided.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string comprising lowercase letters and underscores. It splits this string into individual words using underscores as delimiters, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then concatenates these words into a single camel case string (with no underscores). The function returns this camel case string. However, it does not handle cases where `snake_case_str` is empty or contains leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores, which could lead to unexpected results in terms of the output format.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
