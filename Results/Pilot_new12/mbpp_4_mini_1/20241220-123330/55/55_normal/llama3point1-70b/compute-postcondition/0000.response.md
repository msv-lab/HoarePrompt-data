The code `words = snake_case_str.split('_')` is executed, which takes the string `snake_case_str` and splits it into a list of words wherever there is an underscore. The specifics of the impact depend on the contents of `snake_case_str`. 

Since `snake_case_str` is a string of lowercase letters and underscores, the `split` method will produce a list of substrings (words) that are formed by splitting at each underscore. Therefore, the variable `words` will now hold this list of words.

The previous variable states remain unchanged except for `words`, which now contains the list of split words.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at underscores.**
