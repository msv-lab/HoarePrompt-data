The variable `camel_case_str` is assigned the value generated by joining the words obtained from `snake_case_str`, with each word capitalized. The original `snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, and `words` is derived from splitting this string, resulting in a list of lowercase words. After the code execution, the `camel_case_str` will be in camel case format, where the first letter of each word (except the first one) is capitalized and all underscores are removed. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at underscores; `camel_case_str` is a string in camel case format created from `snake_case_str`.**
