Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the conversion from snake case to camel case as required by the problem description. While it does capitalize the components derived from the split operation, it fails to appropriately handle the first component of the snake case string.

In the camel case format, the first letter of the resulting string should be lowercase, while the first letters of subsequent components should be uppercase. For example, the input `'python_program'` should result in `'pythonProgram'`, but the function currently returns `'PythonProgram'`, which starts with an uppercase letter.

Thus, the function does not satisfy the problem description that states the necessity of converting a snake case string to a properly formatted camel case string. Therefore, it is incorrect.
