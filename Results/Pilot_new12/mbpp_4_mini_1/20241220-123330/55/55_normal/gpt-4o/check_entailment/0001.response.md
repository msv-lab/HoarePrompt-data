Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly convert snake case strings to camel case for edge cases, such as when the input string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. 

For example:
- If the input is `'_leading_underscore'`, the expected output should be `'LeadingUnderscore'`, but the program will produce `'LeadingUnderscore'` without handling the leading underscore properly.
- If the input is `'multiple___underscores'`, the expected output is `'MultipleUnderscores'`, but the program fails to handle the extra underscores; it would result in `'MultipleUnderscores'` treating the empty strings between underscores.

Additionally, the case where the input string is empty (`''`) is also not handled; it should return an empty string, but the code does not have a case for that. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases, demonstrating that it is incorrect.
