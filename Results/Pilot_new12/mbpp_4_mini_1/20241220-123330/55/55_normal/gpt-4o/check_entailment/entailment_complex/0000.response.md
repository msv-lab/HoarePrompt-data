Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks to convert a snake case string to a camel case string. However, the implementation does not account for the following cases:

1. **Leading or Trailing Underscores**: If the input string has leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `'_python'` or `'python_'`), the function will produce unexpected results. The leading underscore would result in an empty component, and the capitalization logic would not be correct.

2. **Consecutive Underscores**: If the input string contains consecutive underscores (e.g., `'python__program'`), the function would create empty components and erroneously capitalize those empty strings, resulting in unwanted capital letters in the output.

3. **All Lowercase Components**: The problem description implies that the final output should be a proper camel case where the first word is capitalized. However, if the snake case string started with an underscore, it would lead to an entirely incorrect capitalization scheme.

Thus, while the function works correctly for well-formed inputs, it fails to correctly handle edge cases involving underscores, leading to problems in correctly converting all valid snake case strings according to the given rules. Hence, the overall implementation does not satisfy the problem description.
