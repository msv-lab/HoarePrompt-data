Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the snake case string starts with an underscore or contains multiple consecutive underscores. For example:

- For the input `'_python_program'`, the expected output should be `PythonProgram`, but the function will return `PythonProgram`, which is correct, but this highlights that it starts correctly but can potentially lead to confusion when there are multiple underscores.
- For the input `'python__program'`, the expected output should be `PythonProgram`, but the function will return `PythonProgram` as it removes only one underscore and will capitalize incorrectly based on usage.

Overall, though the primary examples seem to work well, the edge cases with leading or consecutive underscores reveal that the function does not entirely fit the requirements, leading to incorrect handling in some scenarios. Thus, I would assert that correctness is not maintained across all potential cases.
