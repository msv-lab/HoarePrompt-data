#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string consisting of lowercase letters separated by underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string formed by capitalizing each component derived from the split operation on 'snake_str', which consists of lowercase letters separated by underscores
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `snake_str`, which should consist of lowercase letters separated by underscores. It splits this string into components at the underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each component, and then joins these capitalized components back together into a single string without spaces or underscores. The function returns this resulting string. Potential edge cases include an empty input string, which would result in an empty output string, and strings without underscores that would simply convert the entire string to its capitalized form. Additionally, the function does not handle strings that contain leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive underscores explicitly, which may lead to unexpected capitalizations or empty components in such cases.
