The variable `components` is assigned the value of `snake_str.split('_')`, which splits the string at each underscore and returns a list of components. The original value of `snake_str` remains unchanged but can be transformed into a list called `components`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged `snake_str` and the new `components`.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters separated by underscores, `components` is a list of the components derived from the split operation on `snake_str`.**
