The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the tuple `t`, resulting in a tuple of length N. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` of numbers and return a tuple of the products of each pair of consecutive elements in `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, a tuple of numbers of length N+1, returning a tuple of products of each pair of consecutive elements in t with length N.**
