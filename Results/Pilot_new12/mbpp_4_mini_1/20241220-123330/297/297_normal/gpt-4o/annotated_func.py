#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in the tuple 't', with length N.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` of length `N+1`, where `N` is a non-negative integer, and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in `t`. If `t` has a length of 1 or less (i.e., empty tuple or a single element), the function will return an empty tuple because there are no pairs of consecutive elements to multiply. The final output will be a tuple of length `N`, containing the calculated products.
