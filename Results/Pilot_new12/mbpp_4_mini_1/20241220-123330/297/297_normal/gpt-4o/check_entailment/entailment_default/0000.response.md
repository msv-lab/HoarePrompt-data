The provided program `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of length `N + 1` and returns a tuple of length `N` where each element is the product of each pair of consecutive elements in `t`. The program includes a check that returns an empty tuple if the length of `t` is 1 or less.

Looking at the implementation, we can break down the function:

1. For a tuple with only one element (e.g., `(12,)`), the function correctly returns an empty tuple since there are no pairs to multiply.
2. For longer tuples (greater than 1 element), the function iterates through the elements of the tuple and multiplies each element by its next neighbor, which correctly aligns with the problem description.

The output hints confirm the intended functionality of the code. They state that the function returns a tuple of products of each pair of consecutive elements in `t` and specifies that if `t` has a length of 1 or less, it should return an empty tuple.

I cannot find any examples or edge cases where the program would produce incorrect results according to the problem description. The function and the hints are consistent and provide an expected outcome for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**.
