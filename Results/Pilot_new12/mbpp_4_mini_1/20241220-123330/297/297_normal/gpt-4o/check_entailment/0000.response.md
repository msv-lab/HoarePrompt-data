Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle cases where the input tuple has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length N, where N is one less than the number of elements in the input tuple. 

The assertion `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` indicates that the implementation is expected to handle a single-element tuple correctly, returning an empty tuple. However, the program does not explicitly handle this case before executing the multiplication logic. 

If we provide an input like `func_1((1,))`, it will lead to an IndexError because the loop will attempt to access `t[i + 1]` when `i` is the last index. Thus, the program fails to meet the specifications of the problem for this edge case.
