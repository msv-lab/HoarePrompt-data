Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements defined in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input and Length**: The function assumes that it will receive a tuple `t` of length `N+1`, where `N` is a non-negative integer. This case is explicitly validated in the assertions provided before the function definition.

2. **Output Specification**: The problem description requires that the function returns a tuple of length `N`, where each element is the product of consecutive elements in the input tuple. The function achieves this by iterating over the indices of the input tuple up to the second-to-last index and multiplying each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where the length of `t` is 1 or less by returning an empty tuple. This is consistent with the description that states there will be no pairs of consecutive elements to multiply, thus yielding an empty result.

4. **Validation Through Assertions**: The assertions validate that the function produces the expected output for given input cases, which confirms that it reliably provides the correct output as stated in the problem description.

Overall, the function behaves as required by the problem description for all valid input scenarios, ensuring that the program is correct.
