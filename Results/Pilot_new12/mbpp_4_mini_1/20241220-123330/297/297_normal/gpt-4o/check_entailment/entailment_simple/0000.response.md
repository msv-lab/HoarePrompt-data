Correctness: **True**

The program implements the requirements specified in the problem description correctly. 

**Explanation:**
- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of length \(N + 1\) (where \(N\) is a non-negative integer).
- The function computes the product of each element in the tuple with the next one (`t[i] * t[i + 1]`) using a generator expression, iterating over the indices from `0` to `len(t) - 2` (which corresponds to `N` iterations, since for `t` with length \(N + 1\), there are \(N\) pairs to multiply).
- Finally, it returns the results as a tuple.

The program passes the provided assertions, confirming that the output is as expected:
1. For input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, it returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which corresponds to `1*5`, `5*7`, `7*8`, and `8*10`.
2. For input `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)`, it returns `(8, 20, 30, 42)`, which corresponds to `2*4`, `4*5`, `5*6`, and `6*7`.
3. For input `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)`, it returns `(156, 182, 126, 135)`, which corresponds to `12*13`, `13*14`, `14*9`, and `9*15`.
4. For input `(12,)`, since it contains only one element, it returns an empty tuple `()`, which is correct as there are no pairs to multiply.

Thus, the function meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
