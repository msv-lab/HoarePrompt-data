Final: **False**

The original assessment is correct. The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input tuple has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length N, where N is one less than the number of elements in the input tuple. 

While the program returns an empty tuple for a single-element tuple (as indicated by the assertion `assert func_1((12,)) == ()`), it does so without any prior checks to handle the case of tuples with fewer than two elements. If someone were to call `func_1((1,))`, it would lead to an IndexError when trying to access `t[i + 1]`, because there would not be a second element available for multiplication. Therefore, although the final behavior for this specific case appears correct, it does not adequately handle errors or invalid input cases as expected per the problem description. Thus, the assertion in the original assessment regarding correctness stands valid.
