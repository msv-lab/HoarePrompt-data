The function accepts a tuple `t` of length `N+1`, where `N` is a non-negative integer, and returns a tuple containing the products of each pair of consecutive elements in `t`. If `t` has a length of 1 or less (i.e., empty tuple or a single element), the function will return an empty tuple because there are no pairs of consecutive elements to multiply. The final output will be a tuple of length `N`, containing the calculated products.
