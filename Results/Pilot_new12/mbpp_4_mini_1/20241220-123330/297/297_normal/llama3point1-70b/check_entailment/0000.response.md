Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple. 

Hereâ€™s how the code works:
1. It uses the `zip` function to pair each element of the input tuple with its subsequent element.
2. It then computes the product of each pair using a generator expression.
3. Finally, it converts the generator to a tuple and returns it.

This matches the requirement that the i-th element of the returned tuple should be equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. 

For example:
- For the input `(1, 2, 3)`, the output would be `(1*2, 2*3)` which results in `(2, 6)`.
- For the input `(4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output would be `(4*5, 5*6, 6*7)` resulting in `(20, 30, 42)`.

All edge cases (e.g., tuples of length 2 and larger) have been handled correctly, with the function producing the expected output in each scenario. For an input of a single number or an empty tuple, the code behavior is valid (returning an empty tuple). Thus, the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
