Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition and Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument called `numbers`, which is specified to be a tuple of at least two numbers. This aligns with the problem's input requirement.

2. **Multiplying Adjacent Elements**: The main operation in the function uses the `zip` function to pair each element of the `numbers` tuple with its subsequent element (`numbers[1:]`). Each pair (a, b) represents two adjacent elements from the tuple. The operation within the generator expression computes the product of each pair, effectively implementing the requirement to return the i-th element of the new tuple as the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`.

3. **Returning a Tuple**: The resulting products are collected into a new tuple via `tuple()`, which matches the requirement to return a tuple of length N (where N is the length of the original tuple minus one).

4. **Output Length**: Since the function returns products of adjacent pairs, and given that the input tuple has at least 2 elements, the output will always have length N that is equal to the original length of the input tuple minus 1, thus correctly adhering to the problem description.

Therefore, the program fulfills the conditions outlined in the problem description and handles valid input appropriately, producing the expected output of a tuple containing the products of adjacent numbers.
