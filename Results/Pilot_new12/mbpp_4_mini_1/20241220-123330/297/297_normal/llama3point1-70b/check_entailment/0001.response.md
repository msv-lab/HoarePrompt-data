Correctness: **True**

The program takes a tuple of numbers as input and constructs a new tuple using the product of each element with its successive element. The implementation uses the `zip` function to combine the original tuple with itself, offset by one position. This correctly calculates the products as described.

To verify correctness, we can consider multiple cases:

1. Input: `(2, 3, 4)`, Output: `(6, 12)` which is `2*3` and `3*4`.
2. Input: `(1, 5, 10)`, Output: `(5, 50)` which is `1*5` and `5*10`.
3. Edge case: Input with a single element like `(5,)`, Output: `()` as there are no pairs to compute, which matches the requirement of returning a tuple of length `N` where `N` is length of input tuple minus 1.
4. Input: `(0, 1, 2)`, Output: `(0, 2)` which correctly reflects the product of `0*1` and `1*2`.

The code handles tuples of varying lengths correctly, including those with one element or more. Therefore, the code is correct and meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description without missing logic or edge cases.

Thus, the conclusion is that the code fulfills the problem requirements correctly.
