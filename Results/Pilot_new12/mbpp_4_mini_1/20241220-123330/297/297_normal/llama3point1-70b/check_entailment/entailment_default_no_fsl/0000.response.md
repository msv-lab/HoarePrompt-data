Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input tuple has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the function should take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple that contains the products of each pair of adjacent numbers. However, if the input tuple has only one element or is empty, the current implementation does not return a value, leading to potential runtime errors. 

For instance, if the function is called with an input of (5,) (a single element tuple) or an empty tuple (), the output will be incorrect, as there are no adjacent pairs to multiply. Thus, the program fails to satisfy the conditions stated in the problem description for every potential case.
