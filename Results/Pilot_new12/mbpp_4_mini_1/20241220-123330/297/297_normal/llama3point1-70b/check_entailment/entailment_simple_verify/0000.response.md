Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's correctness. The provided function `func_1` correctly adheres to the problem description by taking a tuple of numbers and returning another tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple.

The annotations also support the correctness of the implementation, confirming that the input tuple is assumed to be of at least two numbers. The use of `zip` in combination with the generator expression effectively pairs each element with its subsequent element, which corresponds exactly to the requirement that the i-th element of the returned tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

Additionally, the example outputs given in the original assessment confirm the correctness of the function for the specified inputs, aligning with the expectations set out in the problem description.

Therefore, given that all aspects of the assessment hold true based on both the reasoning provided and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.
