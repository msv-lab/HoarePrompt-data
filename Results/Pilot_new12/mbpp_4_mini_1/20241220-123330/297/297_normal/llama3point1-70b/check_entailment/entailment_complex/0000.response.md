Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(numbers)` accepts a tuple `numbers` that contains at least two numeric values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent numbers in the input tuple.

Here's why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Requirement**: The function expects a tuple of numbers (which matches the problem description) and correctly assumes that the input is valid and contains at least two numbers.

2. **Output Requirement**: The program returns a tuple of length N (where N is the length of the input tuple minus one) that contains the products of adjacent elements. The use of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` effectively pairs each element in the tuple with its successor, allowing for the calculation of the product `a * b` for each pair. 

3. **Correct Calculation**: It calculates the products accurately, resulting in the expected output as specified in the problem description. For example, given the input tuple `(2, 3, 4)`, the output will indeed be `(6, 12)` since `2*3=6` and `3*4=12`.

4. **Edge Cases**: Although the function doesn't explicitly handle edge cases such as less than two elements or non-numeric types, the problem description specifies that the input will always be valid. Therefore, it is assumed the function will not encounter these erroneous situations.

In conclusion, the function `func_1` consistently implements the logic required by the problem statement and generates the correct output, fulfilling all the necessary conditions.
