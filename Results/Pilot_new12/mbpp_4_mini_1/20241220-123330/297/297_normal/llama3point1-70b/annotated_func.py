#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of at least two numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent numbers in the tuple 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple called 'numbers' containing at least two numeric values. It returns a new tuple consisting of the products of each pair of adjacent numbers in the input tuple. For example, with an input of (2, 3, 4), the output would be (6, 12), where 2*3=6 and 3*4=12. If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, the function would not execute correctly as it relies on adjacent pairs, highlighting a potential edge case where the functionâ€™s expectations about input size are not met. Additionally, if the numbers contain non-numeric types or if they are not valid for multiplication, this could lead to runtime errors that are not handled within the function.
