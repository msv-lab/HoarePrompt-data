#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared to one another.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than 0.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' which is sorted in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts it in ascending order using a selection sort-like approach with a reversal operation. After completing its execution, it returns the sorted list `arr`. The function does not handle the case where `arr` is empty or contains only one element, as the code assumes that `n` (the length of `arr`) is greater than 0 at the start. If the input list is empty, a runtime error would occur due to the `max` function failing to operate on an empty slice.
