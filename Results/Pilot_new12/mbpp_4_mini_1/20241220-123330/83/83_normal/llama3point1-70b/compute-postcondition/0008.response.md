Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the sublist from index 0 to `max_index` is reversed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
