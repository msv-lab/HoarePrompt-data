`arr[:size]` is assigned the reversed list of the first `size` elements of `arr`. The previous state indicates that `max_index` is not equal to 0, so the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are affected by the reversal of the first `size` elements. The length of `arr[:size]` is `size`, meaning this operation will reorder those elements without affecting the rest of the list. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with the first `size` elements reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n - 2`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:size]`, and `max_index` is not equal to 0.**
