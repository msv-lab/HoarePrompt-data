According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `size`. The loop runs as long as `size` is greater than 0, decrementing `size` by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, we know `size` is `n - 1` (since `n` is greater than 0). This implies that for the next iteration to occur, `size` must be adjusted to `n - 2`.

Therefore, if `n` was greater than 1 at the start of the last iteration and `size` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `size` will be `n - 2` for the next iteration. 

Since `max_index` was used only to determine the reversal of elements, it is not directly altered in this context. However, it can be implied that for the next iteration, `max_index` should logically relate to the new `size`, but specifics would depend on the current state of the array `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` represents the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.**
