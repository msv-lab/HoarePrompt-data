Functionality: **The function takes a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts it in ascending order using a selection sort-like approach with a reversal operation. After completing its execution, it returns the sorted list `arr`. The function does not handle the case where `arr` is empty or contains only one element, as the code assumes that `n` (the length of `arr`) is greater than 0 at the start. If the input list is empty, a runtime error would occur due to the `max` function failing to operate on an empty slice.**
