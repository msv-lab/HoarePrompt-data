The operation `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` effectively reverses the sublist of `arr` from the start up to `max_index`, inclusive. The previous state specifies that `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` and is not equal to 0, indicating that there's an actual segment to reverse in the list `arr`.

After executing the code, the list `arr` will have its elements from the start to `max_index` reversed, but the rest of the list and the values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, we keep `arr` intact but note that the sublist has been reversed. The relevant states of the variables are still valid, but we need to reflect the change made to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with elements from index 0 to max_index reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`, and the current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, and not equal to 0.**
