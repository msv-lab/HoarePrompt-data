The code assigns the variable `max_index` the index of the maximum value in the list `arr` from the start of the list up to the `size` index, which is calculated as `n - 1`. This means that `max_index` will now store the index of the largest value among the first `n - 1` elements of `arr`. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `size`) remain unaffected in their states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.**
