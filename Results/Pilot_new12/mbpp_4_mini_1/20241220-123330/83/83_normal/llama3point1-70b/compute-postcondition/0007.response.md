`arr[:size]` is assigned the reversed version of itself, which affects only the sublist from index 0 to `max_index`. Given that `max_index` is not equal to `0`, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `max_index` are reversed. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements where the sublist from index 0 to `max_index` is reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements where the sublist from index 0 to `max_index` is reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr.**
