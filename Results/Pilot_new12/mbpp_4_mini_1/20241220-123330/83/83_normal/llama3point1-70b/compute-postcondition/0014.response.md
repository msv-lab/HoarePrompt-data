Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` represents the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, then the first `size` elements of `arr` have been reversed.***
