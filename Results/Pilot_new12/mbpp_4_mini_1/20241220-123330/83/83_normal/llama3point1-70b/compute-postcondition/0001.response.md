According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which represents the length of `arr`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0; otherwise, the range will not yield any values. Additionally, at the start of the loop, the variable `size` will start at `n`. 

The conditions that need to be satisfied are:
1. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. The initial value of `size` will be equal to `n` at the beginning of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
