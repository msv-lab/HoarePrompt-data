The code assigns the reversed version of the sublist `arr[:size]` to `arr[:size]`. The original sublist consists of the first `size` elements of `arr`, and after reversal, the elements' order in `arr[:size]` is changed. 

The only variable affected in this case is `arr`. The other variables like `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged. 

Since `size` is defined as `n - 1`, it is greater than or equal to 0 (given that `n` is greater than 0). As such, the operation is valid.

Output State: **`arr` is the same list but with its first `size` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.**
