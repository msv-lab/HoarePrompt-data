According to the code, the condition for the loop to execute again depends on the variable `size`. The loop decrements `size` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to `n`, which is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented to `n - 1`. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `size` is now `n - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to one another, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.**
