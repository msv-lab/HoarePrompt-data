To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of sorting a list of elements, we need to analyze the program in detail.

The function defined, `func_1`, is attempting to implement an algorithm that sorts the list using a method that involves reversing parts of the list. It uses the following key steps:

1. It iterates over a range from the length of the list `arr` down to 1.
2. It identifies the index of the maximum element in the current sublist (`arr[:size]`).
3. If the maximum element is not already in its correct position (the last position of the sublist), it reverses the sublist up to the maximum element's index and then reverses the entire sublist.

While this approach might work for certain lists, there are potential problems and edge cases:

### Potential Issues:

1. **Repeated Elements**: If the list contains repeated elements, `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` will always return the first index of the maximum value. This can lead to incorrect sorting since the order of equal elements may not be preserved.

   For example, consider the input: 
   ```python
   arr = [3, 1, 2, 3]
   ```
   The maximum element in the initial call will be `3` and its first occurrence is at index `0`. This will not result in a sorted list as expected.

2. **Empty List**: The function does not handle the case when the input list is empty. While it doesn't throw an error, it returns an empty list, which is somewhat expected, but the code does not explicitly document or test for this case.

3. **Single Element List**: Similar to the empty list, a single element list should also be explicitly handled or tested. The output will be the same single element, which is correct, but again, the edge case isn't documented.

### Conclusion:

Considering these points, particularly the failure to properly sort lists with repeated elements, we can conclude that the function is not correct for every potential input. 

Correctness: **False**
