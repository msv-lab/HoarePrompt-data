To evaluate the given Python program against the problem description of sorting a list, we will examine the implementation in detail to identify any potential cases where it does not function correctly.

The provided program attempts to sort a list using a series of reverse operations based on finding the maximum elements. However, this implementation can encounter issues under certain conditions.

Here are a couple of examples to point out the flaws:

1. **Case of an already sorted list:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Analyzing the implementation:
     - The function begins trying to find the maximum in the entire list. The maximum is `5`, located at index `4`, and it will reverse the entire list only at the end.
     - The first iteration of the outer loop will not perform any unnecessary reversals since the list is already sorted; thus, it might not sort correctly in all scenarios as it doesn't perform any adjustments if items are already sorted.

2. **Case of duplicate elements:**
   - Input: `[3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 3]`
   - The implementation finds `3` as the maximum and can produce unexpected behavior due to how duplicates are handled. When it tries to find the maximum using `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))`, it will always return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value, which could lead to erroneous reversing operations and thus an incorrectly ordered list.

3. **Empty list:**
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected Output: `[]`
   - The implementation does not handle the empty list case gracefully. Although the outer loop will not run, the expected behavior for an empty input should still be defined clearly.

Based on these potential flaws, particularly regarding the handling of sorted lists, duplicates, and empty inputs, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description for every potential input case.

Correctness: **False**.
