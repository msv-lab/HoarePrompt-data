Upon analyzing the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the annotations, I conclude the following:

The problem requires a function that can sort a list of elements. The function `func_1` attempts to sort the list using a reverse-based algorithm. The original assessment correctly identified several potential issues with this approach:

1. **Handling of Repeated Elements**: As highlighted, the use of `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` will always return the first index of the maximum element found. This leads to problems with the stability of the sort when the input contains repeated maximum values. The example provided (`arr = [3, 1, 2, 3]`) illustrates that the sorted list will not maintain the original order of equivalent elements, violating the fundamental property of sorting.

2. **Special Cases**: While the function handles empty and single-element lists without throwing errors, the lack of explicit handling or documentation in the code could lead to confusion regarding its behavior. However, these cases do not fundamentally alter the effectiveness of sorting.

The annotation claims that after the for loop has been executed, the variable `arr` is a list of elements sorted in ascending order. However, given the concerns raised about handling repeated elements and the overall logic of the sorting mechanism, the program cannot guarantee correct behavior for arbitrary inputs, particularly those involving duplicate values.

Therefore, while the annotated code claims the output is sorted, the original reasoning and assessment remain valid, citing that the function does not sort lists with repeated elements correctly.

Final: **False**
