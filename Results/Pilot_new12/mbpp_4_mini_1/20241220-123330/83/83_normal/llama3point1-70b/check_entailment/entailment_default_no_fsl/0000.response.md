Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. According to the output hints, when `arr` is empty, the `max` function would fail to operate on an empty slice, leading to a runtime error. The problem description requires the function to sort a list of elements but the program does not address the scenario of an empty list or a single element list effectively, as it assumes that the length `n` of `arr` is always greater than 0. Hence, it fails to satisfy the requirements for all potential cases.
