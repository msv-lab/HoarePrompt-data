Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not account for several potential edge cases, which affect its correctness. Specifically, the function fails to handle:

1. **Empty Lists**: The code does not provide any handling or return value for an empty list. The absence of a return for these cases means that it could potentially result in unpredictable behavior or an error when trying to access elements.

2. **Single Element Lists**: While the behavior of the sorting function might still be correct for single-element lists, the function is not specifically designed to handle this scenario or provide a clear output, as it relies on looping.

3. **Global Variable Dependency**: The code's reliance on possessing the global variable `arr` can lead to issues if `arr` is not defined, making the functions incomplete.

Additionally, the `flip` function does not have any checks to ensure that `end` parameter remains within the bounds of the defined list, while `find_max_index` assumes that `arr` is defined globally and has sufficient elements.

Given these points, the function does not fulfill the requirements for every potential case as specified in the description. Hence, I conclude that it is incorrect.
