Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately highlights the primary issue in the program: the fact that the variable `arr` is referenced within the `find_max_index` function without being passed as a parameter. This oversight would indeed lead to a `NameError`, since `arr` would not be defined in the local scope of that function. 

Furthermore, even though the output hints suggest that `find_max_index` can identify the maximum element's index if `arr` were accessible, the program as structured does not allow for proper execution in a standard Python environment where passing parameters correctly is essential. This means that the program, as it currently stands, cannot function correctly to sort a list of elements.

Since the program does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description due to this fundamental error, the assessment of correctness remains valid.
