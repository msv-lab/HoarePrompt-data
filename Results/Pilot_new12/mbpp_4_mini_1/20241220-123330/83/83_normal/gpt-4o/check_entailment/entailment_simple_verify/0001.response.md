The original assessment identified a critical issue within the program related to the undefined variable `arr` in the function `find_max_index`. This is crucial because it indicates that the function would raise a `NameError` when executed, which directly prevents the program from achieving its goal of sorting a list.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that both `func_1` and `find_max_index` rely on `arr`, but it has not been passed as an argument to `find_max_index`. The annotations suggest that this relationship between the functions is problematic; `find_max_index` implies that it should have access to `arr`, which is not the case in its current implementation.

The annotations assert that `func_1` is intended to sort the list but fail to account for the fact that without a proper definition or passing of `arr`, it cannot do so. Therefore, the annotations would not alter the conclusion drawn in the original assessment.

Given this analysis, the conclusion remains unchanged.

Final: **False**
