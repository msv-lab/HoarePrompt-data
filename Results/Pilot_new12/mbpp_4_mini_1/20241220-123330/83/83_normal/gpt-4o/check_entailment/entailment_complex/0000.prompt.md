You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and `curr_size` is 1.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted array 'arr' in ascending order along with its original length 'n' and the current size 'curr_size' which is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order using a specific sorting method that involves finding the maximum element and flipping it to its correct position iteratively. After execution, the function returns the sorted list `arr`. The function does not explicitly return the original length `n` or the current size `curr_size` as stated in the annotations; instead, it only returns the sorted list. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which are not addressed by the provided code. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` is sorted and contains the same elements as the original list, but the original size and current size are not part of the return value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and start is initialized to 0. The function assumes that arr is a pre-defined list that is accessible in its scope.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is the original value of `end`, `arr` has been modified such that the elements from index 0 to index (original value of end) have been swapped with their corresponding elements from the back of the array up to `end`. If the original value of `end` was odd, the middle element remains in its original position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `flip` takes one parameter, `end`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. It modifies a pre-defined list `arr` by swapping the elements from index 0 to index `end` with their corresponding elements from the back of the list up to index `end`. After executing, the function ensures that the elements in `arr` are reflected in reversed order from the front up to the specified `end`. If the original value of `end` is odd, the middle element remains in its original position, effectively reversing the order of the elements without altering the middle one. The function does not return any value; it directly modifies the list `arr`. However, the function assumes that `arr` is defined globally and accessible, which may lead to errors if `arr` does not exist or is not properly defined before calling the function. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `end` is less than the length of the list, which could result in an index out of range error if `end` exceeds the actual size of `arr`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer indicating the length of the list, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, which is at least 0. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `max_index` remains 0. If `n` is greater than 1, after all iterations, `max_index` indicates the index of the largest element in `arr` among the indices from 0 to n-1.
    return max_index
    #The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr' among the indices from 0 to n-1. If n is 1, max_index remains 0, otherwise it indicates the position of the largest element in 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and a globally accessible list `arr` of comparable elements. It iterates through the list to determine the index of the maximum element from index `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is `1`, the function returns `0`, indicating that the only element is the maximum by default. When `n` is greater than `1`, it updates `max_index` whenever a larger element is found during the iteration. However, as the annotated code provided does not mention passing `arr` as a parameter, it is implied that `arr` must be defined in the surrounding scope for the function to work correctly. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the specified range of `arr` but relies on the availability of `arr` in a global context, which is a potential oversight because the function does not handle situations where `arr` might be undefined or empty. Thus, it effectively returns the index of the maximum element based on the defined logic but is incomplete in its functional design regarding parameter handling.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
