Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description of sorting a list of elements correctly. The issues are as follows:

1. **Scope Issue with the `arr` Variable**: The `arr` variable is referenced in the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions without being passed as an argument or being declared as global. This leads to a potential NameError because `arr` is not defined in those functions. 

2. **Sorting Logic Flaw**: The sorting algorithm employed appears to be a version of Pancake Sorting, which involves flipping elements. While this algorithm might indeed sort the list, the logic used to update the `curr_size` and perform flips is not properly implemented. The condition of when to flip parts of the array does not guarantee that all elements are sorted correctly. The algorithm does not ensure that the entire list is processed in a way that maintains the sort order after multiple iterations of flipping.

3. **Lack of Return Value Validation**: The assertions provided for testing will not be executed correctly if the sorting logic fails due to the aforementioned problems, meaning the function may not behave as expected.

Due to these issues, the program does not reliably perform the task of sorting a list in all cases, and thus fails to satisfy the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
