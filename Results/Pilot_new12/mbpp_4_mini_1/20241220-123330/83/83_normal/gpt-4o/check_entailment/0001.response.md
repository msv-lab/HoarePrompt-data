To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description of sorting a list, we need to dissect the code and its functionality.

The problem description states that the goal is to sort a list of elements. The provided program includes three functions: `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index`.

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - It attempts to sort an array using some sort of flip technique.
   - For each iteration from the size of the array down to 2, it finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array using `find_max_index`.
   - If that maximum is not the last element in the unsorted portion, it flips the maximum to the front and then flips it again to put it in the correct place at the end of the sorted portion.

2. **Functionality of `find_max_index`**:
   - This function attempts to find the index of the maximum value in the given range of the array, but it relies on a variable `arr` which is not defined within its scope, and hence it will raise a `NameError`.

3. **Functionality of `flip`**:
   - This function swaps elements at the start and end indices until they meet in the middle, effectively reversing the portion of the list up to `end`.

### Issues Identified:
- The variable `arr` in `find_max_index(n)` is not either passed as an argument or defined, which will cause the program to fail when executed.
- Given that the sorting process is dependent on `find_max_index`, and since it is referencing an undefined variable, the whole sorting functionality is compromised.

### Potential test case that will fail:
- Running `func_1([3, 1, 2])` will cause a `NameError` because `arr` is not defined in the context of `find_max_index`.

Given the above analysis, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description since it does not sort the list due to the error.

Correctness: **False**
