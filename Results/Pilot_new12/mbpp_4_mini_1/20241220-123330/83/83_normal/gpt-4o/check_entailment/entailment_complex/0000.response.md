Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle edge cases and potential scenarios as per the problem description. The main issues are:

1. **Assumption of Global Variables**: The functions `flip` and `find_max_index` rely on a global variable `arr`. If `arr` is not defined globally before calling these functions, it will lead to errors, making them incomplete for self-contained use.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The sorting method described in the function `func_1` neglects to handle cases where `arr` could be empty or contain only one element. While the assumption is that valid inputs will be provided, the program does not adequately describe how it will process or return results for these scenarios.

3. **Return Value**: According to the annotations, the function mentions that `arr` is to be returned as sorted along with the original length `n` and the current size `curr_size`, yet it only returns `arr` at the end. This discrepancy in the expected output further suggests that the description used for understanding the program is misleading.

Due to these reasons, the program does not meet the problem description requirements in all potential cases, leading to it being deemed incorrect.
