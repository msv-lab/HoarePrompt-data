Correctness: **False**.

The main issue with the provided program is that the variable `arr` is referenced in `find_max_index` without being passed into it. This will lead to a `NameError` since `arr` is not defined in the local scope of `find_max_index`. 

Moreover, the implementation of the sorting algorithm appears to be an attempt at the pancake sorting algorithm, but since `arr` is not defined or passed to the functions properly, it cannot work as intended. 

For example, if we try to call `func_1([3, 2, 1])`, it will raise an error because `arr` is not accessible in `find_max_index`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements in the problem description to sort a list of elements correctly.
