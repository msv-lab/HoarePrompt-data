According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, which means the loop has executed at least once. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` has been updated to 1; otherwise, it remains 0. 

The loop will execute again for the next value of `i`, which is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2**
