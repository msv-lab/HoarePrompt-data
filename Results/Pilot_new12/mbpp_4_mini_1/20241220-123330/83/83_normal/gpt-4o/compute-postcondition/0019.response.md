The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other. After executing the function body, the function returns the sorted array `arr` in ascending order along with its original length `n` and the current size `curr_size` which is 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the sorted version of this list along with its original length and a fixed current size of 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list arr, returns the sorted list in ascending order, its original length, and a current size of 1.**
