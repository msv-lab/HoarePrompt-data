The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. The previous value of `max_index` could be either 0 or 1, but after executing the code, its value will be set to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 3, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 3, `i` is 3**
