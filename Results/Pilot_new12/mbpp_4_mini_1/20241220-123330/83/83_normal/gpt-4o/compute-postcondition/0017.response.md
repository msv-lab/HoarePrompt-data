Initial State: `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.

The loop performs a series of iterations decrementing `curr_size` from `n` down to 2, likely moving elements into their sorted order through a series of flips based on the maximum index found for the current segment of the list.

Output State after the loop has finished executing: `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and `curr_size` would be 1 after all iterations. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and `curr_size` is 1.**
