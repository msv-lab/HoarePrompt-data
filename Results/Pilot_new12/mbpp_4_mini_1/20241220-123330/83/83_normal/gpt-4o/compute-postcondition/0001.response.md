To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the loop's structure and the initial conditions.

1. The loop starts with `i = 1` and iterates until `i < n`. 
2. Since `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list, we must ensure that `n` is at least 2 in order for the loop to be executed (as `i` starts from 1 and must reach 1 < n).
3. The states `arr` and `max_index` do not influence the loop execution directly at its start; however, `max_index` will typically be used in the loop body.

Therefore, the critical adjustment needed for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is at least 2. At the start, `i` will be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
