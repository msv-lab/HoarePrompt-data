The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `1`. Since `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]` and `max_index` was initially `0`, the condition is satisfied, and now `max_index` takes the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1**
