Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, and `max_index` is either 0 or 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` is updated to 2, indicating that the element at index 2 is currently the largest. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `arr[max_index]`, `max_index` remains unchanged.***
