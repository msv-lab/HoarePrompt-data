To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information.

The loop is defined with `for i in range(1, n):`, which means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. The conditions provided state that `n` is at least 3, which allows for at least two iterations of the loop (when `i` is 1 and 2). 

At the end of the previous iteration, we do not have a specific value for `i` because it hasn't been provided in the input. However, since `i` is updated in the loop based on the number of iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **For the loop to execute one more time**: The current value of `i` must be less than `n - 1`. 
2. **Possible values of `i` at the end of the last iteration**: If `i` was 1 at the beginning of the first iteration, it would be 2 after the first iteration. If `i` was 2 at the beginning of the second iteration, that means it was also allowed to run once more because `n` is at least 3.

Given that the only values for `i` can be 1 or 2, let's analyze:

- If `i` is currently 2, then for the loop to run again, we can safely conclude that `i` increments in the next iteration to 3.
- In this case, `max_index` remains either 0 or 1 based on its condition, and similarly, `max_index` has potentially been updated to 2 only if `arr[i]` was greater than `arr[max_index]` during the last check.

Therefore, to set `i` for the next execution:
- If `i` is currently 2 at the end of the last iteration, it will increment to 3 for the next check.
- The condition for `n` still holds true since it must remain at least 3.

So, we conclude:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, and `max_index` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 3**
