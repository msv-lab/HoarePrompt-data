The variable `max_index` is initialized to 0. There are no calculations or changes to the other variables (`n` and `arr`), as their values remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State clearly indicates the initialization of `max_index`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0**
