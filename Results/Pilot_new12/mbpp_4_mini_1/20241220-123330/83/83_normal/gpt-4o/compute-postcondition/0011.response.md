Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, which is at least 0. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `max_index` remains 0. If `n` is greater than 1, after all iterations, `max_index` indicates the index of the largest element in `arr` among the indices from 0 to n-1.**
