#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and `curr_size` is 1.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted array 'arr' in ascending order along with its original length 'n' and the current size 'curr_size' which is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order using a specific sorting method that involves finding the maximum element and flipping it to its correct position iteratively. After execution, the function returns the sorted list `arr`. The function does not explicitly return the original length `n` or the current size `curr_size` as stated in the annotations; instead, it only returns the sorted list. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which are not addressed by the provided code. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` is sorted and contains the same elements as the original list, but the original size and current size are not part of the return value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and start is initialized to 0. The function assumes that arr is a pre-defined list that is accessible in its scope.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is the original value of `end`, `arr` has been modified such that the elements from index 0 to index (original value of end) have been swapped with their corresponding elements from the back of the array up to `end`. If the original value of `end` was odd, the middle element remains in its original position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `flip` takes one parameter, `end`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. It modifies a pre-defined list `arr` by swapping the elements from index 0 to index `end` with their corresponding elements from the back of the list up to index `end`. After executing, the function ensures that the elements in `arr` are reflected in reversed order from the front up to the specified `end`. If the original value of `end` is odd, the middle element remains in its original position, effectively reversing the order of the elements without altering the middle one. The function does not return any value; it directly modifies the list `arr`. However, the function assumes that `arr` is defined globally and accessible, which may lead to errors if `arr` does not exist or is not properly defined before calling the function. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `end` is less than the length of the list, which could result in an index out of range error if `end` exceeds the actual size of `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer indicating the length of the list, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, which is at least 0. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `max_index` remains 0. If `n` is greater than 1, after all iterations, `max_index` indicates the index of the largest element in `arr` among the indices from 0 to n-1.
    return max_index
    #The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr' among the indices from 0 to n-1. If n is 1, max_index remains 0, otherwise it indicates the position of the largest element in 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and a globally accessible list `arr` of comparable elements. It iterates through the list to determine the index of the maximum element from index `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is `1`, the function returns `0`, indicating that the only element is the maximum by default. When `n` is greater than `1`, it updates `max_index` whenever a larger element is found during the iteration. However, as the annotated code provided does not mention passing `arr` as a parameter, it is implied that `arr` must be defined in the surrounding scope for the function to work correctly. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the specified range of `arr` but relies on the availability of `arr` in a global context, which is a potential oversight because the function does not handle situations where `arr` might be undefined or empty. Thus, it effectively returns the index of the maximum element based on the defined logic but is incomplete in its functional design regarding parameter handling.
