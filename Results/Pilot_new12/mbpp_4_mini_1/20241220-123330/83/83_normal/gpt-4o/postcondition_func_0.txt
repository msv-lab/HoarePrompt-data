The function `func_1` sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order using a specific sorting method that involves finding the maximum element and flipping it to its correct position iteratively. After execution, the function returns the sorted list `arr`. The function does not explicitly return the original length `n` or the current size `curr_size` as stated in the annotations; instead, it only returns the sorted list. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which are not addressed by the provided code. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` is sorted and contains the same elements as the original list, but the original size and current size are not part of the return value.
