Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately concludes that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of flattening a nested list. The annotated version of the code supports this assertion by clearly demonstrating the behavior of the program at various points, confirming that it processes the input as described in the problem statement. 

The annotations specify that the program handles lists and any level of nesting correctly, ensuring that all elements are included in the flattened output while the original list remains unchanged. Each test case shows that the function meets the expected outputs, which reinforces the correctness. Therefore, there is no evidence from the provided annotations or the original assessment to suggest any shortcomings in the program, leading to the conclusion that it meets the problem description as intended.
