Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully flattens a nested list structure as described in the problem statement. The annotated version supports this conclusion by confirming that the function handles nested lists correctly through recursion, appending elements to `flat_list` and preserving order.

The provided test cases validate the function's behavior, and the annotations indicate that `flat_list` contains all elements flattened into a single layer upon completion of the loop. Additionally, the assumption of valid input means we do not have to consider edge cases beyond what was defined. The overall reasoning in the original assessment remains supported by the provided annotations, confirming the function operates as intended.
