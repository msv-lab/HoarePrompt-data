Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description. It successfully flattens a nested list structure of integers or other lists at any depth and returns a new flat list. 

The code includes a recursive mechanism to handle lists contained within any level of nesting:
- It checks each item in the input `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item to flatten it further, and then extends the `flat_list` with the resulting flattened items.
- If the item is not a list (meaning it is an integer or any other non-list object), it is directly appended to `flat_list`.
- The examples provided in the assertions match the expected outputs and show that the function can handle varying structures correctly.

Furthermore, the output hints confirm that the function handles all edge cases mentioned, such as empty lists, and does so without altering the original input. Since the function addresses every potential case considered in the problem description, I determine that its correctness is complete.
