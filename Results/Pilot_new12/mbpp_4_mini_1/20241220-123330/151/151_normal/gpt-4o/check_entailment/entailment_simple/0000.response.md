Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure as described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why this is the case:

1. **Function Definition and Input**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that may contain integers or other nested lists.

2. **Flattening Logic**:
   - The function initializes an empty list called `flat_list` to hold the flattened elements.
   - It iterates through each item in `nested_list`.
   - If an item is a list (checked using `isinstance(item, list)`), the function calls itself recursively on that item, which will eventually handle further levels of nesting. The results are added to `flat_list` using `extend` (to merge lists).
   - If the item is not a list (an integer, in this case), it simply appends it to `flat_list`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - After processing all items in `nested_list`, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements extracted and flattened into a single-layer list.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided assertions test the function with various nested list structures, and in each case, the function's output matches the expected flattened list.

Given these points, the program satisfactorily fulfills the requirement of "flattening a given nested list structure," and thus, it is correct according to the problem description. The program handles potential cases of nested lists to an arbitrary depth effectively, confirming that it adheres to the specified functionality.
