Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to flatten a nested list structure. The program uses a recursive approach that checks each element in the input list. If the element is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that element and extends the flat list with the returned flattened list. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to the flat list. 

To ensure the correctness of `func_1`, consider the following:

1. It properly handles multiple levels of nesting, as it continuously checks each item in the nested lists until all items are extracted.
2. It includes several test cases that cover various scenarios, including multiple nested lists and flat structures, all of which yield the expected outputs.
3. The function operates on an arbitrary number of nested lists, meaning it can correctly flatten deeply nested lists without prior knowledge of the nesting depth.

After evaluating these points, I find that there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, it behaves correctly for all tested scenarios.
