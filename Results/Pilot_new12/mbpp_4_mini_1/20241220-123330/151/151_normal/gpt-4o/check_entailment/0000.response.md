Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements a method to flatten a nested list. It recursively checks if each item in the list is itself a list. If it is, it calls `func_1` again on that item to further flatten it; if it's not a list, it directly appends the item to `flat_list`. 

All provided test cases successfully validate that the function flattens various nested structures into a single flat list, preserving the order of elements. Since there are no identified edge cases or scenarios where the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, it is determined to be correct.
