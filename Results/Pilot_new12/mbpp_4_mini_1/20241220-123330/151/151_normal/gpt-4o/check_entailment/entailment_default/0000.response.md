The provided program `func_1` does indeed aim to flatten a nested list structure as specified in the problem description. The function constructs a new list `flat_list` that appends elements from the input `nested_list`, using recursion to handle any nested lists within it.

The problem description states that `func_1` should return all elements of any integers or non-list objects found in `nested_list`, merged into a single layer. The output hints confirm that `func_1` appropriately flattens any level of nesting as described.

The function has been tested with several assertions that demonstrate it correctly flattens the provided nested lists, producing the expected outcomes.

An important note is that if `nested_list` is empty or contains no elements, the function should return an empty list. This behavior aligns with the description, as it has been tested and appears to hold true.

Since there are no apparent issues or edge cases that cause it to deviate from the problem description for the valid inputs assumed, I find that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
