Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure as per the problem description. It adheres to the expected behavior reflected in the output hints and handles various test cases correctly. Specifically, it maintains the order of elements and flattens any level of nested lists.

The output hints confirm that the function is designed to work with valid input and return a flat list while leaving the original `nested_list` unchanged, which aligns perfectly with the provided test cases. Since there are no identified issues or edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements, the assessment of correctness as **True** remains justified.
