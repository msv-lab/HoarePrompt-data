Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly meets the requirements of the problem description by effectively flattening a nested list structure. The recursive approach used in the function checks each element in the input list, ensuring that it properly handles multiple levels of nesting.

The provided output hints support the correctness by clarifying that the function returns a new list that includes all elements from the `nested_list`, regardless of the depth of nesting. Furthermore, they specify that it correctly returns an empty list when given an empty input, which confirms that the function is robust against variations in the content of the list.

Overall, the reasoning present in the original assessment aligns with the confirmed behavior of the function, providing evidence that it works as intended in all tested scenarios. Thus, the function behaves correctly according to the problem description and the output hints provided.
