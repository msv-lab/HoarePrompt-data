Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Recursion for Nesting**: The function uses recursion to handle any level of nested lists. When the current item in `nested_list` is itself a list, the function calls itself to flatten that sublist, ensuring that all levels of nesting are addressed.

2. **Handling Non-List Elements**: If an item is not a list (i.e., it is assumed to be an integer or other non-list objects), the function simply appends it to the `flat_list`. This guarantees that all integers in the nested structure are included in the final output.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from the original `nested_list` merged into a single layer without altering the original list structure. If the input `nested_list` is empty or contains only empty lists, `flat_list` will also be empty, fulfilling the requirement of returning an empty list when no elements are present.

4. **Consistent Output**: The provided assertions show expected outputs, and they confirm that the function produces the correct flattened list for various input configurations, including those with multiple nested levels.

In summary, since `func_1` effectively flattens any nested list structure into a single list as required by the problem description, the correctness of the program is assured.
