According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` has at least 2 items, if the current `item` is the first item in the list, the next item will be the second item in the list. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` is updated to include elements from `func_1(item)`, and if `item` is not a list, `flat_list` contains its previous elements plus `item`. 

To enable the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items. If we are currently at the first item (index 0), after the next iteration, `item` would take on the value of the second item (index 1) of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, flat_list is updated accordingly, item is the second item in the list.**
