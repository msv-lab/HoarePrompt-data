To analyze the code snippet, we see that `flat_list` is empty and `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, which is also a list. The statement `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` indicates that the method `func_1` is applied to `item`, and the result is added to `flat_list`.

Since the initial state does not specify the output of `func_1(item)`, we can denote it as 'result_of_func_1'.

As a consequence, after executing the code:
- The list `flat_list` will now contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.
- The value of `item` remains unchanged:
- The variable `nested_list` is unaffected as its content does not change.

Therefore, the Output State would reflect the updated `flat_list` and the existing `nested_list` and `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item; `flat_list` contains the elements of `func_1(item)`; `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, which is a list.**
