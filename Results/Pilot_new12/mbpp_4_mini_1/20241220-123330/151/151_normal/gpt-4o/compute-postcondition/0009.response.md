`flat_list` is updated to include `item`, which could either be a single value or the result of `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 2 items, which means `item` is defined and can take a valid value based on the second item in `nested_list`. The state of the other variables is not affected, so the output state includes all relevant preconditions.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` now contains its previous elements plus `item`.**
