According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 items, the loop will execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one item, and `item` is the first item in that list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items (the next item being indexed could either be of type list or not), and `item` will be the second item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list, flat_list contains the elements of `func_1(item)` if item is a list, otherwise flat_list contains item.**
