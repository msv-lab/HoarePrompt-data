The `flat_list` is being updated with the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the second item in `nested_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `nested_list` has at least 3 items, `item` holds the value of the second item in that list. The actual content of `flat_list` is not specified, nor is the output of `func_1(item)`, but we know that `flat_list` will now include whatever `func_1(item)` returns.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `flat_list` is updated to include the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the second item in the list.**
