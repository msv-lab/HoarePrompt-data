The value of `item` is assigned as the second item in `nested_list`. The `flat_list` is updated by appending `item` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, but we now know that `flat_list` includes at least one new item derived from `nested_list`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items; `flat_list` is updated to include `item` which is the second item in `nested_list`.**
