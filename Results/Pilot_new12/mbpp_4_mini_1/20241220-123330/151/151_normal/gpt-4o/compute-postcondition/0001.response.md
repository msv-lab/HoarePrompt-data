According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one item (whether it be an integer or another list), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `flat_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop is concerned with `nested_list`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `nested_list` must have at least one item. At the start of the loop, `item` should be the first item in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
