To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop in the provided code, we have to consider what the loop is doing and how it interacts with the `nested_list` and `flat_list`.

- The loop iterates over `nested_list`. 
- If an item is itself a list, it processes that list with `func_1(item)` and extends `flat_list` with the result. 
- If it’s not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`.

Here’s the detailed output assessment after all iterations of the loop:

1. The loop can only execute if `nested_list` contains at least one item.
2. After all iterations, `flat_list` will contain all the elements from `nested_list`, including any nested lists that are flattened by calling `func_1(item)`.
3. The items appended to `flat_list` will reflect the complete hierarchy of items in `nested_list`, whether they were directly integers or contained within further nested lists that were processed.

Therefore, the complete variable relationships after the loop execution can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all elements from `nested_list` flattened into a single layer, `nested_list` is a list that may still contain nested structures, and if the loop does not execute, `flat_list` remains an empty list.**
