The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or other lists at any depth. It returns a new list, `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from `nested_list` merged into a single layer, effectively flattening any nested structures. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no elements, the function returns an empty list. The function recursively handles any level of nesting, ensuring that all integers and non-list objects are included in the final output. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged throughout the process.
