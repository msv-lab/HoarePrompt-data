Final: **False**

The original assessment claimed that the function correctly flattens a nested list structure and handled all potential cases. However, the annotations point out a significant limitation: the function does not manage cases where the elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`. This could lead to erroneous behavior or output if the input contains unexpected types such as strings, floats, or other non-integer types. 

The specific issue highlighted by the annotations indicates that the program's output may not be as intended for all valid nested structures, particularly those containing mixed types. Therefore, although the function handles typical cases correctly, the lack of robustness in handling various types leads to the conclusion that it does not fulfill the problem description adequately under all circumstances. This discrepancy means the original assessment of correctness does not fully account for this limitation.
