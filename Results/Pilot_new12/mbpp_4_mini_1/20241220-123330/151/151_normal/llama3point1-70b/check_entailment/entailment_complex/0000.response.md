Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to flatten a given nested list structure.

### Explanation:
1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to traverse through the `nested_list`. When an element is found to be a list, it recursively calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that inner list, thus correctly handling nested structures of any depth.

2. **Appending Integers**: For elements that are not lists (which are assumed to be integers, per the description), it appends them directly to the `flat_list`. This ensures that the integers are collected in the flattened version.

3. **Correct Output**: The final output, `flat_list`, consolidates all integers from the original nested list, effectively meeting the requirement of producing a flat structure with only integers.

4. **Input Constraints Assumed**: The program assumes valid input as mentioned in the task description. Since the input is expected to only include integers and lists, any other type of data will be ignored, thus not breaking the functionality.

5. **Absence of Error Handling**: While the program does not handle non-integer types that may appear in the list (such as strings or dictionaries), this does not invalidate its correctness as per the stated assumptions, which only highlight valid use cases.

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and achieves the intended functionality of flattening a nested list structure.
