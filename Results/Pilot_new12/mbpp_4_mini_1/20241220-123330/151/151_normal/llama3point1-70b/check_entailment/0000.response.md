Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element of the input list. If an element is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that element to flatten it, then extends the `flat_list` with the flattened result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`. 

This logic handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty nested list (which returns an empty list).
- A nested list with varying levels of depth.
- A list that contains non-list elements.

Since the function correctly flattens any type of nested list structure and handles all edge cases, the logic is sound, and I could not find any scenarios where it would fail to meet the problem description.
