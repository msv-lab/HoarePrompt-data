Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both. The program assumes valid input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Recursion**: The function uses recursion to handle nested lists. For each element in `nested_list`, it checks if the element (`i`) is itself a list. If `i` is a list, the function calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that nested list further. This ensures that all levels of nested lists are processed correctly.

3. **Appending to Flat List**: If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it directly appends that element to the `flat_list`. The use of `flat_list.extend()` and `flat_list.append()` ensures that the function accumulates all integer elements from various levels of nesting into a single flat list.

4. **Return Value**: After processing all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which now contains all integers from the original nested list structure, maintaining the required output format as specified in the problem description.

In summary, the function faithfully implements a process that yields a completely flattened list regardless of the complexity of the nested list structure, thereby satisfying the problem's requirements.
