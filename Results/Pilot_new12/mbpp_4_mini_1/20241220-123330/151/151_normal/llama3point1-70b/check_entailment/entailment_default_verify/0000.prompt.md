You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element of the input list. If an element is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that element to flatten it, then extends the `flat_list` with the flattened result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`. 

This logic handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty nested list (which returns an empty list).
- A nested list with varying levels of depth.
- A list that contains non-list elements.

Since the function correctly flattens any type of nested list structure and handles all edge cases, the logic is sound, and I could not find any scenarios where it would fail to meet the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure. It processes this list recursively to create a new list, `flat_list`, which contains all integers extracted from the original `nested_list` as well as all integers from any nested lists found within it. The final state of the program after executing the function is that it returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of the input, containing only integers and discarding any list structures. However, it does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`, which could lead to unintended behavior or erroneous output if encountered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
