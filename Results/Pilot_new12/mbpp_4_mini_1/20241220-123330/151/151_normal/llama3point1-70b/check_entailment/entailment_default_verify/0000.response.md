Final: **False**

Although the original assessment claimed the program is correct, the provided output hints reveal a significant oversight. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure containing integers and lists. However, it does not account for elements in `nested_list` that may be of types other than `list` or `int`. This limitation means that if the input list contains elements of unexpected types (such as strings, floats, etc.), the program could yield unintended behavior or erroneous output.

The output hints clearly indicate that the program might fail to handle a mixed-type input properly, contradicting the original assessment that stated it would manage all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness does not hold true upon closer examination of the output hints provided. Thus, the final assessment is that the program is not fully correct as per the problem description.
