You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to each nested list in `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all integers from nested_list and the results of func_1 applied to each nested list in nested_list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure. It processes this list recursively to create a new list, `flat_list`, which contains all integers extracted from the original `nested_list` as well as all integers from any nested lists found within it. The final state of the program after executing the function is that it returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of the input, containing only integers and discarding any list structures. However, it does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`, which could lead to unintended behavior or erroneous output if encountered.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
