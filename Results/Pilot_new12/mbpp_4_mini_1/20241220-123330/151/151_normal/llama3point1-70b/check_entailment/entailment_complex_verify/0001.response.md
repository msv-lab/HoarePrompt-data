Final: **False**

While the program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list of integers and lists, the annotation reveals a significant oversight: the function does not account for elements in `nested_list` that are neither `int` nor `list`. The problem description specifies the need to flatten a nested list structure, but the program implicitly assumes that all elements will be either integers or lists. If any other types (e.g., strings, floats, or user-defined types) are present in `nested_list`, the function will behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

The original assessment stated that the program does not have any edge cases it fails to handle, which is inaccurate given the potential for mixed types in the input list. Therefore, I must conclude that the function does not meet the requirements fully as specified in the problem description.
