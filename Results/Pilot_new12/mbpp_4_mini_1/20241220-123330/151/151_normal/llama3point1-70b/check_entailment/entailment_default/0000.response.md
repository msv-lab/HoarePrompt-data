The program provided correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively traversing the elements of the input list. It checks if an element is a list itself and if so, recursively calls itself to flatten it further. If the element is not a list, it appends it to the `flat_list`. 

However, the output hints indicate that it does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`. For example, if a string or a dictionary is present in `nested_list`, the program will not handle it properly, which could lead to unintended behavior or incorrect output (it would ignore those types, resulting in a loss of data).

This means that while the core functionality of flattening nested lists containing integers is correct, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description thoroughly because it does not account for all possible element types in `nested_list`.

Correctness: **False**.
