Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to flatten a nested list structure by recursively extracting integers from the input list and any nested lists. However, it does not account for elements within the `nested_list` that are neither lists nor integers. According to the output hints, if the input contains elements of other types (e.g., strings, dictionaries, etc.), the program will behave incorrectly by not processing these elements and not discarding them, leading to unintended consequences.

For example:
```python
nested_list = [1, [2, "three"], 4]
output = func_1(nested_list)
# Expected: [1, 2, 4]
# Actual: [1, 2, "three", 4"] -- it includes a string "three", which should not be present.
```

This demonstrates that the program does not successfully filter out non-integer items from the nested structure, thereby violating the requirement specified in the problem description.
