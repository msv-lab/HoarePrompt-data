Final: **False**

The original assessment claimed the program's correctness to be **True**, but the output hints suggest that the function does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`. This could lead to unintended behavior or errors if such elements are present. 

While the program successfully flattens nested lists containing integers (as stated in the problem description), it is not robust against unexpected data types. The original assessment overlooked this crucial point, leading to an inaccurate conclusion. Thus, the program does not fully meet the problem description requirements.
