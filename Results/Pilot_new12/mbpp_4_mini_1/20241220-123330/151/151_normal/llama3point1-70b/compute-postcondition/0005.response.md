The variable `i` is appended to the `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. Therefore, `i` is a valid single element (not a list) that gets added to `flat_list`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` now contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
