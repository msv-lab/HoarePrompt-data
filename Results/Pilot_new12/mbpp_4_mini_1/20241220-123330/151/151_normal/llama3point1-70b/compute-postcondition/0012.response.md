In the given code snippet, `flat_list` is updated by extending it with the result of `func_1(i)`. The value of `i` is defined as the third element in the `nested_list`, which contains at least three elements. Therefore, the function `func_1` will act on this specific value `i`.

The prior states of the variables are still valid except for `flat_list`, which will now contain additional elements based on the output of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is updated to include the result of `func_1(i)`.**
