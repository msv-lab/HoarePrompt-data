The `flat_list` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is the next element in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` holds a specific value from that list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in `nested_list`; `flat_list` now includes the element `i`.**
