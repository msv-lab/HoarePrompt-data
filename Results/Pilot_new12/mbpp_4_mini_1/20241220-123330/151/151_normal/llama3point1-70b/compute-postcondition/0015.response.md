To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we analyze the initial state and the loop's behavior.

Initial State: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure; `flat_list` is an empty list.

The loop iterates through each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list (an integer), it appends `i` to `flat_list`.

1. **If `nested_list` is empty:** The loop does not execute at all. Therefore, `flat_list` remains empty.
   
2. **If `nested_list` contains elements:** 
   - The final state of `flat_list` will be a flattened version of all elements in `nested_list`. All integers from `nested_list` will be included in `flat_list`, and if there are any nested lists, the results of applying `func_1` to each of those lists will also be included.

Thus, regardless of the specific composition of `nested_list`, after all iterations, `flat_list` will contain all integers and the flattened results from any nested lists processed by `func_1`.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to each nested list in `nested_list`.**
