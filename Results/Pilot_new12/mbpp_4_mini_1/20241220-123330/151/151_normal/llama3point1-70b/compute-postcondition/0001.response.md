According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list is non-empty, the loop will execute for each element in the list. Since `flat_list` is empty and the loop is designed to iterate through `nested_list`, we need to ensure that `nested_list` contains at least one element to begin the execution of the loop. Therefore, we will adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
