The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, as no operation is performed on it. Therefore, the impact of the code only reflects the initialization of `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
