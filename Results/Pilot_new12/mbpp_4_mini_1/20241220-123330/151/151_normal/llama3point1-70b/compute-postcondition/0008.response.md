In this scenario, the code indicates that `flatten_list` will be extended by the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is an element from `nested_list`. The specific value of `i` is known, but the output from `func_1` is not specified without its implementation.

Given the conditions, we have:
- `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, meaning that `i` is one of these elements.
- `flat_list` will be updated to include whatever is returned from calling `func_1(i)`.

However, we do not know what `func_1(i)` returns, so we cannot provide a specific updated value for `flat_list`. Instead, we can represent it abstractly.

Thus, the output should reflect that `flat_list` has been modified and retains its previous values along with the output from `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is an element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` is updated to include the results of `func_1(i)`**.
