According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements. The variable `i` will be updated to the third element in the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `flat_list` is updated accordingly**
