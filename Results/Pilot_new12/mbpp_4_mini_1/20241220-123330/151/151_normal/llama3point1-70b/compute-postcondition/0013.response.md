The value of `i` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, it is an element that is currently part of that list. The exact value of `flat_list` is updated to now include this new element `i`, but the previous values of `nested_list` and `i` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `flat_list` is updated to include `i`**.
