The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure. After executing the function body, it returns `flat_list`, which contains all integers extracted from `nested_list` as well as the results of recursively applying `func_1` to each nested list within `nested_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list`, which can contain integers and other lists, and return a flattened list of all integers found in `nested_list` along with the flattened content of any nested lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list and returns a flat list containing all integers from nested_list and the results of applying func_1 to each nested list within nested_list.**
