Given the initial state, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `i` is a list. The expression `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` indicates that the function `func_1()` takes `i` as an argument and presumably returns another list, which will be appended to `flat_list`.

Step by step analysis:
- The code appends the result of `func_1(i)` to `flat_list`.
- As `i` is currently a list (being the first element of `nested_list`), the output of `func_1(i)` will likely be a list as well.
- Since the initial state mentions that `nested_list` contains at least one element and `i` is directly obtained from it, the state of `nested_list` remains valid after execution.

Assuming the function `func_1()` correctly processes lists, it operates on `i`, modifies or processes that data, and outputs another list, which we don't know. However, the important point here is that `flat_list` gets appended with whatever `func_1(i)` returns.

Therefore, the output state will capture that `flat_list` now includes the result of `func_1(i)`, but will not include the exact value since we don't know it.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` which is a list, and `flat_list` has been extended by the result of `func_1(i)`.**
