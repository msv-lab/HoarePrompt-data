According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the content of `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` contains at least 1 element, the loop will iterate through the elements of this list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element being processed from `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 2 elements in `nested_list`.

Since `i` is taken from `nested_list`, after the current iteration, if we want to execute the loop once more, `i` will have to be assigned the next element in `nested_list`. Therefore, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 elements for another iteration to occur.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nested_list`**
