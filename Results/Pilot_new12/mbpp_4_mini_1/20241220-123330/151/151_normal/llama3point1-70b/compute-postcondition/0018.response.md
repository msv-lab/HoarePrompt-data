Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure. It processes this list recursively to create a new list, `flat_list`, which contains all integers extracted from the original `nested_list` as well as all integers from any nested lists found within it. The final state of the program after executing the function is that it returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of the input, containing only integers and discarding any list structures. However, it does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`, which could lead to unintended behavior or erroneous output if encountered.**
