#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to each nested list in `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all integers from nested_list and the results of func_1 applied to each nested list in nested_list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mixture of both, representing a nested structure. It processes this list recursively to create a new list, `flat_list`, which contains all integers extracted from the original `nested_list` as well as all integers from any nested lists found within it. The final state of the program after executing the function is that it returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of the input, containing only integers and discarding any list structures. However, it does not handle cases where elements in `nested_list` might be of types other than `list` or `int`, which could lead to unintended behavior or erroneous output if encountered.
