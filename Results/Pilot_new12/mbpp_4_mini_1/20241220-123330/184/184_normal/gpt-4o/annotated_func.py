#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all the odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing all the odd integers from that list. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle any potential errors related to the input type; if `nums` is not a list of integers, it may raise an error. In summary, the function filters out and captures only the odd integers from the provided list.
