Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that filters and returns odd numbers from a list of integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums`, retaining only those numbers where the condition `num % 2 != 0` (i.e., the number is odd) is met.

The assertions provided are also correct, as they test the function with a variety of input cases, and in each case, the output matches the expected list of odd numbers. Since the function consistently filters out only odd numbers and returns them in a list, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the program meets all specified requirements, and the implementation correctly identifies and returns odd integers from the input list.
