The provided program successfully implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accurately filters odd numbers from a list of integers by using a list comprehension that checks if each number is not divisible by 2. The initial assessment correctly identified the function's logic and the expected outputs based on the provided assertions.

As for the provided output hints, they summarize the function's behavior effectively, confirming that it returns a list of odd integers from the input, including handling an empty list by returning an empty list as well. The point raised about the lack of input type handling does not affect the correctness regarding the filtered output based on the defined problem, as it is assumed that valid input will always be provided. 

Consequently, both the assertions in the original assessment demonstrate that the function performs correctly across various test cases, and the reasoning provided upholds that the function meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
