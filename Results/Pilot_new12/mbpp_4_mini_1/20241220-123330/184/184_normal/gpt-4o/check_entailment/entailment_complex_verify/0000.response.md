Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to filter odd numbers from the list `nums`, as stated in the problem description. The annotations confirm this functionality, demonstrating that the function handles the input as expected and returns the correct outputs for the provided test cases.

- Each assertion in the code accurately reflects the expected output of filtering odd numbers from given lists.
- The annotations clarify that the function is designed to return a list containing only odd integers and that if the input list is empty, it will return an empty list, which is the appropriate behavior.
- The function does not account for input errors, but since we assume valid input (as per the request), this limitation does not impede correctness.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the evidence from the annotations, the conclusion is that the program meets the problem description requirements.
