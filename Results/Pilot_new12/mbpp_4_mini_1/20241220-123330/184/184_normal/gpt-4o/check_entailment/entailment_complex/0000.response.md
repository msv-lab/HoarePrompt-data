Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement described in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's why the program meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and uses a list comprehension to filter and return only the odd integers. The condition `num % 2 != 0` accurately identifies odd numbers.

2. **Return Value**: If the input list contains only odd numbers, it will return the entire list. If the input is empty, the return value will also be an empty list, aligning with the functionality expected for an empty input.

3. **Test Cases**: The assert statements provided validate that the function works as intended for several scenarios, confirming that it correctly filters the odd numbers out from given lists of integers.

4. **Assumptions**: The problem description assumes that the input provided to the function will always be a valid list of integers. Based on this assumption, the function is guaranteed to behave correctly without needing error handling for invalid input types.

Since the implementation adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly addresses all the anticipated cases, it is deemed correct.
