Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of filtering odd numbers from a list. The reason for this is supported by the annotated version of the code, which confirms that the program correctly identifies odd integers within the given list of integers. Additionally, all provided test cases produce the expected outputs, confirming that the implementation is accurate and adheres to the requirements. The annotation also indicates that right before the function call, `nums` is indeed a list of integers, reinforcing that the function operates as intended with valid input. Therefore, the assessment of correctness remains accurate.
