Explanation: The program accurately implements a function to filter odd numbers from a list of integers, adhering to the problem description. The provided examples in the assertions confirm that the function correctly identifies and returns all odd integers from the given lists. The function's logic effectively uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers that satisfy the condition of being odd (i.e., not evenly divisible by 2). Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function will return an empty list when given an empty input list and will not raise errors for valid inputs. Since the assumptions state that inputs will always be valid and the code correctly handles all specified cases in the problem description, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
