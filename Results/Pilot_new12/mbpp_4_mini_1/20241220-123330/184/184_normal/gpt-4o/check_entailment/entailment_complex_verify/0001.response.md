Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` consistently filters out odd numbers from the input list, and the list comprehension effectively captures only those numbers that meet the condition (`num % 2 != 0`). 

The assertions in the program confirm its correctness for the specified test cases, matching the expected output as described in the problem statement. 

Furthermore, the annotated version of the program reiterates that the function returns a list of odd integers, and acknowledges that an empty input list will yield an empty output, which is consistent with the behavior described in the initial assessment. 

Since the function handles all integers correctly, including negatives and zeros, and no errors arise from the stated assumptions about valid inputs, the assessment that the program is correct stands reinforced. Thus, the conclusion is supported by both the original assessment and the annotations.
