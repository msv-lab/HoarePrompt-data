Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list of integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The logic utilized in the function correctly identifies odd integers using the modulus operator and returns them in a new list.

Moreover, the provided output hints reinforce this assessment by stating that the function captures odd integers correctly and handles cases including an empty list. It is also noted that the function does not consider input type errors, which is consistent with the acceptable assumption that valid inputs will always be provided.

Given that the function performs well according to the test cases and meets the described functionality, the final assessment remains true, confirming that it fulfills the requirements as outlined.
