Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The logic used in the list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` properly checks each number to determine if it is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2). 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function produces the expected output for various test cases:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

No edge cases were found that could lead to incorrect behavior, and all the tested inputs work as expected, confirming that the function fulfills the problem description.
