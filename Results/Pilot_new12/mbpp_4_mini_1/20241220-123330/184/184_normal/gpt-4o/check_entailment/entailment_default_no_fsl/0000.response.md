Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers, which it does correctly for the input cases provided in the assertions. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle any potential errors related to input type. Specifically, if the input `nums` is not a list of integers (for example, if it is a string, a dictionary, or contains non-integer values), the function may raise an error. This represents a failure in handling various potential cases as specified in the problem description. Since the program does not correctly handle all potential inputs, it is considered incorrect.
