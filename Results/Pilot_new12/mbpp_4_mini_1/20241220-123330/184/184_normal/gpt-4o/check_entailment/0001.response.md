Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The logic used in the list comprehension (`[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]`) effectively checks each number in the input list and includes it in the resulting list only if it is odd. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves correctly for these test cases. 

Additionally, we can reason that since the function checks the remainder of the number when divided by 2, it works for all integers, including negative numbers and zeros. 

For example:
- For an input of `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, the output would be `[-3, -1, 1, 3]`, which correctly captures all odd numbers.

Since no edge cases or potential incorrect behavior can be identified with the given function and test cases, the function meets the problem description requirements comprehensively.
