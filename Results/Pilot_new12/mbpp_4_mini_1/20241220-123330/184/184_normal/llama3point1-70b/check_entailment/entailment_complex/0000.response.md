Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes one argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **Filtering Logic**: Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in the `nums` list. The expression `num % 2 != 0` checks if the number is odd (i.e., it will return `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers).

3. **Output**: The list comprehension constructs a new list that includes only the numbers for which the condition is `True`, effectively filtering out all even integers. The resulting list contains only the odd integers.

4. **Non-modification of Input**: The comment specifies that the original list `nums` remains unchanged, which adheres to good programming practice.

5. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function handles the case of an empty list by returning an empty list, which is also compliant with the expectations set out in the problem description.

Since the function fulfills the requirements of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers as described in the problem statement, the implementation is indeed correct.
