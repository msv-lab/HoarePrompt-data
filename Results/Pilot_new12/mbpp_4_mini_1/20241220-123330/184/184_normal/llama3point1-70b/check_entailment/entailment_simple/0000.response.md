Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality outlined in the problem description by defining a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The annotated program assumes `nums` is a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description. The prompt indicates that valid inputs will always be provided, so there is no need for additional error handling.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` accurately captures all odd integers. This is done by using modulo operation (`% 2 != 0`), which effectively filters out even numbers, ensuring that only odd numbers are included in the returned list.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list `nums`. 

Since the program adheres to the requirements of filtering odd numbers as stated in the problem description, it is correct.
