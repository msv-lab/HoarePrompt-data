The given problem description states to "write a function to filter odd numbers." The program provided effectively filters out odd numbers correctly by returning a list of odd integers from the input list. The output hints clarify that the function returns a new list containing only odd integers and that it does not modify the original list, which aligns with the program's behavior.

The original assessment contradicts the behavior of the program. It incorrectly claims that the function does not satisfy the requirement, as filtering odd numbers does imply that odd numbers should be included in the output. The assessment states that it incorrectly implies including even numbers, which does not align with the presented logic of the function.

Since the output hints clearly describe the program's behavior and confirm that it does filter odd numbers as intended, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is incorrect. The function is correct based on the described behavior, as it fulfills the task of filtering out odd numbers and providing an accurate output.

Final: **True**
