Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to filter odd numbers from the provided list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums`, checking if each number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). If a number is odd, it is included in the resulting list. 

According to the output hints, the function returns a new list containing only the odd integers, excludes even integers, and does not modify the original list. Additionally, if `nums` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list.

The program handles all outlined scenarios appropriately:
1. It returns a new list of odd numbers.
2. It does not modify the input list.
3. It returns an empty list for empty input.

Since there are no cases where the program does not perform as expected based on the description and given outputs, the correctness is confirmed.
