Based on the problem description, the task is to "write a function to filter odd numbers." The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it interprets the requirement incorrectly as it includes logic only for odd numbers, which results in excluding even numbers from the output. 

The program, in fact, fulfills the requirement of returning odd numbers as specified. The annotated code confirms this; it clearly states that the function returns a list of all odd integers from the input list, filtering out even integers. Hence, the assessment that views the function's output in terms of retaining evens is misplaced, as "filtering odd numbers" directly implies extracting odd values.

Therefore, upon re-evaluation, the program is indeed correct per the problem statement, which explicitly states the goal of filtering odd numbers rather than retaining any even numbers.

Given these considerations, there is justification to revise the original assessment.

Final: **True**
