Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The code uses a list comprehension that checks if each number `num` in `nums` is odd (using the condition `num % 2 != 0`). This means that the function will include all odd integers in the resulting list and exclude all even integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function returns a new list containing only the odd integers and does not modify the original list. It also correctly handles the case when `nums` is empty, returning an empty list as specified. Therefore, the code meets the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.
