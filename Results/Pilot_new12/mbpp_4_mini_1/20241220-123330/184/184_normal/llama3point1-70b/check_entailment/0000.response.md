Correctness: **False**.

The given program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list, but it incorrectly includes the logic for odd numbers. The program uses the condition `num % 2 != 0` to check for odd numbers, which is correct, but the output will not include even numbers.

However, the primary issue is that the requirement to "filter odd numbers" is interpreted incorrectly since "filter" generally implies the inclusion of non-odd numbers (in this case, even numbers) in the output. 

Here's an example of a case where the program does not satisfy the requirement if one expects to retain only the even numbers (which is typically what is meant by filtering):

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Expected output if filtering odd numbers means keeping the rest: `[2, 4]`
- Actual output: `[1, 3, 5]`

Therefore, this demonstrates that the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description.
