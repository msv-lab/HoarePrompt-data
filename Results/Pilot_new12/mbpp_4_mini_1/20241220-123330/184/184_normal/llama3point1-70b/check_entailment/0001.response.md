Correctness: **False**

The problem description requests a function to filter odd numbers, but the provided implementation filters out odd numbers instead of filtering them in. The list comprehension in `func_1` uses the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which means it returns numbers that are *not* even, thus returning only odd numbers, which seems correct at first glance. However, it completely ignores the stipulation for cases where the input might contain non-integer types (like `None`, strings, etc.), which could lead to a runtime error.

For instance, if the function is passed a list containing mixed types like `[1, 2, 'three', None]`, it would raise a `TypeError` on encountering the string because the modulus operation cannot be performed on a string type. Since there is a potential case where the function does not work correctly, the function cannot be deemed correct based on the problem description.
