#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the minimum value in the list 'nums' of integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and it returns the minimum value found in that list. If the input list `nums` is empty, the function would raise a `ValueError`, as the `min` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Therefore, in its final state, the function provides the lowest integer from the list, assuming the list is not empty; otherwise, it results in an error for handling empty input.
