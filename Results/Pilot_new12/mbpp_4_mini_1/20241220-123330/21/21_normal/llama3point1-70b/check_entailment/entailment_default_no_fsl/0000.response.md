Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. According to the problem description, the function is expected to find the smallest number in a list. However, the hints indicate that calling `min` on an empty list raises a `ValueError`, which is not an acceptable output as per the problem requirements. Thus, when provided with an empty list, the function fails to meet the specification of returning the smallest number, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
