Correctness: **True**.

The program uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the provided list `nums`. The `min()` function correctly handles various cases, including:
- A non-empty list of numbers (where it will return the smallest element).
- A list containing a single number, in which case that number is the smallest.
- A list of negative numbers, where it will return the most negative number.
- A list with duplicate numbers, where it will return the value of the duplicates.

The only edge case it doesn't handle is if the input list is empty; however, according to the problem description, it is implied that the function should be able to handle a list of numbers, and the specification does not mention what should happen for an empty list.

Since there are no provided cases where the function fails to find the smallest number given a valid input list, the program is considered correct.
