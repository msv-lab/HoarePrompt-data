Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of integers as input and uses the built-in `min()` function to return the smallest value from that list.

Here's why the program is correct:
1. **Input Validity**: The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, meaning `nums` will always be a list of integers. Therefore, we don't need to handle cases where `nums` is not a list or is empty, as per the problem's assumptions.
2. **Functionality**: The main functionality of the function is to return the minimum value from the given list. The use of `min(nums)` is appropriate since it directly achieves the goal of finding the smallest number.
3. **Simplicity and Effectiveness**: The implementation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to efficiently find the minimum in the list.

Overall, the program meets all expectations outlined in the problem description, thereby confirming its correctness.
