Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic required to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min()` function. The annotations clearly state that the input `nums` is a list of integers, which aligns with the function's intended use. The original assessment correctly identifies that the primary functionality—returning the smallest integer—is properly implemented and supported by the annotations. Although the function does not handle the case of an empty list, the problem description does not specify any requirements for such a scenario. Given the assumption that valid input will always be provided, the function meets the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the correctness assessment remains valid.
