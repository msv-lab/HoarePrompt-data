Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty, which would raise a `ValueError` when calling `min()` on an empty list. This situation violates the problem description, which states that the function should find the smallest number in a list. Therefore, the program does not meet the specifications of the problem, supporting the correctness of the original assessment.
