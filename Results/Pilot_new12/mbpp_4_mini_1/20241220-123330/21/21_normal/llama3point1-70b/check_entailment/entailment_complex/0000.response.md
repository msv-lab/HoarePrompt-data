Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list.

- The function `func_1(nums)` takes a single argument `nums`, which is specified to be a list of integers.
- It utilizes the built-in Python function `min()` to find and return the smallest integer from this list.
- The function's comment accurately describes its behavior, stating that it returns the minimum value in the list, which meets the requirement set out in the problem description.
- While it is noted that the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, the assumption is that the input will always be valid and will not cause errors, consistent with the criteria given for this evaluation. Therefore, we do not need to consider the behavior for empty lists in this verification.

In summary, given the problem description and the function's implementation, the program behaves as expected and fulfills the requirements of the task.
