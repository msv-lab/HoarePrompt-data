Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. Calling `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, for the potential input `[]`, the function will not work as expected by the problem description, which states that it should find the smallest number in a list. As a result, the program is incorrect.
