#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst', which contains numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers `lst` and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the use of the `min` function, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, a crucial edge case regarding empty lists is not addressed.
