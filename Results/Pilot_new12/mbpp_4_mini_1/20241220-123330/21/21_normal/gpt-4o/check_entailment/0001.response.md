Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the smallest number in a list by utilizing the built-in `min` function, which is effective for this purpose. The provided assertions confirm that it works for multiple test cases. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the cases checked:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is again correct.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, the smallest number in this list.

Since all tested cases yield the expected output, and the logic used is sound for finding the minimum value, the program adheres to the problem description. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause it to fail. Thus, the code is verified as correct.
