Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The utilization of Python's built-in `min` function effectively satisfies this requirement. 

The provided assertions confirm the correctness across multiple test cases:
1. The assertion `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returning `1` aligns with the expected outcome. 
2. The assertion `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returning `1` is also correct and expected.
3. Lastly, the assertion `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` confirms that `45` is correctly identified as the smallest number.

The annotations further support these conclusions by clearly stating the state of the list `lst` before the function call and the indication that the function returns the minimum value. Since all provided inputs lean towards valid and expected outputs within the constraints given (i.e., assuming valid input), the program fulfills the problem's requirements without malfunction or oversight. Thus, the program's correctness is validated.
