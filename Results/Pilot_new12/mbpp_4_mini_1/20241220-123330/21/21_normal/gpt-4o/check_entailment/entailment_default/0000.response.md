Explanation: The provided code correctly implements a function to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min` function. According to the output hints, the function handles several test cases successfully, returning the expected minimum values for each given list. However, the output hints point out a critical issue: if `func_1` is called with an empty list, it will raise a `ValueError`, an edge case that is not handled by the code. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for every potential case, as it does not provide a valid return for an empty list.

Correctness: **False**.
