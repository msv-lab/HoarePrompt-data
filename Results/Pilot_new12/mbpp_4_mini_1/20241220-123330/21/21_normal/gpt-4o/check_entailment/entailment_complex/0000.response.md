Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find the smallest number in a list as per the problem description. However, it does not handle the situation where the input list could potentially be empty. While the problem description assumes valid input, the fact that the function `min(lst)` raises a `ValueError` when called with an empty list constitutes a failure to meet the requirements as expected. 

In summary, since an empty list is a possible edge case and the current implementation does not appropriately handle it, the function does not always do what the problem description says. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
