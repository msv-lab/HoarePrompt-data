Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty list. The `min` function will raise a `ValueError` if called with an empty list, which is not addressed in the code. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. An example of an input that causes the issue is `func_1([])`, which would raise an error instead of returning a valid result.
