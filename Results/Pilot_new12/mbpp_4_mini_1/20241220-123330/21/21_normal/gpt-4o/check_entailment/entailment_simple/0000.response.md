Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` is correct because it accurately finds and returns the smallest number in a list, as specified in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:
1. **Functionality**: The function utilizes Python's built-in `min()` function to determine the smallest value within the provided list `lst`. This directly aligns with the requirement to find the smallest number in a list.
2. **Test Cases**: The assertions directly test the function against various inputs, demonstrating that it works correctly in those cases.
3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem statement allows for the assumption that the input will always be valid. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., empty lists or non-list inputs) as it's based on the premise that valid input is guaranteed.

Since `func_1` behaves as required by the problem description for all expected inputs, we conclude that it is implemented correctly.
