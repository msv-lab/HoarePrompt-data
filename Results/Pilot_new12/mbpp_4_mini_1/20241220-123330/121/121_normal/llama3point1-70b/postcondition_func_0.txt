The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. If `n` is less than 2, it returns False, as numbers less than 2 are not prime. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any of these integers divide `n` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not handle edge cases like negative integers or non-integer inputs, which would lead to incorrect behavior if such values are passed.
