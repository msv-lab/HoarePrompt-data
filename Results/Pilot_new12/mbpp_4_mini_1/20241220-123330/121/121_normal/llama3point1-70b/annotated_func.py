    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `i` is in the range from 2 to `int(n)` where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. If `n` is less than 2, it returns False, as numbers less than 2 are not prime. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any of these integers divide `n` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not handle edge cases like negative integers or non-integer inputs, which would lead to incorrect behavior if such values are passed.

                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is equal to `7 + n - 1` if the function `func_1(num)` returns true for the last value of `num` checked that satisfies the condition `num % 6` in [1, 5]. If `func_1(num)` never returns true or `num % 6` is never 1 or 5 for any iteration, the values of `count` will remain less than `n` and `count` will be greater than the initial value 1.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n >= 1`) and aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it directly returns 7. For values of `n` greater than 1, it initializes a counter and starts from the number 7, incrementing it to check if it is prime using `func_1(num)`. It only counts the primes that meet the additional condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5. The function continues to iterate, returning the nth prime number that satisfies these conditions. However, if no such prime is found that meets the conditions, the loop can potentially run indefinitely, indicating a missing edge case handling for situations where a valid nth prime cannot be found. The values returned can be 7, or the relevant prime numbers greater than 7, such as 8 or 9, depending on the output of `func_1(num)`.
