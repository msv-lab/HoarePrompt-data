To verify the program based on the provided problem description, we will analyze the implementation in the context of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

The criteria for a number \( n \) to be a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime are:
1. \( n \) must be a prime number.
2. \( n \mod 6 \) must be either 1 or 5.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of \( n \). The logic seems sound.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - The function returns 7 for the first prime directly, which is correct since 7 is the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.
   - The function keeps count of how many Newman–Shanks–Williams primes it has found.
   - It checks if a number is prime using `func_1(num)` and then checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 before incrementing the count.

Now, let’s identify any potential cases where the program might fail:

1. **Verification of Prime Check**:
   - The prime checking logic only excludes numbers less than 2, which is good. However, it may have missed edge cases concerning very large numbers or those at the boundaries of prime numbers. 
   - That said, the check itself is quite complete.

2. **Logic of Finding Newman–Shanks–Williams Primes**:
   - The function looks only at numbers greater than or equal to 7 (the first N-S-W prime). It correctly skips even numbers since they won't qualify as they will always yield modulo 6 results of 0 (except for 2) and will never satisfy the conditions for N-S-W primes.
   - The increment of `num` continuously checks each number starting from 7, which allows identification of all qualifying primes as long as it accounts for the conditions.

3. **Specific Tests**:
   - If one were to test the function with varying \( n \) values (e.g., for \( n = 2, 3, 4 \), etc.), the loop seems robust enough to keep counting until it finds the correct nth prime. Yet:
   - If \( n \) were to increase significantly, it should never run infinitely and should find the correct output plausible by virtue of prime density theory.
   - However, the check for correctness of first few N-S-W primes is needed: they are 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. The tests should return exactly those for respective \( n \) positions. 

Now, even with a significant upper edge case like performance, let's verify a theoretical problem where it may fail. If looking for very large values of \( n \), numerical efficiency must also be assured in computation; thus, relying purely on naive checking could potentially slow down and misrepresent expected results, leading to assurance of completion within reasonable limits.

To summarize, while the logic singles out prime identification and the N-S-W criteria well, edge cases for extremely high \( n \) or transitions through boundary values in the very set of \( n \) may subtly lead to miscounts or misses especially near sequence boundaries.

Thus, based on the data reviewed:

Correctness: **False**. 

Potential Issue: The program may run inefficiently or incorrectly with very high values of \( n \) due to its linear search for primes which, though it generally finds the right prime, does not account for performance or boundary edge cases well.
