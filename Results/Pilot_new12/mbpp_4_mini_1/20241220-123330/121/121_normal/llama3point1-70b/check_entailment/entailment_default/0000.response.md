The provided code attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Let's analyze the functions one by one based on the problem description and output hints:

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- This function checks if a number `n` is a prime.
- It correctly identifies prime numbers as described, returning `False` for values less than 2 and performing a check for factors up to the square root of `n`.
- Output hint mentions that it does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

### Function 2: `func_2(n)`
- This function is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, returning 7 for n=1 and searching for subsequent primes for n > 1.
- The function contains a loop that checks each number to see if it's prime using `func_1`. 
- It checks if the number `num % 6` equals 1 or 5 to determine if it counts towards the nth prime.
- The potential issue raised in the output hints is that this function could run indefinitely if it fails to find the nth prime that meets the criteria because thereâ€™s no exit condition for the while loop other than a successful return.

### Key Analysis
The hints suggest that if no nth prime satisfying the conditions is found, the loop would run indefinitely, violating the expected behavior of the function. Furthermore, the description and hints do not mention how the implementation handles cases where the input n is less than 1 or when the sequence does not reach an n-th prime, making the implementation incomplete in handling these edge cases.

In conclusion, the program indeed fails to meet the requirements as it could lead to an infinite loop. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle cases where the nth prime cannot be found or where n is invalid.

Correctness: **False**.
