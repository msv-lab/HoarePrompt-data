Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Specifically, the annotations imply that for values of `n` greater than 1, the function searches for prime numbers that meet the additional condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5. However, there are concerns regarding the logic that:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The loop within `func_2` can run indefinitely if the numbers being checked for primality do not satisfy the condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5 while being prime. This is not addressed in the function, which means there are valid inputs (e.g., `n` as any integer greater than 1) for which the function may never return a result.

2. **Failure to Generate List of Primes**: The method employed assumes that there will always be enough primes of the required form (that meet `num % 6 in [1, 5]`), which is not guaranteed. There could be cases where such primes do not exist beyond certain limits, depending on `n`.

Due to these issues, the code does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description in every potential case, leading to an incorrect classification of its overall correctness.
