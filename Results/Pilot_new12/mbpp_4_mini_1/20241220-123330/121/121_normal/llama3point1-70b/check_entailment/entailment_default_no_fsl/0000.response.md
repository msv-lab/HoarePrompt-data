Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. For instance, the `func_2` function gets stuck in an infinite loop if it cannot find a valid nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number that meets the conditions specified (not necessarily due to any lack of prime numbers). While the prime numbers themselves are generally valid, the condition of `num % 6 in [1, 5]` could lead to situations where no further prime numbers are generated which satisfy this condition.

Moreover, while the description might imply dealing with valid inputs of type integer, the output hints for `func_1` suggest that it does not accommodate negative or non-integer inputs explicitly. This lack of handling could lead to incorrect behavior in practice, even though we assume valid integer inputs in this context. 

Therefore, these factors mean the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to a final correctness of **False**.
