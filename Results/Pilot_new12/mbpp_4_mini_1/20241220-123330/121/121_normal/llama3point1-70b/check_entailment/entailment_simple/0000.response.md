Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately fulfills the problem description, which requires the creation of a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Here’s how it works:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function checks if a given number `n` is prime. It correctly verifies if a number is less than 2 (not prime) and iterates through potential divisors up to the square root of `n` to determine its primality. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function identifies the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
   - It starts by returning 7 when `n` equals 1, as known from the sequence of these primes.
   - It continuously increments through numbers starting from 7, using `func_1` to check for primality, and also ensures that the numbers checked are of the form `6k ± 1` (i.e., `num % 6` in [1, 5]), which is necessary because all primes greater than 3 fit this pattern. 
   - It maintains a count of valid primes found and returns the nth one when it reaches the desired count.

Thus, the program logically aligns with the requirement to compute and return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number correctly. Each function functions as intended, and the constraints of input validity are respected as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and adheres to the requirements.
