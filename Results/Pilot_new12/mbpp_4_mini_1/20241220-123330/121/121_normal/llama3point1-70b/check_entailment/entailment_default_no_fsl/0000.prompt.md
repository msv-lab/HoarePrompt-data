You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. If `n` is less than 2, it returns False, as numbers less than 2 are not prime. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any of these integers divide `n` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not handle edge cases like negative integers or non-integer inputs, which would lead to incorrect behavior if such values are passed.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n >= 1`) and aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it directly returns 7. For values of `n` greater than 1, it initializes a counter and starts from the number 7, incrementing it to check if it is prime using `func_1(num)`. It only counts the primes that meet the additional condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5. The function continues to iterate, returning the nth prime number that satisfies these conditions. However, if no such prime is found that meets the conditions, the loop can potentially run indefinitely, indicating a missing edge case handling for situations where a valid nth prime cannot be found. The values returned can be 7, or the relevant prime numbers greater than 7, such as 8 or 9, depending on the output of `func_1(num)`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
