You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer that represents a number to be checked for primality.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since n is a non-negative integer and its current value is less than 2, indicating that it is not prime.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is an integer in the range from 2 to `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `i` is in the range from 2 to `int(n)` where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. If `n` is less than 2, it returns False, as numbers less than 2 are not prime. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any of these integers divide `n` evenly, it returns False, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. The function does not handle edge cases like negative integers or non-integer inputs, which would lead to incorrect behavior if such values are passed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is equal to `7 + n - 1` if the function `func_1(num)` returns true for the last value of `num` checked that satisfies the condition `num % 6` in [1, 5]. If `func_1(num)` never returns true or `num % 6` is never 1 or 5 for any iteration, the values of `count` will remain less than `n` and `count` will be greater than the initial value 1.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n >= 1`) and aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it directly returns 7. For values of `n` greater than 1, it initializes a counter and starts from the number 7, incrementing it to check if it is prime using `func_1(num)`. It only counts the primes that meet the additional condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5. The function continues to iterate, returning the nth prime number that satisfies these conditions. However, if no such prime is found that meets the conditions, the loop can potentially run indefinitely, indicating a missing edge case handling for situations where a valid nth prime cannot be found. The values returned can be 7, or the relevant prime numbers greater than 7, such as 8 or 9, depending on the output of `func_1(num)`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
