To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the code against the problem description of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

1. **Understanding Newman-Shanks-Williams Primes**:
   The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes (NSW primes) are a known sequence of prime numbers wherein the first few are: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, etc. The specified program aims to find the nth number in this series.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(n)**:
     - This function checks if the input number `n` is prime, which is required to identify the NSW primes.
     - It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and implements an efficient check for primality.

   - **func_2(n)**:
     - This function handles the actual computation of finding the nth NSW prime.
     - It initializes a count and starts checking with the prime number `7`.
     - For each candidate number, it checks if the number is prime using `func_1(n)` and if it is congruent to `1` or `5` mod `6`, as NSW primes must satisfy this condition.

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The starting value `num` is set to `7`, which is the first NSW prime, and the count starts at `1`.
   - The loop continues to increment `num` checking for both primality and the modulus condition. Once the count reaches `n`, it returns that number.

4. **Finding Edge Cases**:
   - Let's evaluate potential cases:
     - If `n = 1`, it correctly returns `7`.
     - If `n = 2`, it will correctly find the next NSW prime `11`, and so on.
     - The program appears to satisfy the conditions for all prime candidates and the specified modulus condition.

5. **Checking for Missing Cases**:
   - A notable missing case could be if the input `n` is less than `1`. The description doesn't specify handling for such cases. This means that if `n` were `0`, the function would start searching for primes but never increment the count since it's initialized to `1` and could lead to an infinite loop (unless it somehow reaches a solution which is highly unlikely).

Given this evaluation, there is a loophole in input handling:
- The program does not account for when `n` is less than `1`, which could lead to unintended infinite loops or other logical errors. Thus, the program could fail, leading us to:

Correctness: **False** 

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not handle cases where `n` < 1, resulting in potential infinite loops or errors when calling the function.
