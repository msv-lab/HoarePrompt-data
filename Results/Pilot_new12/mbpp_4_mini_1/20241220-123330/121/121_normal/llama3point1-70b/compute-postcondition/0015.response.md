The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Its previous value is 7, so after the operation, `num` becomes 8. The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and if the result of `func_1(num)` is true and the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and is not equal to `n`.**
