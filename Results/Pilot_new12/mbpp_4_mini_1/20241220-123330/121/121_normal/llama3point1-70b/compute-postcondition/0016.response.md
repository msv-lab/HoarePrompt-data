Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is guaranteed to execute at least one more time regardless of the program state. Therefore, there are no modifications necessary for the current state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, and if the result of `func_1(num)` is true and the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, then `count` is updated to 2 and is not equal to `n`.**
