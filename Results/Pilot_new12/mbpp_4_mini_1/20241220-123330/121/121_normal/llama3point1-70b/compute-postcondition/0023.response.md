Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit break condition in the loop body that terminates it. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop can execute one more time without requiring any adjustments to the program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 9**.
