Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is equal to `7 + n - 1` if the function `func_1(num)` returns true for the last value of `num` checked that satisfies the condition `num % 6` in [1, 5]. If `func_1(num)` never returns true or `num % 6` is never 1 or 5 for any iteration, the values of `count` will remain less than `n` and `count` will be greater than the initial value 1.`**
