The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, the result of `func_1(num)` is true, and the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
