Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 3, and `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` returns true, and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 while `count` equals `n`, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 8. In any other case, there is no return value.***
