The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 3, so after executing the code, `count` will be 4. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation on `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is now 4; `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is 4; `num` is 9**.
