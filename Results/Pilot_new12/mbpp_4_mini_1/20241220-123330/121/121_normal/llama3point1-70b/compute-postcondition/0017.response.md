To analyze the code snippet provided, we first look at the initial state. The variables are defined as:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1 (so `n` is at least 2).
- `count` is 2.
- `num` is 8.

Next, we examine what the code does:

```
count += 1
```

This line of code increments `count` by 1. Since `count` starts at 2, after the execution of this line, `count` will become 3.

No other variables are modified by this operation. The conditions mentioned regarding `func_1(num)` and the result of `num % 6` do not affect the operation of `count += 1` directly, but we also note that `num % 6` returns 2 because `8 % 6 = 2`, which means that `num` does not fulfill the conditional check since it is neither 1 nor 5.

Thus the output state will reflect the new value of `count`, while `n` and `num` retain their original assignments.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 8**.
