In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement or some form of termination condition inside the loop itself.

Since the loop executes without any condition that prevents it from running, it is guaranteed to be able to execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no changes are needed to ensure that the loop can run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
