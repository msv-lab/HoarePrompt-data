The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `count`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, it continues to hold its validity. Thus, the output state reflects only the updated value of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 1**
