The variable `num` is assigned the value `7`. The other variables `n` and `count` remain unchanged. Since the initial state assures that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, the conditions for `n` hold true. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
