Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1, `count` is 4, and `num` is 9. If `func_1(num)` evaluates to True, `count` is updated to 4, and if `num % 6` is in [1, 5] and `count` equals `n`, the function returns 9. If `count` does not equal `n`, the function does not return any value.***
