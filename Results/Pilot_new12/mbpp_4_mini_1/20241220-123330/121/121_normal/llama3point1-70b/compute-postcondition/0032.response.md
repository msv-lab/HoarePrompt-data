Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n >= 1`) and aims to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, it directly returns 7. For values of `n` greater than 1, it initializes a counter and starts from the number 7, incrementing it to check if it is prime using `func_1(num)`. It only counts the primes that meet the additional condition of `num % 6` being 1 or 5. The function continues to iterate, returning the nth prime number that satisfies these conditions. However, if no such prime is found that meets the conditions, the loop can potentially run indefinitely, indicating a missing edge case handling for situations where a valid nth prime cannot be found. The values returned can be 7, or the relevant prime numbers greater than 7, such as 8 or 9, depending on the output of `func_1(num)`.**
