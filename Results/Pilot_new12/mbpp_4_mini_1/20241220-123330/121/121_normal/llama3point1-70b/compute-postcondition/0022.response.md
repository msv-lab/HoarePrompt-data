The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num` is 8, so the new value of `num` will be 9. The other variables `n` and `count` remain unchanged, and since the condition involving `func_1(num)` and `num % 6` is not evaluated in this snippet, it doesn't affect the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 9.**
