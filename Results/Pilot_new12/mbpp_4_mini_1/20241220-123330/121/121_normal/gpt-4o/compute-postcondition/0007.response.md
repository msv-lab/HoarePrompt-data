According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates starting from `i = 2` up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again and `i` will be increased by 1. 

That means the new value of `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, it must hold that `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, which is now 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
