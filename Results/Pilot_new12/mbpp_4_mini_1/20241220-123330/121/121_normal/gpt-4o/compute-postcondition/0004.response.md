To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute based on the provided state and loop condition, let's analyze the components:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1` (inclusive of 2, exclusive of `n + 1`). This means `i` will take values starting from 2 up to and including `n`.

2. **Initial Values**: Before the loop starts, we have the following states:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than 1. This means `n` could be 2 or higher.
   - The variables `S0` and `S1` are set to 1 but are not directly relevant to the loop iteration.

3. **First Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute, we need to check the starting value of `i`, which is 2 in the first iteration (since `range(2, n + 1)` starts at 2). 

4. **Verifying Executable Conditions**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, the range will effectively be valid because it will result in at least one iteration (for `n = 2`, `i` will take the value 2).
   - `i` is initialized at the beginning of the loop and will be set to 2 at the start of the first iteration.

Hence, the existing state does allow for the loop to execute. However, we will explicitly state the conditions for clarity.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2**
