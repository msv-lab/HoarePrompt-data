Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1. For any integer `n` greater than 1, it computes the value at position `n` in a specific sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, where `S0` and `S1` are initialized to 1. The function ultimately returns this computed value at position `n`, which is represented by `S1`. Notably, there is no handling for negative integers, and the function does not validate input types, meaning it may raise an error if a non-integer is passed.**
