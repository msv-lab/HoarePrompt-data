According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `i`, which starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
