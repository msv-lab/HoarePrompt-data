The variable `S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 1 and `S0` is 1, we can perform the calculation: `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1` which results in `S_next = 2 + 1 = 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
