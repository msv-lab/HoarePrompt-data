The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` assigns new values to `S0` and `S1`. Specifically, `S0` is assigned the value of `S1`, which is 1, and `S1` is assigned the value of `S_next`, which is 3. The affected variables are `S0` and `S1`, while the other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the updated values will be `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
