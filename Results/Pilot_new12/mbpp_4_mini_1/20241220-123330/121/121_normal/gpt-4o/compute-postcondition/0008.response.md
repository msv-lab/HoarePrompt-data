The variable `S_next` is assigned the value calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 3 and `S0` is 1, we can compute the value as follows: `S_next = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
