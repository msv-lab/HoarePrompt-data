After executing the code, the values of `S0` and `S1` are updated. `S0` is assigned the previous value of `S1`, which is 3, and `S1` is assigned the value of `S_next`, which is 7. 

Therefore, the updated values of the affected variables are:
- `S0` is now 3,
- `S1` is now 7.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**.
