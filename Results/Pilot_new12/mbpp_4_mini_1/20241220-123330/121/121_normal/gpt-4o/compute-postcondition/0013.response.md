The loop executes the recurrence relation to compute values in a sequence based on the prior two values, starting from `S0` and `S1`. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `S0` and `S1` would hold the last two computed values of the sequence.

For each iteration of the loop:
- `S_next` is calculated based on the last two values, `S1` and `S0`.
- `S0` and `S1` are updated to hold the last two values for the next iteration.

After the loop completes:
- If the loop has executed `(n - 1)` times, the final values of `S0` and `S1` will correspond to the 1-indexed position `n` in the sequence, with `S0` holding the value from position `n-1` and `S1` holding the value from position `n`.

The output state includes all the relationships that must hold after looping for all iterations given that `n` is originally greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value from position `n-1` in the sequence, `S1` is the value from position `n` in the sequence.**
