The code assigns the values of `S1` and `S_next` to `S0` and `S1` respectively. We start with the initial values: `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, and `S_next` is 17. After the execution, `S0` will take the value of `S1` (which is 7), and `S1` will take the value of `S_next` (which is 17). Therefore, after the execution:

- `S0` will be 7.
- `S1` will be 17.

The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**.
