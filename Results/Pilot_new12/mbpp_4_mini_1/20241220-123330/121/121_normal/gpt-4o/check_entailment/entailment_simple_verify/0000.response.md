Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the implementation of `func_1` does not compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number as required by the problem description. The function generates a sequence aligned more closely with the recurrence similar to Fibonacci numbers rather than calculating prime numbers. 

The annotations further reaffirm this: the function returns 1 for both `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, it returns numbers derived from a recurrence relation without any filtering for primality. For instance, it incorrectly handles the case where it should return the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime (which is 3) and would instead return 1 for `n=2`. 

Thus, the overall functionality of the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, confirming the original assessment of its correctness as **False**.
