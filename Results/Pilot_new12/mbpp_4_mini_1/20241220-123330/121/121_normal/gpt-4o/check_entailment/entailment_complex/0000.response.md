Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Instead, the implementation appears to compute values from a different sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes**: Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers. The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 43, 47, etc.

2. **Implementation of the Function**: The function `func_1` computes terms based on a recurrence relation that does not correspond to generating or identifying prime numbers. The computed values are not necessarily prime, and the sequence generated does not represent the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

3. **Expected Output**: The function is expected to return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime based on the problem description. However, the assertions provided in the program (e.g., `assert func_1(3) == 7`) do not relate to the output of `func_1`, which incorrectly computes values based on the defined recurrence relation.

In conclusion, the implementation fails to align with the mandated requirement of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, thus failing the correctness check.
