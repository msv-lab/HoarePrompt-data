Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic required to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The annotations provide a clear understanding of the state of the variables within the function, but they do not alter the fact that `func_1` is generating a sequence based on a specific recurrence relation rather than the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

The assertions made at the beginning indicate expected outputs; however, upon examination, while `func_1(3)` producing 7 matches the expected value for the third prime in the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, `func_1(4)` yields 17 which is incorrect (it should yield 11) and higher cases also fail to return the intended prime numbers. The function only outputs the sequence generated by the recurrence relation without validating or generating them as prime numbers.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description aimed at producing Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, justifying the conclusion of "False" for correctness.
