Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it is tasked with finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the provided code does not implement that functionality. Instead, the code calculates a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which is not related to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

Specifically, the confirmed examples show that `func_1(3)` returns `7`, `func_1(4)` returns `17`, and `func_1(5)` returns `41`, which corresponds to the sequence generated by the code, but these values are not the actual Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

Therefore, while the code might calculate a specific series of numbers, it does not fulfill the problem's requirement to return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, thus leading to the conclusion that it lacks the correct implementation for the task.
