You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The function `func_1` is attempting to generate a sequence based on a recurrence relation, but it does not incorporate the logic specifically needed to generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. The algorithm used in the given function does not generate these primes but instead produces a sequence of integers that follows a specific recurrence relation.

For example:
- `func_1(3)` should return 7, which matches the assertion.
- However, `func_1(4)` is expected to yield the 4th prime number in the sequence, which should be 11, but based on the logic in the function, it computes a different value.

Additionally, the function doesn't correctly address or return an actual prime number sequence. The assertions in the initial part of the code do not convincingly demonstrate that the function is correctly returning the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.

Therefore, since the function does not solve the problem as described for inputs beyond the first few cases and fails to align with the prime number requirement, it is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1. For any integer `n` greater than 1, it computes the value at position `n` in a specific sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, where `S0` and `S1` are initialized to 1. The function ultimately returns this computed value at position `n`, which is represented by `S1`. Notably, there is no handling for negative integers, and the function does not validate input types, meaning it may raise an error if a non-integer is passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
