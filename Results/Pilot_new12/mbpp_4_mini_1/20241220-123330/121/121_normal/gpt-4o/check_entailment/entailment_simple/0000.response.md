The provided program aims to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number based on the problem description. However, upon analysis, it is clear that the implementation does not meet the requirements.

The sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes should be constructed differently. The implementation provided in the program computes a sequence that resembles the Fibonacci series, but does not correctly produce the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

The known primes in this sequence, for instance, start as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on, but the implementation is returning numbers based on incorrect mathematical formulations.

For instance:
- For `n=3`, the program returns `7`, which is correct.
- However, for `n=4`, the expected 4th prime in sequence is `11`, but the program returns `17`.
- For `n=5`, it again fails to return the correct prime, as the expected output should be different from what's computed.

Thus, it fails to provide the correct nth prime in the sequence according to the Newman-Shanks-Williams criteria.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime correctly, as it follows an incorrect sequence logic.
