Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number based on the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. However, the implementation does not correspond to the definition of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The sequence derived from `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` does not generate prime numbers but rather a series of integers that include non-primes as well. 

In fact, the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers start with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., none of which is guaranteed by the values returned by the given program, as it instead produces `1, 1, 3, 7, 17,...`, which are not necessarily prime. Hence, the logic does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
