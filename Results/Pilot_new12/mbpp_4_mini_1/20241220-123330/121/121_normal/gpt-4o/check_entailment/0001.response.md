Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The function `func_1` is attempting to generate a sequence based on a recurrence relation, but it does not incorporate the logic specifically needed to generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. The algorithm used in the given function does not generate these primes but instead produces a sequence of integers that follows a specific recurrence relation.

For example:
- `func_1(3)` should return 7, which matches the assertion.
- However, `func_1(4)` is expected to yield the 4th prime number in the sequence, which should be 11, but based on the logic in the function, it computes a different value.

Additionally, the function doesn't correctly address or return an actual prime number sequence. The assertions in the initial part of the code do not convincingly demonstrate that the function is correctly returning the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.

Therefore, since the function does not solve the problem as described for inputs beyond the first few cases and fails to align with the prime number requirement, it is considered incorrect.
