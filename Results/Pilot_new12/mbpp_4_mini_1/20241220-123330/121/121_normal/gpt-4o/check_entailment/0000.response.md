Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the implementation does not compute prime numbers, but rather appears to generate a sequence related to the Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, the function will give incorrect results for most inputs regarding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.

For example, when calling `func_1(2)`, the function will return `1`, but the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number is `3`, which demonstrates that the implementation does not meet the specified requirements.
