Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number as described in the problem statement. The code is based on a recurrence relation that generates a sequence of numbers starting from specific values. Although it correctly returns values for the initial cases (like `func_1(3) = 7`), it fails to align with the description of generating the specific prime number sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The logic to identify prime numbers is absent, and returns values that do not match the actual nth prime numbers when n is greater than the initial cases checked, such as `func_1(4)`, which is expected to yield 11. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description's requirements, confirming its correctness as **False**.
