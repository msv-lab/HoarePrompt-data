Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description. It is meant to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the implementation instead calculates values based on a recurrence relation similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence. The results for the assertions provided in the original assessment demonstrate this discrepancy:

- `func_1(3)` returns `7`, which is incorrect since the third Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is `5`.
- `func_1(4)` returns `17`, which is again incorrect because the fourth prime is `11`.
- `func_1(5)` returns `41`, which is not accurate as the fifth prime is `19`.

Therefore, the annotated version further substantiates the original conclusion, showing that while the function executes correctly and returns values based on its defined logic, these values do not correspond to the intended prime number outputs. Thus, the conclusion of the program's correctness remains **False**.
