Functionality: **The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that combines the elements of `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple`, after converting the tuple's elements to a list. The function correctly handles empty lists and tuples, returning just the other collection, as well as cases where both the list and tuple are empty, resulting in an empty list. There are no additional edge cases or missing logic in the current implementation.**
