Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem statement asks for a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. However, the implementation of the function returns a new list that is a concatenation of `input_list` and `list(input_tuple)`. 

The confusion arises here: the problem description implies that the elements of the tuple should be added to the list, but the function as written combines the two as separate collections. This means that if `input_list` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `input_tuple` is `(4, 5)`, the return value will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, rather than adding the tuple’s elements individually or modifying the original list in place.

Additionally, it does not modify `input_list` itself but instead creates a new list, which diverges from the typical expectation when one refers to "adding" an item to a list.

To summarize, the function does not directly add the tuple’s elements to the list as the problem description suggests, making it incorrect.
