Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem explicitly asks for a function that adds the given tuple to the given list. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new list that is the result of concatenating the original list with the elements of the tuple (after converting the tuple to a list). This means that the original list remains unchanged, and the program deviates from the expectation implied by the problem description that suggests an addition (or appending) of the tuple to the list should be performed directly on the list itself.

If the intent were to modify `input_list` by adding the elements of `input_tuple`, it should utilize a method like `input_list.extend(input_tuple)` or `input_list += input_tuple`, which directly alters the original list. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirement that suggests the tuple should be added to the list. The function as it stands creates a new list rather than effectively modifying the provided list.
