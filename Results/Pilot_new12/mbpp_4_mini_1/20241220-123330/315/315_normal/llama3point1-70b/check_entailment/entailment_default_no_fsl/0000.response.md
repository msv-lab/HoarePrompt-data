Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to add the given tuple to the given list. It achieves this by concatenating the list with the converted tuple (to a list). 

The function returns a new list that correctly combines `input_list` and `input_tuple`. Specifically:

1. If either `input_list` or `input_tuple` is empty, the function still returns the other collection unchanged, which is the expected behavior.
2. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are empty, the function returns an empty list, which is also correct.
3. There are no additional edge cases or logic that need to be considered as the function adequately handles all specified scenarios.

Thus, the program accurately follows the problem description for every potential case.
