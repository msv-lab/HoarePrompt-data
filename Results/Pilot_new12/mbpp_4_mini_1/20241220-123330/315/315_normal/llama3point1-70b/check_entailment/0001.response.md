Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as input, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it to the original list. This effectively adds all elements of the tuple to the end of the list.

I can reason about a few potential cases:

1. Adding an empty tuple to a list: 
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

2. Adding a tuple with multiple elements to a list:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5))` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is correct.

3. Adding a tuple with a single element to a list:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4,))` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is also correct.

4. Adding to an already empty list:
   - `func_1([], (1, 2, 3))` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

In all cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct for all input scenarios described.
