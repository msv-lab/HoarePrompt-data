The provided program correctly implements the addition of a tuple to a list as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an input list and an input tuple, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it to the input list. 

The output hints confirm that the function works properly for all specified cases, including handling empty lists and tuples correctly. When both lists and tuples are empty, it correctly returns an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Since the function operates as intended for all edge cases outlined in the hints and the problem description, there are no scenarios where it fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
