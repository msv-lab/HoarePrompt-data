Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to add a given tuple to a given list. However, it treats the tuple as a sequence of elements and converts it to a list, but then it does not properly handle the case where the tuple might contain nested tuples or different types of data. 

For instance, if I input a list and a tuple containing another tuple:
```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, (5, 6))
```
The expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, (5, 6)]` since the tuple itself is being added to the list. However, the program outputs:
```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
Because of the inner tuple unpacking, it does not preserve the structure of the input tuple correctly.

Hence, the program does not abide by the problem description for all potential cases.
