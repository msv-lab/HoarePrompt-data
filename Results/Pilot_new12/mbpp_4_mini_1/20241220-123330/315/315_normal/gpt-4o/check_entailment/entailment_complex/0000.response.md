The program appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as input and concatenates the two, effectively combining the elements of both into a new list.

1. The function's input types are as specified: it accepts a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`).
2. The operation performed in the function (`lst + list(tpl)`) correctly combines the two, returning a new list that consists of all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from `tpl`.
3. The assertions provided further confirm that the function behaves as expected in several test cases, demonstrating that the output matches the anticipated result of concatenating the list and tuple.

Additionally, the program correctly accounts for the case where the tuple is empty. In this case, concatenation with an empty tuple would simply result in a copy of the original list, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

Since the program handles valid input according to the problem description and provides the expected results in all tested scenarios, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

This is because the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly implementing the addition of a tuple to a list and returning the expected output in each case.
