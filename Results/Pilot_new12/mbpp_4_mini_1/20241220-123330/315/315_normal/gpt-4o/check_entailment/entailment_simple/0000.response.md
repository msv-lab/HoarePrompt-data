Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which adds the given tuple to the given list. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the problem requirements:

1. The function takes two parameters: `lst`, which is expected to be a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple.
2. The return statement `return lst + list(tpl)` concatenates the original list `lst` with the list created from the tuple `tpl` using `list(tpl)`.
3. This satisfies the requirement to add the elements of the tuple to the list as the problem description specifies. 

The provided assertions further verify that the implementation behaves as expected for the given test cases, confirming that the function correctly produces the desired output by combining the contents of the list and tuple.

In conclusion, since the function accurately reflects the problem statement and produces the correct results for valid inputs, the correctness of the program is affirmed as **True**.
