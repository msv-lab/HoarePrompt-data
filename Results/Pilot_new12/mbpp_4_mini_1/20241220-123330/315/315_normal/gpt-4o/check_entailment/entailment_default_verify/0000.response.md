Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the function `func_1` is correct is accurate based on the provided problem description, program implementation, and output hints. The function properly concatenates a list with a tuple by converting the tuple into a list and returns a new combined list. The provided test cases validate this behavior. Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as empty inputs as expected, ensuring that it remains true to the problem description. The output hints support this functionality and confirm that it operates correctly for the described scenarios. Therefore, the conclusion of the original assessment is upheld.
