Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it successfully adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list. The use of `lst + list(tpl)` efficiently concatenates the list and the converted tuple, resulting in the correct output.

The provided test assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. Additionally, there are no edge cases, such as empty lists or tuples, that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. Here are a few additional considerations:

1. Adding an empty tuple to a list:
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 3], ()) == [1, 2, 3]
   ```
   This would still yield the original list.

2. Adding an empty list to a tuple:
   ```python
   assert func_1([], (1, 2)) == [1, 2]
   ```
   This case also returns the correct output.

Overall, based on the logic and the test cases provided, the function behaves correctly for all potential inputs within the context of the given problem description.
