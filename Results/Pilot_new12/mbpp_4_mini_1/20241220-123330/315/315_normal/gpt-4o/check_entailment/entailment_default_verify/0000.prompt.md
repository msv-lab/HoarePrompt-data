You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly concatenates a list with a tuple, converting the tuple to a list in the process. The provided test cases confirm that it works as expected for various input cases. Moreover, the program will handle edge cases, such as when the input list or tuple is empty. For example:

- If the list is empty and the tuple is `(1, 2)`, the function will return `[1, 2]`.
- If the tuple is empty and the list is `[3, 4]`, the function will return `[3, 4]`.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly and matches the problem description, it is considered accurate.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as parameters. It concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl`, which are first converted to a list, resulting in a new list containing all elements from both `lst` and `tpl`. The function does not modify the original list or tuple; instead, it returns a new list that combines these elements. Additionally, since `tpl` can be empty (an empty tuple), the function will simply return a copy of `lst` when provided with an empty tuple. Furthermore, the function does not check for other edge cases such as the types of elements in `lst` or `tpl`, and does not handle potential issues related to extremely large input sizes that may lead to memory errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
