Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. It successfully adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list without modifying the original list or tuple, fulfilling the requirements perfectly.

The provided test assertions support this, yielding the expected outputs when tested against various valid inputs. Furthermore, the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as when the tuple is empty, which results in returning a copy of the original list.

The output hints also summarize the function's behavior effectively, confirming that it concatenates the list and converted tuple elements correctly, and highlights that the function assumes valid input, which aligns with the assessment. There are no noted failures in functionality or logic within the defined constraints, solidifying the conclusion that the program is correct.
