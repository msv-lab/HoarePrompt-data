Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly performs the task of adding the elements from a given tuple to a given list. It successfully concatenates the list and the tuple after converting the tuple to a list using the `list(tpl)` method. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function handles the addition as expected, returning a new list with elements from both inputs without modifying the original list or tuple. 

The hints suggest that the function will correctly handle an empty tuple by returning a copy of the original list, which aligns with expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not need to handle any edge cases related to the types of elements in the inputs since the problem description assumes valid inputs. Overall, this program meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases provided.
