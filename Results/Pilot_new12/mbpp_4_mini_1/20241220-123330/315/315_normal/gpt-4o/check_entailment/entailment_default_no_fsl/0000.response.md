Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly fulfills the requirements described in the problem. It takes a list and a tuple as inputs, concatenates the contents of the tuple (converted to a list) to the list, and returns the resulting new list. 

The function behaves as follows for the example assertions:
- For the call `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, it returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
- For `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))`, it returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
- For `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))`, it returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Additionally, the function handles an empty tuple correctly by simply returning a copy of the input list when given an empty tuple, producing no errors.

While the function does not check for the types of the elements in the list or tuple, the problem description assumes valid inputs, so this does not affect correctness. There are no edge cases presented by the output hints that cause the function to fail.

Thus, since the function operates correctly under the described conditions and handles the given examples as expected, it is deemed correct for all potential cases based on the given assumptions.
