You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and tpl is a tuple of elements.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns the list lst concatenated with the elements of tuple tpl converted to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as parameters. It concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl`, which are first converted to a list, resulting in a new list containing all elements from both `lst` and `tpl`. The function does not modify the original list or tuple; instead, it returns a new list that combines these elements. Additionally, since `tpl` can be empty (an empty tuple), the function will simply return a copy of `lst` when provided with an empty tuple. Furthermore, the function does not check for other edge cases such as the types of elements in `lst` or `tpl`, and does not handle potential issues related to extremely large input sizes that may lead to memory errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
