Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly concatenates a list with a tuple, converting the tuple to a list in the process. The provided test cases confirm that it works as expected for various input cases. Moreover, the program will handle edge cases, such as when the input list or tuple is empty. For example:

- If the list is empty and the tuple is `(1, 2)`, the function will return `[1, 2]`.
- If the tuple is empty and the list is `[3, 4]`, the function will return `[3, 4]`.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly and matches the problem description, it is considered accurate.
