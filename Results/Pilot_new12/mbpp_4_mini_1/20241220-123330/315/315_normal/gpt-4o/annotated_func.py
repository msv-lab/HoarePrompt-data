#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and tpl is a tuple of elements.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns the list lst concatenated with the elements of tuple tpl converted to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as parameters. It concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl`, which are first converted to a list, resulting in a new list containing all elements from both `lst` and `tpl`. The function does not modify the original list or tuple; instead, it returns a new list that combines these elements. Additionally, since `tpl` can be empty (an empty tuple), the function will simply return a copy of `lst` when provided with an empty tuple. Furthermore, the function does not check for other edge cases such as the types of elements in `lst` or `tpl`, and does not handle potential issues related to extremely large input sizes that may lead to memory errors.
