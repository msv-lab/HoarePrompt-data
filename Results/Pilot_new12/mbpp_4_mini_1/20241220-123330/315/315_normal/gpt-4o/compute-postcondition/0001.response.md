The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `tpl` is a tuple of elements. After executing the function body, the function returns the list `lst` concatenated with the elements of tuple `tpl` converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of lst with the elements of tpl converted to a list.**
