Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and converts it to its string representation, `digit_str`.
2. It initializes an empty dictionary called `frequency` to keep track of how often each digit appears in `digit_str`.
3. The program iterates over each digit in `digit_str`, counting the occurrences of each digit and updating the `frequency` dictionary accordingly.
4. After constructing the `frequency` dictionary, the program then checks each digit's count against the integer value of the digit itself. Specifically, for each `(digit, count)` in `frequency.items()`, it verifies if the `count` is greater than the integer representation of `digit`.
5. If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the frequency criteria are met for all digits.

The program adheres to the problem description by accurately determining whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself for every valid input case we have reviewed (as shown by the assertions in the program). 

Thus, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the function does precisely what the problem description requires.
