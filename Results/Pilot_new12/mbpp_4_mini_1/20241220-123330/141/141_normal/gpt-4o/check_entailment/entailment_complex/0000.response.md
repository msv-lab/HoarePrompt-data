Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem, the function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the implementation incorrectly handles the special case when the input `n` is `0`.

In the case when `n` is `0`, the frequency dictionary ends up being `{"0": 1}`, because there is one occurrence of the digit `0`. The program then evaluates whether `1` (the frequency of `0`) is less than or equal to `0` (the digit value), which is false. Thus, the function returns `False`, which is not expected behavior because the prompt doesn't specify any constraints that would disallow zero.

The function should handle this case correctly according to the problem description. In the context of the requirements, it should return `True` for `0`, because the frequency (`1`) is indeed not allowed to exceed the digit's value (`0`). 

Therefore, the function is flawed in its implementation regarding how it treats the digit `0` and does not adhere to the problem description. Additionally, the assertion test with `func_1(51241)` implies that the function should return `False`, which is correct behavior. However, due to the incorrect handling of `0`, the overall correctness of the function does not align with the problem statement.

Hence, the program does not fulfill the conditions set out in the problem description for all potential cases.
