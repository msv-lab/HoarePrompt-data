Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a digit present in `digit_str`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that digit appears in `digit_str`. If `n` is 0, then `digit_str` is "0", and `frequency` is `{"0": 1}`.**
