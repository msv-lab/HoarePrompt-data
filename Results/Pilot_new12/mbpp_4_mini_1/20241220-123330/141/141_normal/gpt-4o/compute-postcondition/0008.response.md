According to the code, the for loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`, which is `digit_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` is processed character by character, and `digit` is currently the first character of `digit_str`. 

To execute one more time, the loop will proceed to the next character in the string. Thus, if `digit_str` has a length greater than the current index, it will continue executing. Assuming `digit_str` contains all characters of `n`, for the loop to execute again, `digit` must correspond to the next character in the string representation.

If `digit` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute one more time, it must check that `digit_str` contains more digits. Hence, `digit` will become the second character of `digit_str` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, digit is the second character of `digit_str`**
