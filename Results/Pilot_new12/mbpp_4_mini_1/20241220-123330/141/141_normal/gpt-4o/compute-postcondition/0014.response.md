Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we can determine the output state as follows:

The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key in the dictionary `frequency` that corresponds to the character `digit`. The variable `digit` represents the third character of `digit_str`, which is a string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. Since `digit_str` must have at least 3 characters, `digit` will always correspond to a character in the string that is derived from `n`. The initial state `n` and `digit_str` remain unchanged, as does any other variable not directly affected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that has at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit] = 1`.**
