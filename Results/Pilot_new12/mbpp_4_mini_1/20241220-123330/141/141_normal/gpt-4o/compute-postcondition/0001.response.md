The code initializes an empty dictionary called `frequency`, which does not affect the values or types of the previously defined variables. The variable `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `digit_str` continues to be a string representation of `n`. Therefore, the output state after executing the code reflects the following:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`; `frequency` is an empty dictionary.**
