According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `digit_str`. The execution of the loop itself relies on `digit_str` having at least one character. Given that `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure that `digit_str` can indeed represent a valid number.

1. **Check the value of `n`:** If `n` is 0, `digit_str` is the string "0", which allows for the loop to execute once.
2. **Check the structure of `digit_str`:** Since `digit_str` is derived from `n`, it will contain at least one character.

At the end of the last iteration (if applicable), we can assume that the loop would finish iterating through all the characters in `digit_str`.

So, in summary, for the loop to execute:

- `n` must be a non-negative integer (which ensures `digit_str` is not empty)
- The first character `digit` can be derived from `digit_str` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary states need to be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of n, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str**.
