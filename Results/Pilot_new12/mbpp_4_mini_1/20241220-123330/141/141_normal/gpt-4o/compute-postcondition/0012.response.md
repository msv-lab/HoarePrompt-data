According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `digit_str`. The variable `digit` represents the current character being processed in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` corresponds to the characters of the number `n` as a string, and `digit` is the second character in that string.

For the loop to execute one more time, it must process the next character in `digit_str`. Since the loop iterates through each character of `digit_str`, if `digit` is the second character, then the next value of `digit` will be the third character. The loop should continue as long as there are characters in `digit_str`.

Therefore, `digit_str` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute once more, and `digit` will then be the third character in the string for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least 3 characters, and `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`.**
