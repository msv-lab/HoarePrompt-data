Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then the count of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1. If `digit` is not in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.***
