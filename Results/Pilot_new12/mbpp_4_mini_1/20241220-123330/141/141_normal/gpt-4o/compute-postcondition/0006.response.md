The code assigns the value `1` to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. The previous values indicate that `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, which is a string representation of the non-negative integer `n`, and `digit` is not currently present in `frequency`. Therefore, after executing this code, `frequency` will have `digit` with a value of `1`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, and `frequency` now contains `digit` with a value of `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, `frequency[digit]` is 1.**
