`frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. The value of `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, which is derived from the non-negative integer `n`. Therefore, the `frequency` dictionary is now updated with the count of `digit` increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.**
