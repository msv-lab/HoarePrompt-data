Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines if the count of each digit in its string representation (`digit_str`) does not exceed the integer value of that digit. It constructs a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each digit appears. If any digit has a count greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`. If all digits satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`. Notably, the function specifically handles the case when `n` is 0, resulting in a frequency dictionary of `{"0": 1}`, which returns `False` as 1 is greater than the integer value of 0. The final state of the program indicates whether or not the digit count constraints were upheld.
