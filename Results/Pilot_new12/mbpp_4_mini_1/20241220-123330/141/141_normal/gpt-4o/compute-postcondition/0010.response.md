The code assigns the value 1 to `frequency[digit]`. The variable `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, which is a string representation of `n`. Therefore, `frequency[digit]` is set to 1, indicating that the digit represented by `digit` has a frequency of 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will embrace the valid information derived from the precondition and the modifications made by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, `frequency[digit]` is 1.**
