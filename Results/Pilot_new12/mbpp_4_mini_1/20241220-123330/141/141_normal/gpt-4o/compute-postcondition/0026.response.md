Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `frequency` must contain at least one more item. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If `count` is less than or equal to `digit`, the function does not return anything (None).***
