Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, where `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`. If `digit` is in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. If `digit` is not in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.***
