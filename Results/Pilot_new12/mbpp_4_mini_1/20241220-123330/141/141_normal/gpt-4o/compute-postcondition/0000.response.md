The value of `digit_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` will now hold a string that represents this non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.**
