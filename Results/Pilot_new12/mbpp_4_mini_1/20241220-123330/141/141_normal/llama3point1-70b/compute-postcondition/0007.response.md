Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` with at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character in `str_n`. If `str_n` contains more occurrences of `digit` than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If not, the function has no impact on the output.***
