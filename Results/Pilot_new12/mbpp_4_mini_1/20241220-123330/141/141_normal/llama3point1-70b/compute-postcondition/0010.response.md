Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, and the third character in `str_n` is `digit`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If the count of `digit` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, there is no return value.***
