According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `str_n`, which is the string representation of `n`. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must contain at least one character, which implies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The variable `digit` will represent each character in `str_n` during each iteration. 

Assuming `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is 0, `str_n` would be "0", and the loop would execute once. If `n` is any positive integer, `str_n` would contain multiple characters corresponding to each digit of `n`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we have to confirm that `str_n` is a valid string representation of `n` and has at least one character. At the start of the loop, `digit` should be the first character of `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n` that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n**
