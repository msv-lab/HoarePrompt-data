Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it works as intended:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n` and converts it to its string representation, allowing it to iterate through each digit.

2. **Frequency Check**: It uses a loop to go through each digit and checks the frequency of that digit in the string representation. The condition `if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):` ensures that if the count of a particular digit exceeds its integer value, the function returns `False`. 

3. **Return Value**: If the function iterates through all the digits without finding any that violate the condition, it returns `True`, confirming that the frequency of each digit is indeed less than or equal to the digit itself.

The program handles the task as specified by the problem description for all valid non-negative integer inputs. Thus, it adheres to the requirements laid out and is deemed correct.
