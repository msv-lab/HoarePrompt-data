Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for potential cases where the input may not be a valid non-negative integer, even though we assume valid input will be provided. Specifically, the program does not handle the case of single-digit integers properly when it comes to the digits' counts. 

For instance, given the number `111`, the program will count the digit `1` three times (which exceeds the integer value of `1`), and thus should return `False`. However, if we consider `222`, it can handle the count of `2` correctly as the count (2) is less than or equal to the digit itself (2), so it returns `True`.

A failing edge case is `121`, where the digit `1` appears twice (greater than its integer value of `1`), so the program should return `False`. However, if we consider `000` (though the problem implies it is non-negative, we can assume edge cases), the presence of three `0`s should also return `False`. 

Thus, the logic implemented does not correctly account for edge cases such as these, which demonstrates that the correctness criterion fails.
