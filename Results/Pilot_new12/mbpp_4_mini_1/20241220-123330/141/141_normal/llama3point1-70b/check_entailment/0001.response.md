To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its functionality in accordance with the problem description.

**Problem description**: The task is to check if the frequency of each digit in a given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

**Program code**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

**Explanation of the program**:
- The function first converts the integer `n` into its string representation `str_n`.
- It then iterates over each digit in the string representation.
- For each digit, it counts how many times that digit appears in the string (`str_n.count(digit)`).
- It checks if this count exceeds the value of the digit itself (converted back to an integer).

**Evaluation**:
1. Let's consider an example to see how it behaves:
   - For `n = 221`:
     - The digits are `2` and `1`.
     - The digit `2` appears `2` times (which is equal to `2`), so it passes.
     - The digit `1` appears `1` time (which is also equal to `1`), so it passes.
     - The function would return `True`.

2. Let's consider a failing case:
   - For `n = 333` (the digit `3` appears `3` times).
     - The digit `3` appears `3` times (which is equal to `3`), so it passes.
     - The function would return `True`.

3. Another potential edge case:
   - For `n = 1229`:
     - The digit `1` appears `1` time (passes).
     - The digit `2` appears `2` times (passes).
     - The digit `9` appears `1` time (fails because `1 > 9`).
     - The function would incorrectly identify this scenario.

After considering potential edge cases, I observed that the program incorrectly checks the digit `9` against its frequency, as `1` (the frequency of `9`) does not exceed `9`. 

As such, I realized that the function's check could fail in cases where the frequency of digits matches but does not account for digits having a frequency greater than the digits themselves when viewed individually.

Based on the analysis, I am concluding that the provided implementation does not cover all test cases satisfactorily.

Correctness: **False**
