Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single non-negative integer `n` as input, as specified in the problem description. It correctly converts `n` to its string representation `str_n` to facilitate digit manipulation.

2. **Digit Frequency Check**: The program iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it counts the occurrences of that digit using `str_n.count(digit)`. The condition checks if this count exceeds the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`). If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the frequency constraint is violated.

3. **Correct Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding any violations, the function returns `True`, confirming that all digit frequencies comply with the condition stated in the problem description.

4. **Problem Requirements**: The primary requirement from the problem is that for each digit in the integer, the frequency of that digit must be less than or equal to the digit itself. The program checks this condition explicitly for all digits in the numeric input and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the evaluations.

Thus, given the function's logic and adherence to the problem description, it is correct.
