The provided function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function does this by converting the integer into a string to iterate through each digit and counts the occurrences of each digit in the string.

Output hints indicate the function returns False if any digit has a count greater than its integer value, which is correct according to the provided problem description. The function also returns True if all digits meet the criteria, complying with the requirements.

However, the problem description does not limit the input solely to non-negative integers, yet the code does not handle negative integers correctly, as the logic is based on string representation. For instance, if the input is `-121`, the string representation would be `-121`, making the function's logic faulty for this case. 

Also, while the input is stated to be a non-negative integer, there is an implication that the function should explicitly handle the case where a negative integer could be passed, as the problem description doesn't rule out those possibilities. 

Given these points, the function does not conform to the problem description for every potential case, particularly regarding negative integers.

Correctness: **False**.
