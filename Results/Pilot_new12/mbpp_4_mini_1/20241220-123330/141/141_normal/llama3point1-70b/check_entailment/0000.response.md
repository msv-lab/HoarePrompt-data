To assess the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function with respect to various input cases.

**Problem description:** The function must check if the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

**Program Review:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

We can break down the function:
1. It first converts the integer `n` to a string representation `str_n`.
2. It then iterates over each unique character (digit) in the string.
3. It checks if the count of that digit in the string is greater than the integer value of that digit.
4. If any digitâ€™s count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Example 1: n = 122**  
   - Digits: 1 (1 time), 2 (2 times)  
   - 1 <= 1 (True), 2 <= 2 (True)  
   - Result: True (Correct)

2. **Example 2: n = 1122**  
   - Digits: 1 (2 times), 2 (2 times)  
   - 1 <= 2 (True), 2 <= 2 (True)  
   - Result: True (Correct)

3. **Example 3: n = 222**  
   - Digit: 2 (3 times)  
   - 2 > 2 (False)  
   - Result: False (Correct)

4. **Example 4: n = 333444**  
   - Digits: 3 (3 times), 4 (3 times)  
   - 3 <= 3 (True), 4 <= 3 (False)  
   - Result: False (Correct)

5. **Example 5: n = 0**  
   - Digit: 0 (1 time)  
   - 1 > 0 (False)  
   - Result: False (Correct)

### Boundary Cases:
6. **Example 6: n = 1000**  
   - Digits: 1 (1 time), 0 (3 times)  
   - 1 <= 1 (True), 3 > 0 (False)  
   - Result: False (Correct)

### Issue Identification:
The check `str_n.count(digit)` counts occurrences of each digit multiple times because it iterates over the string, leading to potential inefficiencies but does not inherently alter correctness. 

However, the function assumes every digit is unique based on its checks, which is incorrect because:
- If there are multiple instances of a digit (`digit` being the character representation), it should accurately represent the frequency without causing logical errors.

Thus, the implementation doesn't handle cases like `1000` where zero occurs more than possible within constraints. Also, when `digit = '0'`, the check fails incorrectly since zero digits can occur any number of times but must not count.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program is incorrect for situations such as `n = 1000` or leading zeros (if considered as valid input), the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**.
