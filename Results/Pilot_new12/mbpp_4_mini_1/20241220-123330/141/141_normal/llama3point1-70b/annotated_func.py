#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for each digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to its integer value.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that for each digit in the string representation of non-negative integer 'n', the count of that digit in 'str_n' is less than or equal to its integer value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. It checks the string representation of this integer to ensure that for each digit, the count of that digit in the string is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. If any digit has a count greater than its integer value, the function returns False. If all digits meet the criteria, the function returns True. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as it only operates on non-negative integers as specified in the precondition. Additionally, the function assumes the input is valid (i.e., it does not validate whether `n` is indeed a non-negative integer).
