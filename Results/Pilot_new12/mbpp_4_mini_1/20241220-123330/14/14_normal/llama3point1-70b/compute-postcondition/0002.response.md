Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`. It effectively checks for uniqueness of the elements in the list by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set created from the list. In the case where `arr` is empty, the function will return `False` since there are no duplicates in an empty list. Therefore, the function handles edge cases such as an empty list properly.**
