Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements, but there is a problem with the return value. The function correctly returns `True` if there are duplicates (i.e., when the lengths of the list and the set created from it are different), and `False` otherwise.

However, according to the problem description, it must indicate the presence of duplicates. This means that if there are duplicates, it should return `True` and if there are no duplicates, it should return `False`. But the current implementation returns `True` when there are duplicates and `False` when there are none, which is contrary to the expected behavior.

For example:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3]` â†’ Expected: `False` (no duplicates), Actual: `True` (incorrect result).
  
Thus, the logic does not align with the stated requirement of the problem.
