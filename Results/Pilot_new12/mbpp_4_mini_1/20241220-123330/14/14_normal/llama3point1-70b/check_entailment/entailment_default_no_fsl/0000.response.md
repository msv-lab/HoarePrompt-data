Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function that checks for duplicate elements in a list of integers. It uses a set to determine the uniqueness of the elements, which is an efficient approach. 

The use of `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` will return `True` if there are duplicates (since the set will remove duplicates and result in a shorter length) and `False` if all elements are unique. The program also correctly handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `False`, as there are no duplicates in an empty list.

There are no identified edge cases in the problem description that the program fails to address, and the output hints align with its functionality. Thus, it fulfills the requirements of the task.
