The provided program is designed to check for duplicates in a list of integers by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from that list. If there are duplicate elements, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original list, which will cause the function to return `True`. If all elements are unique (or if the list is empty), it will return `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function does return `True` if there are duplicates, and `False` if there are none or if the list is empty. The hints also correctly indicate that the function handles the edge case of an empty array, returning `False` because there cannot be duplicates in an empty list.

Since the function performs the intended operation correctly for all specified scenarios, including the valid handling of the empty list, it fulfills the problem description without omissions.

Correctness: **True**.
