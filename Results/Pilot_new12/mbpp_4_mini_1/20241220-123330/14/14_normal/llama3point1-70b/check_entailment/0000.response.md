Correctness: **True**.

The program checks if there are duplicate elements in the array by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set created from that list. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, if the lengths are different, it indicates the presence of duplicates in the array.

All potential cases are handled correctly, including:
- An empty array returns `False` (no duplicates).
- An array with all unique elements returns `False`.
- An array with any duplicates will correctly return `True`.

Thus, I cannot find any case where the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
