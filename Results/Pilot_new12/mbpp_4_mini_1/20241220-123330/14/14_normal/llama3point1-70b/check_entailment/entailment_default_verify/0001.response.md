The original assessment claims that the program's correctness is **False**. This reasoning is correct because the implementation returns `True` for the presence of duplicate elements and `False` when there are none, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. According to the problem description, the function must return `True` if duplicates are present and `False` if they are not.

The output hints clarify that the function is designed to identify duplicates correctly; however, the return values are inverted. Thus, if we take an example such as `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, the expected output is `False` (indicating no duplicates), but the function returns `True`. This discrepancy confirms that the function does not meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment indeed makes sense as it accurately reflects the discrepancy between the expected behavior based on the problem description and the actual behavior of the program.

Final: **False**
