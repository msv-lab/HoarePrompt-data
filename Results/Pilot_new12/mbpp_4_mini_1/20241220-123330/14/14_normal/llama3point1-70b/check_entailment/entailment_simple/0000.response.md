Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It is intended to determine if an array contains any duplicate elements, returning `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not. However, the implementation of the function `func_1(arr)` uses the expression `len(arr) != len(set(arr))`, which will return `True` when there are duplicates, indicating the presence of duplicates. This behavior is opposite to what is typically expected; when duplicates are found, the function should logically return `True`, but the mapping of output to requirements is flawed. 

To clarify:
- The function should return `True` if there are duplicates (as the problem states).
- In its current implementation, the function returns `True` when duplicates are present and `False` when there are none, which misaligns it with the expected output unless specifically defined as such.

Therefore, the implementation does not consistently do what the problem description indicates in terms of output interpretation, which is why it is considered incorrect.
