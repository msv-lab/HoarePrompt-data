Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirement of the problem description correctly. According to the problem description, the function must find whether the given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. However, the function `func_1` returns `True` when duplicates are found and `False` when there are no duplicates. It effectively does the opposite of what is required. 

The correct behavior should be to return `True` if duplicates exist and `False` if they do not. Therefore, for the input list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `False`, indicating no duplicates, but it incorrectly returns `True` instead. 

Thus, the logic implemented in the program does not align with the stated problem requirement.
