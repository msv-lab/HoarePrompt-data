The original assessment indicated that the correctness of the program was **False** because it incorrectly claimed that the function would return `True` when duplicates were present, which contradicts the problem description.

Let's analyze the annotated version of the code carefully:

1. **Understanding the Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as input.
   - It calculates the length of `arr` and compares it to the length of the set created from `arr`. A set inherently only contains unique elements, so if there are duplicates in `arr`, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `True` if the lengths are not equal (`len(arr) != len(set(arr))`), which implies that there are duplicates because the set reduced the number of elements.
   - Conversely, it returns `False` if there are no duplicates because the lengths will be equal.

3. **Alignment with Problem Description**:
   - The problem description asks for a function that checks for duplicate integers, requiring it to return `True` if duplicates exist and `False` if they do not.
   - Given how the function operates, it implements the requirement correctly by returning `True` when duplicates are present and `False` otherwise.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations clearly state that the program's return is dependent on the presence of duplicates, confirming that the provided logic is accurate and does align with the problem description.

Given this analysis, the original assessment that marked the correctness as **False** is flawed. The function does indeed fulfill the requirements of the problem description, returning the correct boolean indicative of whether duplicates exist.

Final: **True**
