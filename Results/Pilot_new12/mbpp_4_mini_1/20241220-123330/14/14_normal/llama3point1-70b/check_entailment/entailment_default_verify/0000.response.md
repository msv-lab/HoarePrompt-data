Based on the provided problem description, the program's functionality, and the output hints, the initial assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.

The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given list of integers contains duplicates by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from that list. Since sets inherently do not allow duplicate elements, a discrepancy in the lengths indicates the presence of duplicates.

The output hints confirm that the function operates as intended:
- It returns `False` for an empty list (no elements means no duplicates).
- It reliably returns `False` for lists with all unique elements.
- It returns `True` for lists containing any duplicates.

Moreover, the edge cases have been handled properly, as indicated in the output hints. The assumption that the input will be a valid list of integers supports the correctness of the program as written. There are no contradictions or indications in the problem description or the hints that suggest the function fails to meet the specified requirements.

Thus, after thorough analysis and validation against the problem description, the program functions correctly.

Final: **True**
