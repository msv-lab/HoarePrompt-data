#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`, and the loop executes until either a duplicate integer is found or all integers in `arr` have been processed. If a duplicate is found, the loop terminates early and `seen` includes all integers that have been seen up to that point. If the loop executes fully, then all integers in `arr` were unique.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that either a duplicate integer was found in 'arr' or all integers in 'arr' were unique without duplicates encountered during processing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It checks for the presence of duplicate integers in the list. The function iterates through each integer in `arr`, maintaining a set called `seen` to track unique integers encountered so far. If a duplicate is detected (an integer that already exists in the `seen` set), it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. The function handles both cases where the input list is empty (returning `False`) and cases with negative integers or zeros. In summary, the function concludes with either `True` if a duplicate is found or `False` if all integers are unique. The annotations regarding the conditions under which it returns True or False mostly align with the code's behavior, but they could benefit from clearer explanations of processing an empty list and always returning False when no duplicates are found.
