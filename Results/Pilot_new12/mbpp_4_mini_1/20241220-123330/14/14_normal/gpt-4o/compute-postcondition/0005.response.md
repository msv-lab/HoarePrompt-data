The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since we know that `num` is the first integer in the `arr` list and is not currently in `seen`, after execution, `seen` will contain `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is not in `seen` before the execution of the code.**
