According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `arr` list. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer. At the end of the last iteration, the state does not influence the loop's ability to start. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must have at least one integer, and `num` must be the first integer in the `arr` list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in the `arr` list**
