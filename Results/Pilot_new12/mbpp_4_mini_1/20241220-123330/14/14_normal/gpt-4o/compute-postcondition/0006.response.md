According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the array `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers, the loop will execute for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least 1 integer, `seen` contains `num`, and `num` is the first integer in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be updated to the second integer in the array.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the second integer in `arr`**
