Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`, and the loop executes until either a duplicate integer is found or all integers in `arr` have been processed. If a duplicate is found, the loop terminates early and `seen` includes all integers that have been seen up to that point. If the loop executes fully, then all integers in `arr` were unique.**
