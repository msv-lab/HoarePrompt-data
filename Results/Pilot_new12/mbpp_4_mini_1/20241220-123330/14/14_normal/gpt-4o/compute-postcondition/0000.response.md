The code `seen = set()` initializes the variable `seen` as a new empty set. The initial state specified that `arr` is a list of integers, which remains unaffected by this operation. Consequently, the output state reflects that the `arr` variable remains as a list of integers, while `seen` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is an empty set**
