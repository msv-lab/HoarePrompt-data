`seen` is updated to include `num`, which is the third integer in `arr`. This means that `num` is now part of the `seen` set. The other variables remain unchanged, and since the return statement has been executed previously, it can have no effect after executing this line. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `seen` now includes `num`, and `num` is the third integer in `arr`.**
