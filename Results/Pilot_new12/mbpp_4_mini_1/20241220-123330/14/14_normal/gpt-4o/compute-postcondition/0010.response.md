According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `num` will now be the third integer in the `arr`, and we will also increment the `seen` set accordingly.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the third integer in `arr`**
