The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function can return in different scenarios: 

- In Case 1, it returns `True`, indicating that the current value of 'num' is in the set 'seen'.
- In Case 2, it returns `True`.
- In Case 3, it returns `True`.
- In Case 4, it returns `False`, indicating that either a duplicate integer was found in 'arr' or all integers in 'arr' were unique without duplicates encountered during processing.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and provide a Boolean output that reflects whether duplicates were found or if the set contains specific values based on the processing of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns True in certain cases if specific conditions are met, or False if a duplicate is found or all integers in arr are unique.**
