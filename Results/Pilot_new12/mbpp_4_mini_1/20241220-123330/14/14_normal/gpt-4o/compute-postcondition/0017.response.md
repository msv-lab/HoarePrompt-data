Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It checks for the presence of duplicate integers in the list. The function iterates through each integer in `arr`, maintaining a set called `seen` to track unique integers encountered so far. If a duplicate is detected (an integer that already exists in the `seen` set), it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. The function handles both cases where the input list is empty (returning `False`) and cases with negative integers or zeros. In summary, the function concludes with either `True` if a duplicate is found or `False` if all integers are unique. The annotations regarding the conditions under which it returns True or False mostly align with the code's behavior, but they could benefit from clearer explanations of processing an empty list and always returning False when no duplicates are found.**
