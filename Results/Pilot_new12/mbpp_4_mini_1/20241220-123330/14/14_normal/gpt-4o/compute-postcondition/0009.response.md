`seen` is updated by adding `num` to the set. The initial state indicates that `num` is the second integer in `arr` and that `seen` already contains `num` or may not. The function does not return a value after executing this line, but `seen` now includes `num` if it wasn't already there. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and `num` is now added to `seen`.**
