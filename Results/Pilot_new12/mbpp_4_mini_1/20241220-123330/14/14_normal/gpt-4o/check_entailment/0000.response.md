Correctness: **True**. 

The provided function `func_1` accurately detects duplicate elements in an array of integers. It does so by utilizing a set to track seen numbers. As it iterates through the array:

- If a number is found in the set, it returns `True`, indicating a duplicate.
- If no duplicates are found by the end of the iteration, it returns `False`.

The assertions given also correctly reflect the expected results for various test cases, verifying the function's behavior. All potential input cases, including empty arrays and arrays with unique elements, are handled appropriately. Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
