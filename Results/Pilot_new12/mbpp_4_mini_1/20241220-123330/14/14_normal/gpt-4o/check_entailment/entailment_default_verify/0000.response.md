Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly fulfills the problem description by detecting duplicates in an array of integers. The logic of the function effectively uses a set to track encountered integers, allowing it to return `True` immediately upon detecting a duplicate or `False` if no duplicates exist after examining all elements. 

The output hints clarify that the function can handle various input scenarios, including empty lists and both positive and negative integers, indicating comprehensive coverage of the problem's requirements. Therefore, given that all assertions align with the expected behavior and the function operates correctly based on the outlined logic, the assessment of correctness remains justifiable.
