Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires finding whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements.

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as specified, and it will properly process this input since it assumes valid input.

2. **Logic to Detect Duplicates**:
   - It initializes an empty set called `seen`.
   - It iterates through each number in the input list `arr`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current number (`num`) is already in the `seen` set:
     - If it is found in `seen`, this indicates that a duplicate exists, and the function correctly returns `True`.
     - If it is not found, the number is added to the `seen` set, which keeps track of all unique numbers encountered so far.
  
3. **Final Return**: After checking all numbers in the list, if no duplicates were found, the function returns `False`, indicating that all elements were unique.

4. **Edge Cases**: It inherently handles various cases:
   - An array with all unique elements will correctly return `False`.
   - An array with duplicates will return `True`.
   - The implementation ensures that all integers are checked, and hence it satisfies the requirements regardless of the order or frequency of elements.

Overall, the function processes input efficiently and returns results aligned with the problem statement, confirming that the implementation meets the desired goal of detecting duplicates in a list of integers.
