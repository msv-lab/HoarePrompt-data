Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to check for duplicate integers in a list. It correctly operates under the outlined problem description, effectively checking for duplicates through the use of a set to track seen numbers. The assertions provided confirm that the implementation works for a variety of test cases, including unique numbers, duplicates, and cases with repeated numbers.

The function also handles edge cases:
1. An empty list, which correctly returns `False` (no duplicates).
2. Lists with negative integers or zeros, which are also handled appropriately as they can be added to a set without issue.

Since all the described functionality and edge cases align with the problem statement, the function is validated to operate correctly in all potential scenarios outlined.
