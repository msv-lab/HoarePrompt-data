Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements functionality to determine if there are any duplicate integers in a provided array, as stated in the problem description. The assertions provided represent various test cases confirming that the function behaves correctly under the given conditions. In particular, the annotations detail the functionâ€™s logic effectively, illustrating that it maintains a set of seen integers and returns `True` when a duplicate is encountered, or `False` otherwise.

The annotations also clarify that the program efficiently handles different scenarios, including empty input lists, by returning `False`, which satisfies the specified behavior. Additionally, the reasoning provided in the original assessment incorporates these essential features of the program, affirming its correctness in detecting duplicates and adhering to the problem specifications. Thus, the function meets the requirements established in the problem description, and no discrepancies arise when evaluated against the annotated version of the code.
