You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`, and the loop executes until either a duplicate integer is found or all integers in `arr` have been processed. If a duplicate is found, the loop terminates early and `seen` includes all integers that have been seen up to that point. If the loop executes fully, then all integers in `arr` were unique.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that either a duplicate integer was found in 'arr' or all integers in 'arr' were unique without duplicates encountered during processing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It checks for the presence of duplicate integers in the list. The function iterates through each integer in `arr`, maintaining a set called `seen` to track unique integers encountered so far. If a duplicate is detected (an integer that already exists in the `seen` set), it immediately returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. The function handles both cases where the input list is empty (returning `False`) and cases with negative integers or zeros. In summary, the function concludes with either `True` if a duplicate is found or `False` if all integers are unique. The annotations regarding the conditions under which it returns True or False mostly align with the code's behavior, but they could benefit from clearer explanations of processing an empty list and always returning False when no duplicates are found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
