Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check for duplicate elements in an array of integers. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the unique elements encountered in the array.
2. It iterates over each number in the input array `arr`.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number (`num`) is already present in the `seen` set.
   - If it is, this means a duplicate is found, and it immediately returns `True`.
   - If it isn't, it adds the number to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

This algorithm is efficient and works correctly for the given problem description, as the checks for duplicates function as intended.

The assertions at the beginning confirm that:
- An array with all unique elements returns `False`.
- An array with at least one duplicate returns `True`.
- An array with multiple duplicates still returns `True`.

No potential edge cases have been overlooked, and it handles empty arrays correctly, returning `False`, since an empty array has no duplicates. Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
