Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function efficiently checks for duplicate integers in an array and provides correct outputs as indicated by the assertions provided. 

The reasoning behind the correctness is reinforced by the output hints, which accurately summarize the function's logic: initializing a set to track seen integers, iterating through the input list, and returning `True` upon finding a duplicate or `False` if no duplicates are found after the complete iteration.

Additionally, the function correctly handles edge cases, such as empty lists, by returning `False`, which is aligned with the expectations set in the problem description. 

Given the clarity in the assertions and the accurate logic in the implementation, the final assessment remains accurate as the code fulfills the stated purpose of identifying duplicates in an array.
