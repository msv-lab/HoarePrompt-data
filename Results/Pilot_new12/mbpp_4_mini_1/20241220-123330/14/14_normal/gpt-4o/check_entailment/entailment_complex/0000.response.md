Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The purpose of the function `func_1` is to check whether a given list of integers, `arr`, contains any duplicate elements.

2. **Implementation Logic**: 
   - The function uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the integers that have been encountered as it iterates through the list `arr`.
   - For each integer `num` in the list, it checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set.
     - If `num` is found in `seen`, this indicates a duplicate, and the function immediately returns `True`.
     - If `num` is not found, it adds `num` to the `seen` set and continues checking the rest of the list.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates (i.e., if there are no repeated integers), the function returns `False`.

3. **Correctness in Edge Cases**: 
   - The implementation effectively handles cases where the list is empty by default since an empty list will not trigger the loop and will simply return `False`.
   - The logic properly considers negative integers and zeros as valid input since it does not make any assumptions about the value of the integers.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions serve as test cases, confirming that:
   - When input is a list of unique integers (like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), the function returns `False`.
   - When input contains duplicates (like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` and `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`), the function correctly returns `True`.

In conclusion, the function adheres strictly to the problem description, guaranteeing that it will identify duplicates correctly in the list of integers and return the appropriate boolean value.
