#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r, which is equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and phi, which is equal to math.atan2(y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns their polar coordinates `r` and `phi`, where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (`sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`), and `phi` is the angle formed with the positive x-axis, calculated using the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` (`math.atan2(y, x)`). The function does not handle cases where `x` and `y` are both zero, but it successfully computes the polar coordinates for all other real values.
