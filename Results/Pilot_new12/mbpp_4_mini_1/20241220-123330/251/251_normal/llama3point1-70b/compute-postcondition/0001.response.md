The variable `phi` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle whose tangent is the quotient of the two specified numbers (y/x) and returns the angle in radians. The values of `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, so `phi` will be the angle in radians corresponding to those coordinates. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is defined as `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2); `phi` is equal to math.atan2(y, x)**.
