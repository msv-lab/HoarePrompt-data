The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it calculates `r`, which is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `phi`, which is equal to the arctangent of the ratio of `y` to `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers, `x` and `y`, and return their polar coordinates `r` and `phi`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns their polar coordinates r and phi.**
