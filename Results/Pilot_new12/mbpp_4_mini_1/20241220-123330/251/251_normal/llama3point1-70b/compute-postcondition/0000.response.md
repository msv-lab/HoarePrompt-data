`r` is assigned the value of `math.hypot(x, y)`, which calculates the Euclidean norm (or distance) from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in a 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The specific value of `r` will depend on the previous values of `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and `r` is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2).**
