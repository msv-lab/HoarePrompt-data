Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, Ï†). It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius \( r \), which is the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and handles all cases since it computes the hypotenuse (\( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)). The angle \( \phi \) is computed with `math.atan2(y, x)`, which accurately determines the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). It correctly handles all quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system and edge cases such as when x and y are both zero. Thus, the function adheres to the problem description in all potential scenarios.
