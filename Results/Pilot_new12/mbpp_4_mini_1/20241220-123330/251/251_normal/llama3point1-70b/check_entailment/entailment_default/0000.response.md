Explanation: The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) using the formulas for r and φ. The use of `math.hypot` correctly computes the distance from the origin, and `math.atan2` accurately calculates the angle, handling the quadrant information based on the signs of x and y. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the case where both x and y are zero, which would result in an undefined angle. For instance, calling `func_1(0, 0)` is problematic because it does not specify how to handle this specific case, leading to an ambiguity in the polar coordinates, as the radius would be zero and the angle undefined. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
