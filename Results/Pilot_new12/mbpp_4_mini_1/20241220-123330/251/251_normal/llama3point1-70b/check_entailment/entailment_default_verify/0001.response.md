Final: **False**

The original assessment claiming the program is correct fails to acknowledge that the function does not handle the special case where both `x` and `y` are zero. According to the output hints, the function `func_1` will encounter an issue in such a scenario, as `math.atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. Although the problem description states that the function should convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, it is critical to handle all edge cases, including when both coordinates are zero. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirements completely, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment is inaccurate.
