Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, φ). It employs `math.hypot` to correctly compute the radius \( r \), which is defined as the distance from the point (x, y) to the origin, achieving this through the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Additionally, the function uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to find the angle \( φ \) in radians, appropriately handling all quadrants of the Cartesian plane. 

While the output hints indicate that the function does not specifically handle the case of both `x` and `y` being zero (resulting in ambiguous behavior for the angle), the mathematical functions used will return meaningful values for almost all other cases. Thus, based on the description and intended behavior of the program to convert coordinates, the original assessment of correctness remains justified.
