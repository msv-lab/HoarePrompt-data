Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why it meets the requirements of the problem description:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates.
2. It calculates `r`, the radial coordinate, using `math.hypot(x, y)`. This function computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
3. It calculates `phi`, the angular coordinate, using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This function computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y).
4. Finally, it returns both `r` and `phi` as a tuple.

Since the program follows the mathematical definitions for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, phi) accurately and does not have any exceptional cases that would violate the problem statement, we can conclude that it is correct.
