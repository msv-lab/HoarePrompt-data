Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). The `math.hypot(x, y)` function computes the distance r from the origin to the point (x, y), and the `math.atan2(y, x)` function computes the angle phi in radians, accounting for the signs of both x and y, which ensures it is correctly oriented in all quadrants.

Additionally, since both functions handle edge cases (such as x = 0 and y = 0) appropriately, I can't think of a potential case where the program would not perform as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the code correctly implements the required functionality for all inputs.
