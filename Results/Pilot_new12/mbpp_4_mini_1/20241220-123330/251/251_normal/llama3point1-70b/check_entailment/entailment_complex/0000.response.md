Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†) according to the provided problem description. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Rectangular to Polar Conversion**: The function takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It utilizes the following mathematical conventions:
   - The radial coordinate `r` is computed using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which internally calculates `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.
   - The angular coordinate `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which determines the angle in radians of the point (x, y) relative to the positive x-axis.

2. **Expected Outputs**: The function returns a tuple containing `r` and `phi`, which aligns perfectly with the specifications of the problem statement.

3. **Handled Cases**: While it does not explicitly manage the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, the problem description assumes valid inputs, thus positioning `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` to handle those scenarios appropriately by returning (0, 0) for (0, 0).

In summary, since the program adheres to the requirements of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates seamlessly while assuming valid inputs, it satisfactorily fulfills the problem description.
