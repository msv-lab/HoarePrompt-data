#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns r, which is the non-negative real number equal to the square root of (x squared + y squared), and theta, which is equal to math.atan2(y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional space. It calculates two values: `r`, which is the non-negative real number representing the distance from the origin to the point (calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`), and `theta`, which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated as the arctangent of `y/x`). The function ultimately returns the tuple `(r, theta)`. This functionality is valid for all real numbers `x` and `y`, including edge cases where `x` and `y` are both zero, resulting in `r` being zero and `theta` being zero. The code effectively performs all stated actions in the annotations, and there are no missing functionalities.
