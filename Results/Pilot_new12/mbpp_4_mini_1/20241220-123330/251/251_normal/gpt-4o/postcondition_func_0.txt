The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional space. It calculates two values: `r`, which is the non-negative real number representing the distance from the origin to the point (calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`), and `theta`, which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated as the arctangent of `y/x`). The function ultimately returns the tuple `(r, theta)`. This functionality is valid for all real numbers `x` and `y`, including edge cases where `x` and `y` are both zero, resulting in `r` being zero and `theta` being zero. The code effectively performs all stated actions in the annotations, and there are no missing functionalities.
