The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `r`, which is a non-negative real number equal to the square root of (x squared + y squared), and `theta`, which is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return their polar coordinates in the form of `r` and `theta`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, and returns r, the non-negative real number equal to the square root of (x squared + y squared), and theta, equal to math.atan2(y, x).**
