The variable `r` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are real numbers, `x ** 2` and `y ** 2` will yield non-negative results. Therefore, `r` will be a non-negative real number representing the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y) in the coordinate system. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is a non-negative real number equal to the square root of (`x` squared + `y` squared).**
