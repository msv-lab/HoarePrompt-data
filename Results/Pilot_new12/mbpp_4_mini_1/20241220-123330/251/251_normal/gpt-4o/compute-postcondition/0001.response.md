The variable `theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the point given by the coordinates (x, y). The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and since `r` is defined as the square root of (`x` squared + `y` squared) and is non-negative, it retains its meaning but is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the new calculated value for `theta`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is a non-negative real number equal to the square root of (`x` squared + `y` squared); `theta` is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)`.**
