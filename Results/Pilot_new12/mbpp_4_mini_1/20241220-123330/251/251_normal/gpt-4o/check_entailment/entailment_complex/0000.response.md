Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Hereâ€™s how the function `func_1` adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Correct Calculations**: The function correctly computes the polar coordinates using the formulas:
   - The radial coordinate \( r \) is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the rectangular coordinates \( x \) and \( y \): \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
   - The angular coordinate \( \theta \) is computed using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which handles the calculation of the angle in a way that correctly determines the angle based on the signs of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Output Format**: The function returns a tuple \( (r, \theta) \), ensuring that the output format aligns with the expectations defined in the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles various edge cases, including:
   - When both \( x \) and \( y \) are zero, it appropriately returns \( r = 0 \) and \( \theta = 0 \), which is consistent with the definition of polar coordinates at the origin.

4. **Valid Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases to confirm that the function works correctly for specific pairs of rectangular coordinates. These outputs validate the functionality as specified.

Overall, the function `func_1` successfully implements the required conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates and behaves as expected for all real values, adhering perfectly to the problem description.
