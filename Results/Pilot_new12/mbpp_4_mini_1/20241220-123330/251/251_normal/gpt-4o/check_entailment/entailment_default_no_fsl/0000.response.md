Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates according to the problem description. 

1. The `func_1` function calculates `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin, which is accurately computed using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.
2. It calculates `theta` as the angle in radians using `atan2(y, x)`, which correctly takes into account the signs and values of `x` and `y` to determine the angle in the correct quadrant.
3. The assertions provided in the code verify that the function returns the expected outputs for the given inputs, which represent common cases.
4. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases, including when both `x` and `y` are zero, resulting in a polar coordinate of `(0, 0)`.

Since the program meets all requirements of the problem description and handles various cases correctly, it is deemed correct for every potential input.
