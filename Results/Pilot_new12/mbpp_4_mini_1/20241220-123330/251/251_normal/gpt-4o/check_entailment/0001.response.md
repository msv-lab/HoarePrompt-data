Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The calculations for both r and θ are done using the appropriate mathematical formulas:

1. `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which gives the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
2. `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin and the point (x, y).

The assertions provided in the program test the function with specific (x, y) values, and they return the expected polar coordinates (r, θ). The function handles various quadrants correctly due to the use of `atan2`, which considers the signs of both x and y to determine the correct angle.

Upon reviewing the program, no edge cases are missed, and it behaves correctly for all cases based on the given problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
