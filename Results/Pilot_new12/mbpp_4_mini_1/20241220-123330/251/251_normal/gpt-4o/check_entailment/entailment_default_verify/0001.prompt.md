You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The calculations for both r and θ are done using the appropriate mathematical formulas:

1. `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which gives the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
2. `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin and the point (x, y).

The assertions provided in the program test the function with specific (x, y) values, and they return the expected polar coordinates (r, θ). The function handles various quadrants correctly due to the use of `atan2`, which considers the signs of both x and y to determine the correct angle.

Upon reviewing the program, no edge cases are missed, and it behaves correctly for all cases based on the given problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional space. It calculates two values: `r`, which is the non-negative real number representing the distance from the origin to the point (calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`), and `theta`, which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated as the arctangent of `y/x`). The function ultimately returns the tuple `(r, theta)`. This functionality is valid for all real numbers `x` and `y`, including edge cases where `x` and `y` are both zero, resulting in `r` being zero and `theta` being zero. The code effectively performs all stated actions in the annotations, and there are no missing functionalities.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
