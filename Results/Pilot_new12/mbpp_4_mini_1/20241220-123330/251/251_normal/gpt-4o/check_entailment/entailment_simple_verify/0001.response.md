Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` uses the appropriate mathematical formulas, with annotations confirming that `r` is calculated as the non-negative real number representing the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and `theta` represents the angle in radians.

The assertions provided test the function against specific cases and return the expected results, indicating the function behaves as expected. Additionally, the annotations align with this functionality, specifying the input as real numbers representing rectangular coordinates and confirming the outputs as valid polar coordinates.

The reasoning in the original assessment remains accurate because all defined test cases work correctly, and all edge cases regarding input assumptions are accounted for. Therefore, the program is concluded to be correct based on the definitions provided.
