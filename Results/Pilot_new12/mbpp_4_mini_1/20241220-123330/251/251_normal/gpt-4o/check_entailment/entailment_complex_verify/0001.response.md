Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately concludes that the program is correct. The function `func_1` successfully converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates by calculating the distance `r` using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using the `atan2` function. 

The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected at various stages:
- The inputs `x` and `y` are indeed treated as real numbers, and the calculation of `r` and `theta` follows the correct mathematical principles for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates.
- The assertions provided validate the expected outputs for specific test cases, confirming that the function produces the correct tuple of `(r, theta)`.

Since the annotations indicate the function handles all given inputs properly, including edge cases like `(0, 0)`, and does not omit any necessary functionality, the original assessment remains correct. The program meets the problem description, and there are no discrepancies or shortcomings in the provided logic.
