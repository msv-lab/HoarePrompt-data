Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta). It first calculates the radius r using the Pythagorean theorem and then calculates the angle theta using the `math.atan2` function, which correctly accounts for the signs of x and y to determine the correct quadrant for theta. The assertions provided test the function with specific examples, all of which return the expected results, confirming that it works for those inputs. Additionally, the program handles all cases given the behavior of the mathematical functions used, and no edge cases are left unaddressed based on the problem description.
