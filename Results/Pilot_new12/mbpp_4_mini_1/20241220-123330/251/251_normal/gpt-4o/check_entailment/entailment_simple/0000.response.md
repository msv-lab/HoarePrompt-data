Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Distance Calculation (r)**: The program calculates r as the square root of the sum of the squares of x and y, which is the correct formula for finding the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in rectangular coordinates. This follows the definition of polar coordinates where r represents the distance.

2. **Angle Calculation (θ)**: The program calculates θ using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This is the complete and correct method for determining the angle in polar coordinates since it takes into account the signs of both x and y to place the angle in the correct quadrant.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing the calculated values of r and θ, complying with the expected output format.

The assertions at the beginning test the function with specific known values, indicating that the calculations are expected to return the correct results for the provided rectangular coordinates.

Since it correctly computes both r and θ according to the definitions in the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
