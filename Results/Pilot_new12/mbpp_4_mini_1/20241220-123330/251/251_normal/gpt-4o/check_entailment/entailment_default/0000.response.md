The provided Python program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta). The function calculates the radius `r` as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and calculates the angle `theta` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles all quadrants properly, including the case when `x` is zero. 

The output hints explain that `theta` is calculated using the arctangent of `y/x`, which is relevant for determining the angle in polar coordinates. The program appears to handle the case where both `x` and `y` are zero. In this case, `r` will equal 0, and `theta` will also return 0, which is consistent with the polar coordinate representation of the origin. 

There are no indications in the problem description or output hints that suggest any edge cases are mishandled or that the code is missing any required functionality. Therefore, since the program operates correctly across all potential cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
