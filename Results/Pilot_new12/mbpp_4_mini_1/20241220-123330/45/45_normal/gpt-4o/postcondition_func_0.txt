The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and first checks if its string representation `s` is at least 3 characters long. If not, it returns `False`. If the first two characters of `s` are the same, it also returns `False`. Then, the function verifies if the characters in `s` alternate between the first and second characters for all subsequent indices. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the alternating pattern is valid; otherwise, it returns `False`. Thus, the function validates the structure of `n` based on its digit composition, primarily focusing on length, distinctiveness, and alternating patterns.
