According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `len(s)`. The loop will execute for a range of indices starting from 2 up to `len(s) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `len(s)` must be greater than or equal to 3 (which it currently is, as per the given condition). 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized at 2, and it will increment until it reaches `len(s) - 1`. Also, the variables `first_digit` and `second_digit` provide additional context but do not affect the loop execution directly.

In summary, the necessary adjustments to the states can be phrased as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2**
