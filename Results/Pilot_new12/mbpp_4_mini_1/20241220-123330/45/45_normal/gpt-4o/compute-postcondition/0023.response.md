Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with length at least 5, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is 4 (which is even) and `s[4]` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. If `s[4]` is equal to `first_digit`, the function does not return anything.***
