The code assigns the value of `s[1]` to `second_digit`, which means `second_digit` will hold the second character of the string representation of `n`. Given that `s` has a length of at least 3, `s[1]` is guaranteed to be a valid character.

The previous states of the relevant variables remain unchanged except for `second_digit`, which is now assigned the value of `s[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, and `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
