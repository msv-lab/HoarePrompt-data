The code assigns the value of the first character of the string `s` (which is a representation of the non-negative integer `n`) to the variable `first_digit`. The value of `first_digit` will be the first character of the string `s`, which corresponds to the first digit of the integer `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but I will include their previous information.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s` (i.e., the first digit of `n`.**
