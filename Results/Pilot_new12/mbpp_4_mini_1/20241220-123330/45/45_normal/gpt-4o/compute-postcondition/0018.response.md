Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with length greater than 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 3 and is odd, and `s[i]` is equal to either `first_digit` or `second_digit`. If `i` were even and `s[i]` was not equal to `first_digit`, the function would return False. Since `i` is actually odd, this condition doesn't hold and the program proceeds without an else block.***
