Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with length greater than 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and `i` is 3 which is odd. Since `s[i]` is equal to either `first_digit` or `second_digit`, if `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function would return False, but since the condition does not hold, the function proceeds without returning False.***
