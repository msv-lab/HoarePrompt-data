`n` is a non-negative integer. `s` is assigned the string representation of `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`**
