The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function contains several cases that lead to different return values. In Cases 1 through 8, the function returns `False`, indicating that specific conditions are not met based on the code logic. In Case 9, the function returns `True`, confirming that the alternating pattern of characters in string 's' holds for the given non-negative integer `n`, provided that the length of 's' is at least 3 and the first two characters are distinct. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and verify certain conditions on a string `s`, returning `True` or `False` based on those conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` for various conditions while returning `True` if an alternating character pattern condition is met in string `s`, with length at least 3 and distinct first two characters.**
