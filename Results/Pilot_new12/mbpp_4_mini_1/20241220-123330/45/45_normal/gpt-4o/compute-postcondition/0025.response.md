Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string with at least 5 characters, and `first_digit` is the first character while `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, where `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False; otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
