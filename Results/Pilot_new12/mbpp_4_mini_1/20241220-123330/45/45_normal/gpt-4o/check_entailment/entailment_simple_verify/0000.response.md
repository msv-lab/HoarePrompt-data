Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program `func_1` does not conform to the problem description's requirements for an undulating number. The key flaw in the implementation is that it allows numbers with more than two unique digits to be incorrectly classified as undulating. 

The annotations confirm that the function checks the length and the first two digits correctly but fail to mention that if the string has more than two different digits, the function can still return `True` if the first two digits alternate appropriately. This means that cases like `123123` are incorrectly considered undulating.

Thus, the assessment remains accurate: the program does not fulfill the requirement to only recognize numbers that strictly alternate between exactly two different digits. Therefore, the conclusion of **False** stands, as the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and the annotated version.
