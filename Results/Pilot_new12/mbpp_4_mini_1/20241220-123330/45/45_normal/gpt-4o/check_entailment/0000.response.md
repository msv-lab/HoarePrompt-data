To determine if the program `func_1` correctly checks if a number is undulating, we first define what an undulating number is:

An undulating number alternates between two different digits. For example:
- `1212121` is undulating (1 and 2 alternate)
- `1991` is not undulating (the '9's do not alternate with a different digit)
- `121` is undulating (1 and 2 alternate)

Now, let's analyze the provided implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Length Check**: The function checks if the length of the number (as a string) is less than 3. If it is, it returns `False`. This is correct since a minimum length of 3 is required for an undulating number.

2. **First Two Digits Check**: It assigns the first and second digits and checks if they are the same. If they are, it returns `False`, correctly identifying that an undulating number must have two different starting digits.

3. **Alternating Check**: The function then iterates over the string starting from index 2:
   - It checks if at even indices (which should correspond to the first digit) the digit matches `first_digit`.
   - It checks if at odd indices (which should correspond to the second digit) the digit matches `second_digit`.

By doing this, the function correctly enforces the alternating digit pattern.

### Edge Cases:
- For numbers like `111`, `222` or other numbers having all same digits, it will return `False` correctly.
- For inputs like `12121`, it will return `True`.
  
### Test Cases Provided:
- `1212121` returns `True` -> Correct.
- `1991` returns `False` -> Correct.
- `121` returns `True` -> Correct.

### Additional Consideration:
However, one potential case that the existing program does not handle correctly is if the number contains more than two unique digits. For instance:
- Input: `123123` -> This input should not be considered undulating, but under the current implementation, it will still return `True` (it matches the first two digits `1` and `2` in alternating positions).

### Conclusion:
Since the program may incorrectly label multi-digit cases with more than two unique digits as undulating, we have found a case where the program does not conform to the expectations set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
