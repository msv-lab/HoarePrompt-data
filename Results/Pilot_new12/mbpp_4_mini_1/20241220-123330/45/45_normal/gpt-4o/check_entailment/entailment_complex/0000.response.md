Correctness: **False**

The program does not strictly meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that checks whether a given number is undulating. The term "undulating" generally implies that the digits of the number should alternate in a specific manner. While the provided function appears to check for this alternating pattern, there are key issues:

1. **Length Check**: The function returns `False` for any non-negative integer of fewer than 3 digits. This is stricter than necessary for undulating numbers, as some 2-digit combinations (e.g., `12`, `21`) could still be considered undulating.

2. **Incorrect UNDULATING Logic**: The `func_1` implementation checks only the first two digits and assumes that undulation means the first digit must equal the digit at every even index, and the second digit must equal the digit at every odd index. However, undulation should allow more varied numbers with alternating patterns at larger lengths.

3. **Ambiguity in Definition**: The understanding of "undulating" should potentially include cases or definitions that the current implementation overlooks, leading to a situation where valid undulating numbers could return `False`.

In conclusion, the strict interpretation of patterns and length leads to an output that does not align with all possible undulating numbers. The checks employed are too restrictive and do not encompass the full range of undulating patterns adequately. Thus, the function does not correctly generalize to all valid cases as specified by the problem description.
