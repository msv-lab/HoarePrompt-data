Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as defined in the problem description. Specifically, it fails for non-alternating undulating numbers that have more than two digits but do not start with different digits. 

For example, the input **333** would return `False`, which is correct according to the current implementation since it does not meet the alternating requirement. However, if we consider an undulating pattern such as **121212**, the number alternates correctly, but the program does not check for the condition if there is an undulating pattern that restarts after a point; the logic only checks the first two distinct characters.

An undulating sequence defined could allow numbers like **121** and **212** but the function directly assumes two characters determine the whole sequence which may not hold true for other valid undulating formats, such as longer patterns or sequences. Additionally, if the first digit appeared sporadically instead of constantly being at even indices according to the first two rules, it would still be validly undulating.

Thus, because there could be undulating numbers which do not adhere strictly to the defined non-matching first two digits but do reasonably follow a valid alternation, the implemented logic is flawed for some edge cases. Thus, the program does not fully satisfy the requirements and there are sample inputs where it doesn't work correctly.
