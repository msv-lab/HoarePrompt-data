To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to clearly understand what it means for a number to be "undulating". An undulating number alternates between two distinct digits. The function should return `True` for such numbers and `False` otherwise.

Here’s a breakdown of the logic in the provided function `func_1(n)`:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the length of the number (as a string) is less than 3. If it is, it returns `False`. This makes sense because a number with fewer than three digits cannot alternate meaningfully.

2. **First Two Digits Check**: The function checks whether the first digit is the same as the second digit. If they are the same, it returns `False`, which is correct as an undulating number cannot have the same digit in adjacent positions.

3. **Iterative Check**: The function then iterates through the digits from the third character onwards. It checks for the even indexed characters to match the first character and for the odd indexed characters to match the second character. If any check fails, it returns `False`.

4. **Return**: If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

Now, let’s evaluate if there are any potential cases where the function would return incorrect results.

### Potential Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `func_1(1212121)` should return `True` (which it does).
- **Test Case 2**: `func_1(1991)` should return `False` (which it does).
- **Test Case 3**: `func_1(121)` should return `True` (which it does).
  
Now let’s evaluate a scenario that is not covered:

- **Test Case 4**: Consider `func_1(123456)`. This function would return `False` because it does not have just two alternating digits. But, technically, this is correct behavior and matches the logic.
- **Test Case 5**: Consider `func_1(112)`. The function would return `False`, which is expected. However, the digits do not alternate as required.
  
After analyzing various examples, let's consider a problematic case:

- **Example**: `func_1(12121)`. According to the rules for undulating numbers, this is valid and should return `True` because it alternates between 1 and 2. The function handles this correctly.

### Edge Cases:

- Single digit (`func_1(1)`) returns `False`. This is correct.
- Two digits (`func_1(11)`) returns `False`. This is also correct.
- The number of digits matching `121212` would still return correct as it alternates.

### Summary:

The function does not handle cases where the input is a multi-digit number that does not conform to repeating two alternating distinct digits, but still believes to fit the definition of undulating without distinctiveness, it causes a wrong classification. 

### Conclusion:

After thorough consideration and examination of various test cases, including edge cases, I could not find a case where it fails for its defined behavior. Thus, the implementation correctly identifies undulating numbers.

Hence, the correctness judging from all observations is:

Correctness: **True**
