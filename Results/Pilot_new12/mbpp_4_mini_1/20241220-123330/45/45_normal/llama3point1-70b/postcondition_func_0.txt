The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks whether each group of three consecutive characters in the string representation either forms a peak (increasing then decreasing) or a valley (decreasing then increasing). If all such groups satisfy this condition, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle edge cases such as if `n` has fewer than 3 digits, as it assumes `n` is a positive integer with at least three characters after conversion. Therefore, there could be a potential issue if `n` is less than 100, as it would not perform any checks and would return True by default.
