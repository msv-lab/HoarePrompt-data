To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the requirements stated:

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check if a number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined by the property that its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Analysis:
1. The program converts the number to a string to iterate through its digits.
2. It uses a loop starting from the second digit to the second last digit to check the consecutive digits.
3. The conditional checks for each digit if it is less than the next and greater than the previous, or greater than the next and less than the previous.
4. If these conditions are not met, `undulating` is set to False and the loop stops.

### Identified Issues:
- The loop runs from `1` to `len(n) - 1`, meaning the first and last digits are never checked. This can lead to incorrect results in cases such as:
   - If `n = 121`, then it does not capture that the first digit should start an undulating sequence.
   - For single-digit numbers or numbers with the same repeated digit (like `111`), the function would return `True`, which does not meet the expected undulating criteria.

### Example Case:
- Consider `121`. The correct interpretation should return `True` as it alternates correctly. But if input is `111`, it would incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` since they are not undulating.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not check all the digits properly and has potential edge cases it doesn't handle, it can yield incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
