You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, and `undulating` is True if every group of three consecutive characters in `n` forms either a peak or a valley; otherwise, `undulating` is False if any group does not meet this condition.
    return undulating
    #The program returns True if every group of three consecutive characters in the string representation of the positive integer `n` forms either a peak or a valley; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks whether each group of three consecutive characters in the string representation either forms a peak (increasing then decreasing) or a valley (decreasing then increasing). If all such groups satisfy this condition, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle edge cases such as if `n` has fewer than 3 digits, as it assumes `n` is a positive integer with at least three characters after conversion. Therefore, there could be a potential issue if `n` is less than 100, as it would not perform any checks and would return True by default.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
