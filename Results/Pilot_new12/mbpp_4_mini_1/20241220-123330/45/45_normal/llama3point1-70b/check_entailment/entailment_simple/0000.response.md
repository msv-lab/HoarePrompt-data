Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly implements the definition of "undulating." The typical definition would require that the number alternates between increasing and decreasing values, essentially meaning that it must have a pick or valley at every three consecutive digits. 

The provided implementation does not correctly handle the case where a sequence does not successfully alternate between increasing and decreasing or vice versa. Specifically, the logic in the `if` statement allows the condition of being undulating to go unchecked if three consecutive digits do not alternate (it checks pairs of adjacent digits instead). 

For example, for an input such as `123` or `321`, the program would return `True`, which is incorrect since these numbers do not undulate and are in a strictly increasing or decreasing order, respectively. 

Furthermore, the program fails to account for cases where the sequences may have equal digits, which would also violate a strict undulating pattern.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the problem description.
