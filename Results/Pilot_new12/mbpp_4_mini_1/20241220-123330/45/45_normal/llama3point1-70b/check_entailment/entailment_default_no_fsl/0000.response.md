Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases correctly, specifically when the input number `n` has fewer than three digits. According to the problem description, a valid undulating number must have the properties described, but the program assumes that `n` will always have at least three characters. For example, if `n` is `99` (less than 100), the program does not perform any checks (the for loop will not execute), and it incorrectly returns `True`. 

This is a failure to conform to the problem requirements for all potential cases, as numbers with fewer than three digits can never be undulating. Hence, the absence of logic to deal with numbers that do not meet the minimum length requirement causes the program to produce incorrect results in such cases.
