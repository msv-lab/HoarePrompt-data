The function `func_1` aims to check if a given positive integer `n` is undulating. The code attempts to identify whether the digits of the number alternate in an increasing and decreasing fashion by examining groups of three consecutive digits.

However, the output hints indicate a critical flaw in the implementation. Specifically, if `n` has fewer than 3 digits, the code will skip the loop and return `True` by default, erroneously implying that such numbers are undulating. This situation arises when `n` is a single-digit number (e.g., `5` or `7`) or a two-digit number (e.g., `12`, `99`), where the function does not perform any checks.

Thus, the function does not correctly determine if numbers with fewer than three digits are undulating, leading to an incorrect result in these cases.

Correctness: **False**.
