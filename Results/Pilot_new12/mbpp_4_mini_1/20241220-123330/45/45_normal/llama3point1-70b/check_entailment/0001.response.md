To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description "Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not," I will analyze the implementation.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding "undulating":**
   An undulating number alternates between increasing and decreasing. This means:
   - If digits are represented as `d1, d2, d3, ...`, then:
     - For an undulating sequence: `d1 < d2 > d3 < d4 > d5 ...` or `d1 > d2 < d3 > d4 < d5 ...`.

2. **Program Logic:**
   The loop iterates from the second character to the second-to-last. It checks whether either of the following conditions holds:
   - The current digit is between the previous and next digits when increasing.
   - The current digit is between the previous and next digits when decreasing.
   
   It uses the statement:
   ```python
   if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
   ```
   This logic is flawed for determining undulation because it fails to check if the change from `n[i-1]` to `n[i]` to `n[i+1]` follows the strict alternating pattern, as the check allows for non-alternating situations.

3. **Example Cases to Test:**
   - For `n = 121`, expected result is **True** (since it alternates).
   - For `n = 123`, expected result is **False** (does not alternate).
   - For `n = 212`, expected result is **True** (since it alternates).
   
   Testing these:
   - Test case: `n = 123`
     - Converts to string: `'123'`
     - Loop iterates, finds `n[0] < n[1] < n[2]` which means it falsely allows this non-undulating sequence to pass the check, returning **True** instead of **False**.

This reveals that the program incorrectly classifies non-undulating sequences as undulating.

### Conclusion:
Since I have identified at least one input (like `123`) where the program produces an incorrect result, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
