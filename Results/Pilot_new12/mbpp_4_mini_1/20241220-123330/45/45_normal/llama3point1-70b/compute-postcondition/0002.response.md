According to the code, the loop is controlled by the range from `1` to `len(n) - 1`. For the loop to execute, the value of `len(n)` must be at least 2, since the range would not provide any valid indices if it is less than 2. Currently, `n` is a string representation of an original positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, the length of `n` must be greater than 2 (to allow for valid indices from `1` to `len(n) - 1`).

Also, at the end of the last iteration of the loop, the variable `i` will take values starting from `1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold:
- the string `n` must represent a positive integer with a length of at least 3 (for at least one iteration to happen), 
- `i` will be initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True**
