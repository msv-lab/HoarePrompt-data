Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 1, and `undulating` is True if the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds, and no modifications were made to the variables due to the `pass` statement. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
