The variable `n` is converted to a string, changing its type from a positive integer to a string representation of that integer. The value of `n` is now a string, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of the original positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the original positive integer**.
