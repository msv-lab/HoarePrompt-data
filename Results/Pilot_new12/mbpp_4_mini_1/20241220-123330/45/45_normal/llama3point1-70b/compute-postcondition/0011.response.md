The value of `undulating` is explicitly set to `False`, which overrides its previous value that was dependent on the condition relating to the string `n`. The previous definition of `undulating` being either `True` or `False` based on the condition involving `n` is no longer valid after the assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects the current values and also identifies the change made to `undulating`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `undulating` is set to False.**
