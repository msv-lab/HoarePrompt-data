The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, it checks the string representation of `n` and verifies if every group of three consecutive characters forms either a peak or a valley. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` if every group of three consecutive characters in its string representation forms either a peak or a valley; if not, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns True if every group of three consecutive characters in the string representation of n forms either a peak or a valley. If this condition is not met, it returns False.**
