Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 2. If `n[1] < n[2] and n[0] < n[1]` or `n[1] > n[2] and n[0] > n[1]`, then `undulating` is set to True. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
