Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 5, if the character at index `i` (which is 3) forms a peak or a valley with its adjacent characters, then the function proceeds normally. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
