Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` properly checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`, applying the built-in `all()` function and a generator expression.

The annotated version of the code confirms several key points:

1. **Empty List Handling**: It explicitly states that if the list is empty, the function will correctly return `True`, as the statement about all items holds vacuously true for such a case.

2. **Validation for Single and Multiple Elements**: The function behaves as expected for lists with one or multiple items, returning `True` only if all items match the `element` and `False` if any item differs.

3. **Type Generalization**: The annotations note that `element` can be of any type, with the comparison being valid across various data types, which aligns with the flexibility described in the problem.

Overall, the original assessment remains accurate, as no weaknesses or exceptions were identified in the annotated behaviors that would challenge the correctness of the program. Thus, the conclusion is that the program works correctly as required by the problem description.
