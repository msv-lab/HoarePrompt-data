The provided program checks whether all items in a list are equal to a given element using Python's built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression. 

The function indeed returns True if all elements of the list match the provided element. If the list is empty, as per the output hints, the use of `all()` on an empty iterable returns `True`, which is in line with the problem description stating that the statement "all items are equal" holds vacuously true for an empty list. It also accurately returns False if at least one item differs from the given element.

Since the output hints align perfectly with the desired behavior described in the problem description, this code is functioning as intended for all identified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
