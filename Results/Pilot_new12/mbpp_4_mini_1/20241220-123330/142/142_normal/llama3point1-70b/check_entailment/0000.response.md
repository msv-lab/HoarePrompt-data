Correctness: **True**.

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The usage of `all()` ensures that it will return `True` only if every item in `lst` matches `element`. 

Considerations:
- If the list is empty (`lst = []`), `all()` will return `True`, which is appropriate since there are no items in the list that contradict the condition.
- If `lst` contains multiple items, it checks each item against `element`, and if all are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

There are no cases where the function would fail to meet the requirement outlined in the problem description.
