Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the provided `element`, as required by the problem description. The use of the `all()` function is appropriate, as it evaluates to `True` only if the generator expression returns true for every item in the list. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function will return a boolean indicating whether the condition is satisfied. Additionally, the program's behavior has been explained regarding empty lists, indicating that it aligns with the definition of equality and thus would return `True` in such cases. 

There are no discrepancies between the original assessment and the annotated code. Therefore, the correctness of the program is supported by the provided annotations and adheres to the problem description.
