Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is expected to be a list, and `element`, which can be of any data type. The function then uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to the `element`.

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The program checks if all items in the list are equal to the given `element`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.
   
2. **Correctness**: The use of the generator expression `item == element for item in lst` evaluates to `True` for all items if they are equal to `element`, and `all()` returns `True` if all values are `True`. If at least one item is not equal to `element`, `all()` will return `False`.

3. **Handle Valid Inputs**: The problem explicitly states that valid inputs will be provided, so scenarios such as receiving a non-list or handling empty lists do not need to be considered for correctness verification.

Overall, the function meets the stated requirement consistently for any valid input as stipulated in the problem description.
