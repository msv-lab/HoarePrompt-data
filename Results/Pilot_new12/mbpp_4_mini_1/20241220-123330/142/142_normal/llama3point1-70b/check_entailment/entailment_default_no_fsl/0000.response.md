Correctness: **True**

The function correctly implements the requirement of checking if all items in a given list `lst` are equal to a specified `element`. The use of `all()` ensures that it returns `True` when all items match the `element`, and it also appropriately returns `False` if any item differs. 

Moreover, the behavior of returning `True` for an empty list is aligned with the concept of vacuous truth, which states that there are no counterexamples to disprove the statement when there are no items to consider. Therefore, the function covers all specified cases in the problem description effectively. The output hints reinforce that the implementation encompasses all potential scenarios as required.
