Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate based on the given problem description and the annotations provided. The program `func_1` appropriately checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. 

The reasoning outlined in the original assessment holds true, specifically:
- The program uses the `all()` function, which is well-suited for this type of condition and will return `True` if all items in the list are equal to `element`.
- In the case of an empty list, the use of `all()` will return `True`, aligning with the expectation that "all items are equal" holds vacuously true.
- For cases where the list contains items, it correctly checks each item against the `element`, returning `True` only if they all match, thereby meeting the requirements defined in the problem description.

The annotations further substantiate that the program correctly implements the functionality intended, affirming the correctness claim made in the original assessment. Thus, the original assessment stands validated.
