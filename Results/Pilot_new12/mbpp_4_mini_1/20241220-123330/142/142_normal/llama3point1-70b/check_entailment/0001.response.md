Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an element `element`, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element using the built-in `all()` function in conjunction with a generator expression. 

Here are the key points confirming the correctness of the code:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list `lst` is empty, `all()` will return `True`, which is consistent with the notion that all elements (of which there are none) are equal to the given element.

2. **Single Element List**: If `lst` contains one item and that item equals `element`, it will return `True`. If the item does not equal `element`, it returns `False`, as expected.

3. **Multiple Elements**: For lists containing multiple items, the program will correctly check each item for equality with `element`. It will return `True` only if every item is equal to `element`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

4. **Type Handling**: The function correctly handles different types of elements since the comparison `item == element` can compare various types (e.g., integers, strings).

No cases were found where the program would fail to meet the requirements as per the description; therefore, I conclude that the code is correct in all situations described.
