Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an `element`, and uses a generator expression with the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list is equal to the given `element`.

Key points validating correctness:

1. **Check for Equality**: The expression `item == element` iteratively checks each item in the list against the `element`. This direct equality check aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirement to determine if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. **Handles Empty List**: The `all()` function in Python returns `True` when called on an empty iterable (like an empty list). This behavior is consistent with the logical interpretation of the problem description that "all items are equal" holds vacuously true when there are no items to compare.

3. **Returns Boolean Value**: The final return value of the function is a boolean (`True` or `False`), which explicitly states whether all items in the list are equal to the `element`, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Assumptions about Input**: The problem description specifies valid inputs (a list and an element of any data type). The implementation effectively handles these inputs without assumptions about their specific types while adhering to the equality check, reinforcing that the function is designed correctly according to the stated invariant.

Since the function behaves as described and meets all aspects of the problem requirements, it is correct.
