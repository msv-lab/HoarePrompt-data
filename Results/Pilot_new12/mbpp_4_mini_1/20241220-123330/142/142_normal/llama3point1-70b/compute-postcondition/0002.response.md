Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element` of any data type, returning `True` if all items in the list are equal to `element`. If the list is empty, it will also return `True`, since the statement "all items are equal" holds vacuously true for an empty list. Conversely, it returns `False` if at least one item in the list differs from `element`. This encompasses all cases as specified in the return postconditions.**
