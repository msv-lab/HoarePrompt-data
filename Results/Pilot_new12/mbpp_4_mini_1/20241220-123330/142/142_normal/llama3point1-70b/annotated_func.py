#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of items, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether all items in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element', where 'lst' is a list of items and 'element' can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element` of any data type, returning `True` if all items in the list are equal to `element`. If the list is empty, it will also return `True`, since the statement "all items are equal" holds vacuously true for an empty list. Conversely, it returns `False` if at least one item in the list differs from `element`. This encompasses all cases as specified in the return postconditions.
