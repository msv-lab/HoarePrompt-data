#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `lst` is a list with at least one element, all elements in `lst` must be equal to `element`.  If `lst` is empty, there will be no iterations and `item` does not exist. 
    #
    #Output State:
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It iterates through the list and checks if each item is equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the list is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In summary, it checks for uniformity of the list with respect to the given element. Potential edge cases include handling of an empty list, which is explicitly addressed by returning `True`, and evaluation of lists containing types different from `element`, with which it may not correctly handle comparisons if those types have custom equality logic.
