According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the `item` will represent the first element of the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and `item` should be set to the first element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list**
