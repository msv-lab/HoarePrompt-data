Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It iterates through the list and checks if each item is equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the list is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In summary, it checks for uniformity of the list with respect to the given element. Potential edge cases include handling of an empty list, which is explicitly addressed by returning `True`, and evaluation of lists containing types different from `element`, with which it may not correctly handle comparisons if those types have custom equality logic.**
