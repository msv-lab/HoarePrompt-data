You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, it should check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the list is empty, the return value should logically be `True` (as there are no items that contradict the equality condition), but the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the condition but is not explicitly tested.

Testing `func_1([], 'blue')` would return `True`, but this case is not addressed in the provided assertions, nor is it clear if this behavior is intentional. Therefore, there exists an input case (the empty list) for which the function's behavior should be confirmed, so the program does not completely follow the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `lst` is a list with at least one element, all elements in `lst` must be equal to `element`.  If `lst` is empty, there will be no iterations and `item` does not exist. 
    #
    #Output State:
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It iterates through the list and checks if each item is equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the list is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In summary, it checks for uniformity of the list with respect to the given element. Potential edge cases include handling of an empty list, which is explicitly addressed by returning `True`, and evaluation of lists containing types different from `element`, with which it may not correctly handle comparisons if those types have custom equality logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
