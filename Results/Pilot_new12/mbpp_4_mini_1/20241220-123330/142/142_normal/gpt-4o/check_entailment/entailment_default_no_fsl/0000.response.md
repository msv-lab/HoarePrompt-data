Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly handle a list containing different types of elements in relation to the `element` being compared. For instance, if the list contains a mix of strings and numbers, like `func_1(['1', 1, '1'], 1)`, the function will return `False`, but it silently ignores the semantic meaning of different types that could cause an issue, especially since type differences can lead to false negatives. Additionally, the handling of an empty list is correct (it returns `True`), but the lack of consideration for mixed types might lead to unexpected results. 

Therefore, the function does not satisfy the robustness expected from the problem description for every potential case, leading to an overall judgment of incorrectness.
