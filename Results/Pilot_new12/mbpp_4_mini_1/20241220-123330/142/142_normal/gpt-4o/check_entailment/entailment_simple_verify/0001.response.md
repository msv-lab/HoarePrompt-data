The problem description requires a function that checks if all items in a list are equal to a given element. The function's implementation correctly handles the presence of elements in the list by returning `False` as soon as it finds a mismatch. If the list is empty, it naturally returns `True`, as there are no elements that contradict the equality condition.

The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not explicitly handle the case when the list is empty. However, based on the assumptions that valid input will always be provided, the behavior of returning `True` for an empty list is logically sound and aligns with the requirement that all elements in the list must equal the given element. 

The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies when there are no discrepancies in a list of items when iterating through them and return a meaningful result, even for an empty list.

Given this reasoning and the annotations supporting the functionality as described, I conclude that the original assessment does not correctly reflect the behavior of the program. The function meets the criteria laid out in the problem description with no ambiguity in its intended behavior.

Final: **True**
