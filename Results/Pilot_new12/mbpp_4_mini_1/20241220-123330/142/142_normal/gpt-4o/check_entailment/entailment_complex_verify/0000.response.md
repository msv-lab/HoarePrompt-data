Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, element)` iterates through each item in the given list `lst` and checks if it is equal to the specified `element`. If it finds any item that does not match, it appropriately returns `False`, satisfying the requirement of confirming whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The annotations further support this assessment, as they clarify the program's behavior and expected states. Specifically, the annotations confirm that if the list is empty, the function returns `True`, which is a logical handling of that edge case, and reinforces the correctness of the program. The assertions provided also validate that the function produces the expected results for various inputs, aligning well with the problem's requirements.

Thus, both the reasoning in the original assessment and the additional insights from the annotations lead to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
