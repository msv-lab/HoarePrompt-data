The program follows the requirements set forth in the problem description, which states that the function must take a list and an element, then determine whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here is a breakdown of how the function behaves according to the problem description:

1. **Iterative Check**: The function iterates through each item in the provided list `lst`. If any item is found that does not equal `element`, it immediately returns `False`. This corresponds accurately to the requirement of checking for equality between each list item and the specified element.

2. **Return True for Uniform Lists**: If the function successfully iterates through the entire list without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`. This is in line with the requested behavior that all items should be equal to the `element`.

3. **Empty List Handling**: The problem description implicitly suggests that if the list is empty, there are no items that contradict the condition of equality. As a result, the function correctly returns `True` when given an empty list, conforming to the logic that "all (non-existent) items are equal to the element."

4. **Assertions Validation**: The program includes assertions that verify the correctness of the function for specific scenarios:
   - It asserts that the function returns `False` for a list containing elements not equal to the provided element.
   - It asserts that the function returns `True` when all elements in the list are equal to the provided element.

The function does not violate any requirements and addresses potential edge cases appropriately, such as the treatment of an empty list.

Given all of the above considerations, the program meets the problem description fully.

Correctness: **True**
