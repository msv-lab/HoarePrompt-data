Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case when the input list `lst` is empty. According to the problem description, the function needs to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. However, if the list is empty, the function will return `True`, which does not meet the requirement of "checking whether all items" are equal to the specified element. For an empty list, it is ambiguous whether it should return `True` or `False`, but the problem description does not specify that an empty list should be treated as all items equal to the element. Thus, the behavior of returning `True` for an empty list is not compliant with the spirit of the problem description.

For instance:
- `func_1([], 'blue')` would incorrectly return `True` even though there are no items to compare to the element `'blue'`. 

This lack of handling for the empty list case means the function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
