Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(lst, element)` fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function iterates through the list `lst` and checks if each item is equal to the specified `element`. If an item not equal to the `element` is found, it returns `False`, which meets the criteria of checking whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

The output hints also substantiate this assessment by explaining that the function behaves appropriately for an empty list by returning `True`, aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement, and provides examples of how the program is functioning properly across various cases. Thus, since the function's behavior aligns with the problem description and the examples provided are accurate, the program is indeed correct in its implementation.
