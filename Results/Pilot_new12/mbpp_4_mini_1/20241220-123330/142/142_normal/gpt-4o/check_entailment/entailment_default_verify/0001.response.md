The problem description states that we need a function to check if all items in a list are equal to a given element. The original implementation of the function `func_1` successfully iterates through the list and returns `False` if it encounters any element that differs from the specified element. If all elements are the same, it returns `True`. In the case of an empty list, it implicitly returns `True`, as there are no elements that contradict the condition.

The output hints clarify that the function indeed checks for uniformity and correctly returns `True` for an empty list. This behavior aligns with the logical interpretation of the problem statement, as an empty list does not provide a contradiction regarding equality.

The original assessment concluded that the function was incorrect on the basis that it does not handle empty lists explicitly, which might imply an oversight in confirming this behavior. However, the output hints provided clarify that the current implementation does handle empty lists in a logical manner by returning `True`, which means that the function indeed follows the problem description.

Thus, the reasoning behind the original assessment appears to be inaccurate, as it does not take into account the correct behavior of the function when dealing with an empty list.

Final: **True**
