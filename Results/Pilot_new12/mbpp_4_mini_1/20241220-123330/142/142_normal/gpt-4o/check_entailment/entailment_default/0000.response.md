Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The logic of the function `func_1` is to iterate through the list `lst` and check if each item is equal to the provided `element`, returning `False` if any item does not match. This works as expected for the provided cases. However, the output hints mention that if the list is empty, the function will return `True`. This aspect is indeed covered in the code, but there is a possible edge case that is not addressed: the function does not specify what happens when the `element` is of a different data type than the items in the list. For instance, if the list contains integers and the `element` is a string, the comparison will always return `False` but might mislead users into thinking it should handle such comparisons robustly. The program assumes uniformity in data types, which might lead to incorrect conclusions in cases with mixed types. Thus, it does not handle potential data inconsistencies properly, violating the problem description's expectations for uniformity in comparison.
