The original assessment indicates that the program's correctness is **False** due to the handling of an empty list. However, upon reviewing the annotations and the program's logic, we see that the behavior of returning `True` for an empty list is consistent with the requirement of checking if all items in the list are equal to the given element. In the case of an empty list, there are indeed no items that contradict the condition of equality.

The annotations clarify that if `lst` is empty, the for loop does not execute, and the return statement will output `True`, which aligns with the expected behavior for the problem description. The original assessment seems to misinterpret the requirement regarding the treatment of an empty list.

Based on the reasoning that the function correctly addresses all specified cases, including the condition for an empty list, the program aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original correctness assessment should be updated.

Final: **True**
