You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `lst` is a list with at least one element, all elements in `lst` must be equal to `element`.  If `lst` is empty, there will be no iterations and `item` does not exist. 
    #
    #Output State:
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It iterates through the list and checks if each item is equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the list is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In summary, it checks for uniformity of the list with respect to the given element. Potential edge cases include handling of an empty list, which is explicitly addressed by returning `True`, and evaluation of lists containing types different from `element`, with which it may not correctly handle comparisons if those types have custom equality logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
