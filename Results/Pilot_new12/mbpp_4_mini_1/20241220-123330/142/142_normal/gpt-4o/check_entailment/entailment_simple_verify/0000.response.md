Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The program defines the function `func_1` which successfully checks whether all items in the provided list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. The logic implemented in the function aligns perfectly with the problem description.

1. The function correctly handles the case where any item in the list does not match the element by returning `False`.
2. If the loop completes without finding any unequal item, it indicates that all items are equal to the element and returns `True`.
3. The annotations clearly explain the state of the program both before the function execution and after the loop, reinforcing that if the list is not empty, it will accurately reflect the required checks.

The assertions provided prior to the function are validated by the function's behavior:

- `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')` evaluates to `False`, which is correct as none of the items match 'blue'.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)` evaluates to `False` since none match `7`.
- `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')` evaluates to `True`, correctly indicating all items are 'green'.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem and behaves as intended, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
