Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, it should check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the list is empty, the return value should logically be `True` (as there are no items that contradict the equality condition), but the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the condition but is not explicitly tested.

Testing `func_1([], 'blue')` would return `True`, but this case is not addressed in the provided assertions, nor is it clear if this behavior is intentional. Therefore, there exists an input case (the empty list) for which the function's behavior should be confirmed, so the program does not completely follow the problem description.
