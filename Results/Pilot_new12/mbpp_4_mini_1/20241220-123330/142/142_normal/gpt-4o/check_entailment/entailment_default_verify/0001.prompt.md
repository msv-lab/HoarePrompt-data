You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, it should check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the list is empty, the return value should logically be `True` (as there are no items that contradict the equality condition), but the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the condition but is not explicitly tested.

Testing `func_1([], 'blue')` would return `True`, but this case is not addressed in the provided assertions, nor is it clear if this behavior is intentional. Therefore, there exists an input case (the empty list) for which the function's behavior should be confirmed, so the program does not completely follow the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It iterates through the list and checks if each item is equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`. If the list is empty, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to contradict the condition. Therefore, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In summary, it checks for uniformity of the list with respect to the given element. Potential edge cases include handling of an empty list, which is explicitly addressed by returning `True`, and evaluation of lists containing types different from `element`, with which it may not correctly handle comparisons if those types have custom equality logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
