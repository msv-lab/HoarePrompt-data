Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst, element)` iterates through the provided list `lst` and checks if each item is equal to the specified `element`. If it finds any item that is not equal, it returns `False`, which satisfies the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the loop completes without finding any unequal item, it returns `True`, indicating that all items are equal to the element.

All provided assertions in the program are also correct based on this logic:
1. `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')` returns `False` because none of the list items are 'blue'.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)` returns `False` because none of the list items are `7`.
3. `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')` returns `True` as all items are 'green'.

Since the function covers all potential cases and behaves as required, the program is correct.
