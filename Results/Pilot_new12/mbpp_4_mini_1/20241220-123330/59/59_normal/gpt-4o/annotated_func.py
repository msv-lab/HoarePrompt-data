#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all integers from the combined list formed by concatenating integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parametersâ€”`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, then sorts this combined list in ascending order. Finally, it returns the sorted list containing all the integers from the three input lists. The function does not handle or check for cases where the input lists may be empty, nor does it account for non-integer types that might be included in the input lists. However, given that the parameters are aimed to be lists of integers, the function operates under that assumption and produces a sorted output accordingly.
