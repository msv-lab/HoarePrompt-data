Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists of integers into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists into a single list, then sorts this combined list in ascending order and returns it. The output hints confirm that the function's implementation matches its intended behavior as described in the problem statement. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., lists containing integers), the function handles all potential cases correctly regarding sorting and combining the lists. As such, there are no issues with the implementation that would lead to incorrect results for valid input.
