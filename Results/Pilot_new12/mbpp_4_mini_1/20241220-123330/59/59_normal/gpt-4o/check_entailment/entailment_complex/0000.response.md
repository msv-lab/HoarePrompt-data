Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why the program meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all expected to be lists of integers. According to the problem description, these inputs are always valid, so the function operates under that assumption.

2. **Combining Lists**: The function combines the three input lists into one using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists. This effectively merges the lists as required.

3. **Sorting**: After merging the lists, the program sorts the combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the final output is indeed a sorted list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the sorted list, which aligns perfectly with the output requirement of the problem description, as it specifies that the result should be a single sorted list.

5. **Output Verification**: The assertions provided in the annotated program correctly verify that the function produces the expected output for various test cases, confirming that the implementation behaves as intended. 

Since the function performs the merging and sorting operations correctly and meets the criteria set forth in the problem description, the overall correctness of the program is validated.
