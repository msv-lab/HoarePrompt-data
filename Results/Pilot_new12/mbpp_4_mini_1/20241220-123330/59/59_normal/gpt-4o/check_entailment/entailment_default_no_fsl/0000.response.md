Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and sorts it, as outlined in the problem description. All test cases provided in the assertions produce the correct outputs according to the description. The hints indicate that non-integer types and empty lists are not handled specifically, but these cases are assumed to be valid inputs as stated in the problem description. The function behaves correctly under the assumption that valid inputs (integer lists) are always provided. Thus, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description in every potential case mentioned.
