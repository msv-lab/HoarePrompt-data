Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists and uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list. The test cases provided demonstrate that the function produces the expected sorted output, handling various edge cases including duplicates and differing list lengths. Since no potential cases where the function fails to meet the problem description can be identified, the program is verified as correct.
