Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully merges three lists and sorts them as described in the problem specification. The annotations provide evidence that prior to the function call, all inputs (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) are confirmed to be lists comprising integers. The concatenation and sorting process handled by the function yields the expected output as demonstrated in the provided assertions.

The program has been tested with various cases, including lists with duplicate values, and the output matches the expected results as specified in the assertions. Therefore, based on the problem description and the performance indicated through the annotations, the program is indeed correct.
