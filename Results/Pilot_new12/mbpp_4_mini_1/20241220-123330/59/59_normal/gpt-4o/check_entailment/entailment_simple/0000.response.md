Correctness: **True**

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list, as specified in the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The function `func_1` takes three lists as input (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) and combines them into a single list using the `+` operator. This effectively concatenates the three input lists.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: After merging the lists, the function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the combined list in ascending order. This ensures that all integers from the three input lists are arranged from the smallest to the largest.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the sorted list is returned, which is what the problem description requires.

The program passes all the assertions provided, indicating that it produces the correct sorted lists for the given test cases. Therefore, it is confirmed that the implementation adheres to the problem description by merging and sorting the lists accurately.
