Correctness: **True**

The provided implementation meets the problem description, which requires merging three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them, and then sorts the combined list. The provided test cases verify that the function correctly handles various scenarios, including lists with duplicate values and lists of varying lengths.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The function `func_1` receives three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`).
2. It combines the three lists into a single list using the `+` operator, which effectively concatenates the lists.
3. It utilizes the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list in ascending order.
4. Finally, it returns the sorted list.

Since the solution handles both positive and negative numbers and combines the provided inputs correctly across the given test cases, there are no potential cases apparent that would cause the code to fail per the requirements in the problem description.
