The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct, which is based on the claim that the function correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The assessment claims that the function concatenates the lists and sorts the result, and it backs this up by citing test cases that show correct output.

Analyzing the annotations, they confirm that before the function call, the inputs `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are indeed lists of integers, which aligns with the assumptions stated. The main logic of the function—combining the lists and sorting them—does not have any errors, and the provided test assertions demonstrate that it produces the expected results.

No issues with invalid inputs or exceptions are mentioned, and in line with the provided assumptions, we are to presume the user will provide valid inputs. The annotated state right before the function call indicates that `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers, further supporting the correctness of the function.

Since the original assessment accurately reflects the program's behavior based on both the problem description and the annotations, I conclude that there is no reason to alter the original assessment.

Final: **True**
