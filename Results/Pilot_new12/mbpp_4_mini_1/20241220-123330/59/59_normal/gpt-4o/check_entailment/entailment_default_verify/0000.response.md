Final: **True** 

The original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three input lists and returns a single sorted list, which satisfies the requirements of the problem description. The function uses the built-in `sorted()` method to order the merged list, ensuring the output is correct for the expected integer inputs.

While the output hints point out that the function does not handle edge cases like empty lists or non-integer types, it is specified that we assume valid inputs, hence these points do not detract from the function's correctness as per the provided specification. Since the function successfully meets the stated goal of merging and sorting three lists of integers, the original assessment remains valid.
