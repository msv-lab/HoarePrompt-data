Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` meets the problem description requirements. It correctly merges three lists and sorts the combined elements in ascending order, as confirmed by the provided test cases. The reasoning outlined in the original assessment thoroughly describes how the function processes the input, ensuring all integers from the three lists are accounted for in the final sorted output. 

While the output hints mention the function does not handle cases of empty lists or non-integer types, the problem description specifies that the input will be valid, without indicating the need for additional handling. Given that the function operates correctly under the assumption of receiving valid lists of integers, the assessment of correctness remains valid. Thus, based on the evidence presented, the program functions as expected and aligns with the given problem description.
