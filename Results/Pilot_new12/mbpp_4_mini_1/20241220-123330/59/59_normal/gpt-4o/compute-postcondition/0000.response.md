The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are not affected; they remain as lists of integers. Therefore, the output for `combined_list` will be a new list consisting of all the integers from `list1`, followed by all the integers from `list2`, and then all the integers from `list3`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list that contains all integers from `list1`, followed by all integers from `list2`, and then all integers from `list3`.**
