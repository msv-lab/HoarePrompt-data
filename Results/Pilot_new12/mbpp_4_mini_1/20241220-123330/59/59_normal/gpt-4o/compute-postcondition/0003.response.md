The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it combines the integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, sorts the combined list, and returns the sorted list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a sorted list containing all integers from the combined lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all integers from the combined lists.**
