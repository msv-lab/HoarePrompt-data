The function `func_1` accepts three parametersâ€”`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, then sorts this combined list in ascending order. Finally, it returns the sorted list containing all the integers from the three input lists. The function does not handle or check for cases where the input lists may be empty, nor does it account for non-integer types that might be included in the input lists. However, given that the parameters are aimed to be lists of integers, the function operates under that assumption and produces a sorted output accordingly.
