The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that is the result of concatenating `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, followed by sorting this concatenated list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a sorted list that is the concatenation of these lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters (list1, list2, list3), each being a list of integers, and returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3.**
