#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters (list1, list2, list3), each being a list of integers. It concatenates these three lists into a single list and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the combined lists sorted in ascending order. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists, where if any or all of the input lists are empty, the result will still be a sorted list, which might simply be an empty list. However, the function does not explicitly check for or handle non-integer types, so if any of the input lists contains non-integer values, a TypeError may arise during the sorting process.
