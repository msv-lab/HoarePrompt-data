Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does concatenate the three input lists and sort the resulting list, which technically fulfills the problem description of merging the lists and returning a sorted list. However, the output hints indicate a significant issue: the function does not handle the case of non-integer values in the input lists. Therefore, if any of the lists contain non-integer types, a TypeError may arise during the sorting process. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2]`, `list2 = [3, 'a']`, and `list3 = [4]`, attempting to sort the concatenated list will result in an error. This means the program does not work correctly for every potential case, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
