Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by concatenating them and then using the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the resulting list. This approach works for all potential cases, including lists of different lengths, empty lists, and cases where elements are not in order. The merging and sorting aspects of the function meet the stated requirements in the problem description.
