You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by concatenating the three lists using the `+` operator and then sorting the resulting combined list with the `sorted()` function. 

This approach handles various potential cases, such as:
- All lists are empty: The result will be an empty list, which is correctly sorted.
- Lists with different lengths: The program will handle any combination of list lengths and still yield a correctly sorted output.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function will maintain the correct order, including duplicates.

Since the program's logic consistently adheres to the requirement in the problem description and produces the expected sorted output for all tested cases, it is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters (list1, list2, list3), each being a list of integers. It concatenates these three lists into a single list and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the combined lists sorted in ascending order. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists, where if any or all of the input lists are empty, the result will still be a sorted list, which might simply be an empty list. However, the function does not explicitly check for or handle non-integer types, so if any of the input lists contains non-integer values, a TypeError may arise during the sorting process.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
