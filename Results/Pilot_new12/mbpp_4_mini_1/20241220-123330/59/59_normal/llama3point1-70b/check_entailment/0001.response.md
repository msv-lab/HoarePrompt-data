Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by concatenating the three lists using the `+` operator and then sorting the resulting combined list with the `sorted()` function. 

This approach handles various potential cases, such as:
- All lists are empty: The result will be an empty list, which is correctly sorted.
- Lists with different lengths: The program will handle any combination of list lengths and still yield a correctly sorted output.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function will maintain the correct order, including duplicates.

Since the program's logic consistently adheres to the requirement in the problem description and produces the expected sorted output for all tested cases, it is deemed correct.
