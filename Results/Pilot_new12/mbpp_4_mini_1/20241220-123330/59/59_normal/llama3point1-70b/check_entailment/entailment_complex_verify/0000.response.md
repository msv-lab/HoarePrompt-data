Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the program merges three lists and sorts them correctly, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated code supports this assessment by explicating that the function concatenates the three input lists and returns a sorted version of the combined list. It also confirms that the function handles edge cases like empty lists appropriately. Although the annotation mentions the possibility of a TypeError if non-integer values are included, the problem description specifies that the input will be valid. Based on this assumption, the function behaves correctly according to the stated requirements. Thus, the original assessment of correctness holds true.
