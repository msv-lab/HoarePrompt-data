Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Here's an explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`), which are specified to be lists of integers. This matches the description's requirement.

2. **Concatenation**: The program concatenates these three lists using `list1 + list2 + list3`. This operation combines all elements from the input lists into one single list.

3. **Sorting**: The program uses the built-in `sorted()` function to return a new list that contains the elements of the concatenated list sorted in ascending order. This fulfills the requirement of producing a sorted list.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when any or all of the input lists are empty. If one or more lists are empty, the result will still be a valid sorted list, which could simply be an empty list. 

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: While there is a note about potential `TypeError` due to non-integer values, the problem explicitly states to assume valid input, thus this concern does not affect the correctness evaluation.

Given these points, the program functions correctly according to the problem description, and therefore, the correctness assessment is true.
