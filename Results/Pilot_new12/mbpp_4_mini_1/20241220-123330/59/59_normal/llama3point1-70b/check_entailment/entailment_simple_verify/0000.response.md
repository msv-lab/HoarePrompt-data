Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly merges the three input lists into a single sorted list. The annotations confirm that the inputs `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are indeed lists of integers, and the function uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the concatenated lists. This meets the requirements of the problem description. The approach handles all potential cases appropriately, including different lengths of the lists and empty lists. Therefore, the program fulfills the criteria outlined in the problem description, and the annotations support this correctness.
