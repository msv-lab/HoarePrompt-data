Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements defined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to take three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input parameters. It concatenates these lists using the `+` operator, which combines them into a single list.

2. **Sorting**: The program then uses the `sorted()` function to sort the concatenated list. This ensures that the final output is a single sorted list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Output**: The function returns the sorted list, satisfying the requirement of merging the three input lists into one sorted list.

Since the function performs the concatenation and sorting as expected, it aligns with the problem description, and we can conclude that the implementation is correct. Thus, the program does what the problem statement specifies in every potential case involving valid input.
