Correctness: **False**. 

While the function `func_1` correctly combines the three lists and sorts them, it does not handle the case where the input lists may contain non-integer values. According to the output hints, the absence of checks for data types means that if any list includes non-integer types (like strings or floats), the sorting could raise a `TypeError`. This scenario is a potential case where the program does not fulfill the requirement correctly, leading to an assertion that it does not handle all potential cases per the problem description.
