Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct stands accurate based on the problem description and the provided code, including the annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number, evaluating if the number `n` is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits in `n`. The annotations also affirm that the state of the program before the function call is appropriate, confirming that input is a non-negative integer, which aligns with the typical definition of an Armstrong number. The assertions validate the correct functionality for various cases. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
