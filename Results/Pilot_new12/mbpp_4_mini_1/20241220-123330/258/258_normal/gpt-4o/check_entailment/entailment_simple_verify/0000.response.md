Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately analyzes the behavior of the `func_1` function in the context of determining whether a number is an Armstrong number. The assessment aligns with the problem description, confirms the correctness of the function, and the annotated version supports this by clearly detailing how the function processes the input and assesses whether the given number qualifies as an Armstrong number.

The assertions provided in the original code are consistent with the Armstrong number definition, and the function correctly handles the requisite calculations of raising digits to the appropriate powers. Furthermore, the annotations clarify that the function assumes the input to be a non-negative integer, leading to expected results across the analyzed test cases. Thus, I conclude that the program meets the problem description as intended, validating the initial assessment's correctness.
