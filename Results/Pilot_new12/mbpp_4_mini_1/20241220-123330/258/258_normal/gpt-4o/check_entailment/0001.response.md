Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not, adhering to the problem description. 

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number of n digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of n. The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
1. It converts the number to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the number which defines the power to which each digit is raised.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the length (number of digits).
4. Finally, it compares this sum with the original number, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating it's an Armstrong number) or `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided in the program test the function against various cases, and they all conform to the definition of Armstrong numbers. Given that no potential edge cases or failures were identified, the program is correct.
