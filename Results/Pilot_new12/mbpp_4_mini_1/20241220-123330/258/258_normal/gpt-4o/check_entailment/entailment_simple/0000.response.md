Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

Hereâ€™s how the program fulfills the requirements:

1. **Armstrong Number Definition**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of n. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` converts the number `n` into a string (`num_str`) to iterate over its digits.
   - It calculates `num_len`, the number of digits in `n`.
   - Then it computes the `armstrong_sum` by summing each digit (converted back to an integer) raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - Finally, the function returns `True` if `armstrong_sum` equals the original number `n`, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that test the function with known Armstrong numbers (e.g., `153` returns `True`) and known non-Armstrong numbers (e.g., `259` and `4458` return `False`). This confirms that the function behaves as expected for these cases.

Given these points, the program accurately checks for Armstrong numbers as stipulated by the problem description. Hence, the output is correctly deduced as True.
