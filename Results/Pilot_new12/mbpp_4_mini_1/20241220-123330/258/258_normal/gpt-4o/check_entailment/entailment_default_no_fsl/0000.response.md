Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers. However, it fails to handle the case for `0`, which is an Armstrong number since \(0^1 = 0\). The absence of a test case for `0` in the assertions means that this edge case is not validated. Therefore, while the program functions correctly for the provided examples, it does not handle all possible cases as specified in the problem description, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
