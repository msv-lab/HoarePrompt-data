Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program adheres to the problem description, which requires checking whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the necessary logic to determine if the number is an Armstrong number. 

1. The function takes a non-negative integer as input and converts it to a string, allowing it to iterate through each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits in the number, which is used as the exponent for raising the digits.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
4. It returns `True` if this computed sum equals the original number, indicating an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.

The assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases: for 153 (which is an Armstrong number, yielding `True`), for 259 (not an Armstrong number, yielding `False`), and for 4458 (also not an Armstrong number, yielding `False`). The annotations support the steps and logic in the function appropriately. 

As there are no identified edge cases or discrepancies in functionality, and everything aligns with the problem description, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
