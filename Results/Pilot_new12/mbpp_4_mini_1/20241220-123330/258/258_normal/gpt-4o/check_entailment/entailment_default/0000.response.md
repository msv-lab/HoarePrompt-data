The program provided checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

The provided assertions:
- `func_1(153) == True` (correct)
- `func_1(259) == False` (correct)
- `func_1(4458) == False` (correct)

Let's analyze the code and the output hints:
```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

The output hints describe that the function takes a non-negative integer, converts it to a string to determine the number of its digits, and then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. It returns `True` if this sum equals the original number, indicating that it is an Armstrong number.

The function is well-implemented and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers. It can handle all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers, which are trivially Armstrong numbers since a single-digit number raised to the power of 1 is itself (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ..., 9).

All edge cases for non-negative integers are covered:
- Single-digit Armstrong numbers (0 to 9).
- Three-digit Armstrong numbers like 153, 370, 371, and 407.
- It correctly returns `False` for numbers that are not Armstrong numbers.

Given this understanding of the code, there are no indications or examples that demonstrate the function failing to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Since it correctly handles Armstrong number checks for every potential case expected based on the problem description and input hints, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
