You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: To check if the provided program meets the description of identifying whether a number is an Armstrong number, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The definition of an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is that the sum of its own digits raised to the power of `n` should be equal to the number itself.

1. The function correctly converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. It computes the length of that string, which gives the digit count (n).
3. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of n.
4. Finally, it checks if that sum is equal to the original number.

Now, let's consider potential cases:

- The provided assertions check for three cases:
  - 153 is an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153), so it returns True.
  - 259 is not an Armstrong number (2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856), so it returns False.
  - 4458 is also not an Armstrong number (4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4293), so it returns False.
  
Let's test additional boundary cases:

- For a single-digit number like `0`, according to the Armstrong definition, `0^1 = 0`, which is correct. Thus, it should return True.
- For a number like `9`, `9^1 = 9`; again, it should return True.
- For `10`, `1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1`, which is not equal to 10, so it should return False.

The function should also handle negative numbers, which are not considered in the Armstrong number definition. However, technically it would always return False since raising negative digits to any power would yield positive sums.

Since no issues arise from verifying through additional test cases nor from the provided assertions, the function seems to properly implement the Armstrong number check for all integers.

Based on the above reasoning, no cases are found where the function does not work as expected:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies Armstrong numbers by calculating the sum of the digits raised to the appropriate exponent and checking against the number itself. Each tested case confirms expected behavior with no apparent edge cases failing.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit of 'n' raised to the power of the length of the string representation of 'n' is equal to 'n', indicating that 'n' is an Armstrong number.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
