Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single non-negative integer `n` as input, which is in line with the problem's requirements.

2. **Armstrong Number Definition**: An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The example provided in the assertions correctly checks whether:
   - For `153`, the calculation is \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), hence it is an Armstrong number, returning `True`.
   - For `259`, the calculation is \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862\), which is not equal to `259`, thus it returns `False`.
   - For `4458`, the calculation is \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4223\), which is not equal to `4458`, thus it returns `False`.

3. **Logic Implementation**: The logic inside the function accurately calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits. The use of list comprehension and the built-in `sum` function is both efficient and concise.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program adheres to the problem requirements by correctly handling any non-negative integer. This includes checking corner cases like single-digit numbers (0 through 9), which are all Armstrong numbers since \(d^1 = d\), where \(d\) is any digit from 0 to 9.

5. **Overall Functionality**: There are no missing functionalities or edge cases neglected, given the assumption that the input will always be valid and non-negative.

Therefore, since the program accomplishes the task described in the problem statement without deviation, the overall correctness of the implementation is affirmed.
