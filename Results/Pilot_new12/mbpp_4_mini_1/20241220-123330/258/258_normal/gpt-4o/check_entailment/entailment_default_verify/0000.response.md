The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks whether a number is an Armstrong number by following the established definition. It thoroughly explains how the function works: converting the number to a string, determining the number of digits, calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the digit count, and comparing that sum to the original number.

The output hints further affirm the correctness of the function, stating that it accurately handles non-negative integers and checks for Armstrong numbers as expected. They also verify that the function does not have any missing functionalities or edge cases that could cause it to behave incorrectly, considering only non-negative integer inputs as specified in the problem description.

Given that the original assessment aligns with the functionality described in the problem and supported by the output hints, I find no reason to diverge from the initial conclusion regarding the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
