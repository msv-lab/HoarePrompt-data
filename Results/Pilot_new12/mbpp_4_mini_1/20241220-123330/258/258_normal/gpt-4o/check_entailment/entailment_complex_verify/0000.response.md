Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the behavior of the program as described in the problem statement. The reasoning confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies Armstrong numbers by following the defined mathematical criteria. All provided assertions are validated by the function, and the annotated version further reinforces the correctness by explicitly explaining the steps taken within the function. The program handles the specified cases properly and meets the requirements set forth in the problem description without any missed functionalities or edge cases. Thus, the conclusion of correctness remains supported by both the original assessment and the annotations.
