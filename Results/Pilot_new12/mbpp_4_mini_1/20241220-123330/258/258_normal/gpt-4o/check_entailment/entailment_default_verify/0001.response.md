Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly adheres to the problem description of checking whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The program performs the following correctly:
1. It converts the input number to a string to facilitate digit extraction.
2. It calculates the number of digits, which determines the exponent to which each digit should be raised.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
4. It checks if this computed sum equals the original number and returns the appropriate boolean result.

The output hints confirm that the function handles all non-negative integers correctly and does not miss any functionalities or edge cases. The assertions demonstrate that the program is tested against known Armstrong numbers and confirms its correctness.

Given all this information, the program accurately fulfills the stated requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
