#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit of 'n' raised to the power of the length of the string representation of 'n' is equal to 'n', indicating that 'n' is an Armstrong number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if `n` is an Armstrong number. It does this by converting `n` to a string to determine the number of digits. It then sums each digit raised to the power of the length of the string representation of `n`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, as specified. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
