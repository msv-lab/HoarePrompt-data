The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it evaluates whether the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the length of the string representation of `n` is equal to `n`. If this condition holds true, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number. If the condition does not hold, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and determine if `n` is an Armstrong number by comparing the calculated sum to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
