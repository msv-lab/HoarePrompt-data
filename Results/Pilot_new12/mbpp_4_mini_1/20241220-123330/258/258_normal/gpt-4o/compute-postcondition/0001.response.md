The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of `len(num_str)`, which is the length of the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string of digits representing `n`. The length of `num_str` will therefore depend on the number of digits in `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.**
