In the initial state, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `num_len` is the length of `num_str`. The code computes the Armstrong sum for the digits in `num_str`, where each digit is raised to the power of `num_len` and then summed.

Here's the impact of the code:

1. `int(digit)` converts each character (digit) of `num_str` into an integer.
2. Each integer is then raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the length of `num_str`.
3. The sum of these powered integers is computed and stored in `armstrong_sum`.

At this point, the value of `armstrong_sum` will be the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the length of `num_str`. The variables `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
