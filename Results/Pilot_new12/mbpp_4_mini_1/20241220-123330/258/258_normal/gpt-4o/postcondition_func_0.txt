The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if `n` is an Armstrong number. It does this by converting `n` to a string to determine the number of digits. It then sums each digit raised to the power of the length of the string representation of `n`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, as specified. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
