The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks whether it is a "Narcissistic number" (also known as an Armstrong number). It computes the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, indicating that `num` is a Narcissistic number. If the computed sum does not equal `num`, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the function effectively identifies Narcissistic numbers among non-negative integers. Note that potential edge cases, such as single-digit numbers (which are always Narcissistic), are handled since each digit raised to the power of one equals the digit itself.
