The annotated program appears to be implementing the functionality to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of `n`. The way the program is structured aligns with this definition:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(num)` takes a non-negative integer as input.
2. **String Conversion**: It converts the number to a string to facilitate iterating over each digit.
3. **Length Calculation**: The number of digits is calculated (`num_len`).
4. **Sum Calculation**: It sums each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
5. **Comparison**: It returns whether this sum equals the original number.

### Key Points:
- The input is assumed to be a non-negative integer.
- The program correctly calculates whether the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.
- The return value is a boolean indicating if the number is an Armstrong number, which matches the requirements of the problem.

Given these points, the program fulfills the problem description adequately.

Correctness: **True**.
