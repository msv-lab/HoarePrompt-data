Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly checks if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The logic in the function correctly:

1. Converts the given number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Determines the number of digits in the number.
3. Calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Compares this sum to the original number.

This logic holds true for all integer inputs, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (which are all Armstrong numbers), and works correctly for multi-digit numbers.

I cannot find a case where this program does not work as expected, confirming that it meets the problem's requirements accurately.
