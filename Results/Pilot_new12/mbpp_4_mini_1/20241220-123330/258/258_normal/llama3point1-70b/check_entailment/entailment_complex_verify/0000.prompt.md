You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: To verify the given Python program for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number, let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153.
- 9474 is also an Armstrong number because 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474.

Next, let's consider if the implementation correctly identifies Armstrong numbers.

1. The input number is converted to a string to determine the number of digits (`num_len`).
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

Now, we need to check if this program has any potential issues or edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

- Let's consider a number with a single digit, for example, `0`. The only digit is `0`, and since 0¹ = 0, the function should return `True`. This works correctly.
- For another example, consider negative numbers, for instance, `-153`. The program will still run because it converts `num` to a string and will simply raise an exception while trying to perform exponentiation, which is not part of Armstrong number definitions.

However, if you input `-153`, it converts to the string `"-153"` and the length gets calculated as `4` (which is incorrect since potential Armstrong check is only for non-negative integers). This will lead to `sum` calculating `(-1)⁴ + 5⁴ + 3⁴`, which is not valid. 

Furthermore, there are also potential cases like:
- Floating-point numbers (e.g., `153.0`). The function does not account for this type of input and should raise an error or return incorrect values.
  
Thus, these examples illustrate that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, specifically it does not handle negative and non-integer values appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` represents `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if 'sum', which is the sum of each digit in 'num' raised to the power of 'num_len', equals 'num'; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks whether it is a "Narcissistic number" (also known as an Armstrong number). It computes the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, indicating that `num` is a Narcissistic number. If the computed sum does not equal `num`, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the function effectively identifies Narcissistic numbers among non-negative integers. Note that potential edge cases, such as single-digit numbers (which are always Narcissistic), are handled since each digit raised to the power of one equals the digit itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
