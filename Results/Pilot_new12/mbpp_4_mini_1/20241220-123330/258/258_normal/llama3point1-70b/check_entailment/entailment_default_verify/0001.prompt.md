You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly checks if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The logic in the function correctly:

1. Converts the given number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Determines the number of digits in the number.
3. Calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Compares this sum to the original number.

This logic holds true for all integer inputs, including edge cases such as single-digit numbers (which are all Armstrong numbers), and works correctly for multi-digit numbers.

I cannot find a case where this program does not work as expected, confirming that it meets the problem's requirements accurately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks whether it is a "Narcissistic number" (also known as an Armstrong number). It computes the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, indicating that `num` is a Narcissistic number. If the computed sum does not equal `num`, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the function effectively identifies Narcissistic numbers among non-negative integers. Note that potential edge cases, such as single-digit numbers (which are always Narcissistic), are handled since each digit raised to the power of one equals the digit itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
