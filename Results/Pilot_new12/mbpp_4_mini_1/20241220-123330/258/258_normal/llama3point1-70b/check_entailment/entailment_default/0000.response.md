The code provided checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number). The function converts the number to a string to find its digits and calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the implementation, and the output hints, we can conclude the following:

1. The function correctly identifies Narcissistic numbers based on the definition provided in the problem description.
2. The output hints confirm that the function computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits and checks if this sum equals the original number, which is indeed the right approach to determine if a number is an Armstrong number.
3. The function handles zero and single-digit numbers correctly, as these are always considered Narcissistic numbers. For example, for `num = 0`, the sum would equal `0`, and for any single-digit number, `num`, the calculation will hold true since `num^1 = num`.

Since there are no edge cases identified where the function would fail to perform according to the problem's requirements, the implementation is valid in all tested cases.

Correctness: **True**.
