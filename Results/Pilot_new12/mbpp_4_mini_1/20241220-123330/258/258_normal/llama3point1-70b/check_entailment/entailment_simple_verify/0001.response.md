Based on the analysis of the problem description, program code, original assessment, and the provided annotated version, we can determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Description**: The objective is to write a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is defined as one where the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself.

2. **Program Explanation**: The function `func_1(num)` converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, computes the number of digits, and then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. It finally checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment concludes that the implementation is correct. It recognizes that the logic correctly checks whether the provided number satisfies the Armstrong condition for both single-digit and multi-digit numbers.

4. **Annotated Code**: The annotations confirm that prior to the loop, `num` is a non-negative integer. After the loop, `num`, `num_str`, `num_len`, and `sum` are all correctly described, affirming that `sum` accurately reflects the calculation needed to determine if `num` is an Armstrong number.

5. **Final Evaluation**: The annotations support the correctness of the program's logic. It matches accurately with the problem description and ensures that no edge cases are overlooked based on the constraints given (valid input assumption).

Given all of this, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
