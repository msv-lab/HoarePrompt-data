Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function that checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number).

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`.
2. **String Representation**: It converts the number to a string to easily access each digit.
3. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the number of digits in `num` and stores it in `num_len`.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The function iterates through each digit, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and sums these values.
5. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if the computed sum equals the original number; if they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. If not, it returns `False`.

The program accounts for all necessary cases, including handling single-digit numbers correctly, which are always Armstrong numbers since each digit to the power of 1 equals the digit itself.

Overall, the program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles the defined input correctly, guaranteeing a correct result for all non-negative integers. Thus, the output is "True".
