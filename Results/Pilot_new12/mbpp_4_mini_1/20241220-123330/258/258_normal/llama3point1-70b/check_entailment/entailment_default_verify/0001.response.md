Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. The function:

1. Converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. Calculates the total number of digits.
3. Sums each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Compares the computed sum to the original number.

The output hints confirm that the function handles potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers, which are all considered Armstrong numbers. The logic is sound, and the output behavior aligns with the problem description, thus affirming the correctness.
