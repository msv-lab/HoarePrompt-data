The original assessment outlined several key points about the function's behavior and provided examples demonstrating potential edge cases, specifically regarding negative numbers and floating-point numbers. It concluded that the program does not handle all scenarios correctly and assessed the correctness of the program as **False**. 

However, the annotated version specifies that the function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer. This indicates that any cases involving negative integers or other non-integer values are assumed not to occur, and thus do not represent a failure of the implementation under the specified assumption. The annotation further clarifies that the function correctly identifies Armstrong numbers among the specified input range (non-negative integers).

Since the annotations support that the program only processes valid non-negative integers and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers within that context, the original assessment that leads to a conclusion of incorrectness in a broader context can be understood to be overly cautious given the assumptions.

The function works as intended for non-negative integers, correctly determining if the input is an Armstrong number. 

Thus, based on the annotations and under the assumption that input will always be valid (non-negative integers), I maintain:

Final: **True**.
