To verify the given Python program for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number, let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153.
- 9474 is also an Armstrong number because 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474.

Next, let's consider if the implementation correctly identifies Armstrong numbers.

1. The input number is converted to a string to determine the number of digits (`num_len`).
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

Now, we need to check if this program has any potential issues or edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

- Let's consider a number with a single digit, for example, `0`. The only digit is `0`, and since 0¹ = 0, the function should return `True`. This works correctly.
- For another example, consider negative numbers, for instance, `-153`. The program will still run because it converts `num` to a string and will simply raise an exception while trying to perform exponentiation, which is not part of Armstrong number definitions.

However, if you input `-153`, it converts to the string `"-153"` and the length gets calculated as `4` (which is incorrect since potential Armstrong check is only for non-negative integers). This will lead to `sum` calculating `(-1)⁴ + 5⁴ + 3⁴`, which is not valid. 

Furthermore, there are also potential cases like:
- Floating-point numbers (e.g., `153.0`). The function does not account for this type of input and should raise an error or return incorrect values.
  
Thus, these examples illustrate that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, specifically it does not handle negative and non-integer values appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.
