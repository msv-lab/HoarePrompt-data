Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly implements the logic to determine if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong (or Narcissistic) number. The function converts the number to a string to count the number of digits, then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits. It returns `True` if this sum equals the original number and `False` otherwise. 

The output hints clarify that single-digit numbers are correctly recognized as Narcissistic since each digit raised to the power of one equals the digit itself. 

Moreover, because the function operates only on non-negative integers, which is aligned with the problem description, it effectively handles all the potential cases as specified. There are no identified cases or examples where the function fails to produce the correct output for every potential valid input. Thus, the function's correctness can be affirmed across all scenarios described in the problem statement.
