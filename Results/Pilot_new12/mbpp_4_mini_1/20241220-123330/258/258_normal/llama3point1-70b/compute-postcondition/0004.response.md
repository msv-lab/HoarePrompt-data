The value of `sum` is incremented by the result of `int(digit) ** num_len`. The variable `num` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, and hence `num_len` is greater than 0. The value of `digit` is specifically a character derived from `num_str`, which must also have at least one character. Since `num_len` is the number of digits of `num` and is greater than 0, this implies that `int(digit)` will also yield a non-negative integer raised to a positive integer. 

The impact of the code snippet on the variables is as follows:
1. `sum` is updated by adding the powered value of `digit`.
2. Neither `num`, `num_str`, nor `num_len` are affected by the operation aside from providing necessary parameters.

Thus, the output state can be expressed as: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 1 character, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is increased by `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 1 character, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is incremented by `int(digit) ** num_len`.**
