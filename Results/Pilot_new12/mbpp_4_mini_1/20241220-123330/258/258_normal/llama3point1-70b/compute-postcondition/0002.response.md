The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, and this is the only change taking place in the code. The values of the other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sum` is now 0, while the other variables retain their pre-existing values.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0**
