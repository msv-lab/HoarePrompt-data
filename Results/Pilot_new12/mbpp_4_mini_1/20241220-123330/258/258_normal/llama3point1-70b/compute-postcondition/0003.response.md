According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_str`. The loop will iterate over each character (digit) in the string representation of `num`. For the loop to be executed, `num_str` must contain at least one character, which means that `num` must be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. Furthermore, since `num_str` represents `num`, it must also accurately reflect the number of digits (which is indicated by `num_len`).

1. `num` must be a non-negative integer (this is already given).
2. `num_str` must correctly represent `num` as a string (which is also given).
3. `num_len` (the number of digits in `num`) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `sum` starts at 0, but it does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be affirmed or adjusted:

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` must have at least 1 character, `num_len` is the number of digits in num (must be greater than 0)**
