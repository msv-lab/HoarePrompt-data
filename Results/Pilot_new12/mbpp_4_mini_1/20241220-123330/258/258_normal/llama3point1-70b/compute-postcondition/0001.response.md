The code assigns the length of the string `num_str` to the variable `num_len`. The variable `num` is a non-negative integer, and `num_str` is its string representation, which means that the length of `num_str` corresponds to the number of digits in `num`.

Since `num` is non-negative, `num_str` will always have a length of at least 1 (for `num` = 0) or more digits otherwise. Thus, `num_len` will be a positive integer representing the total number of digits in `num`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `num`; `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`.**
