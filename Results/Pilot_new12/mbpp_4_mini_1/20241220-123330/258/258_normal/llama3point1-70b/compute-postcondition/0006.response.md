The expression `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` means that `sum` is incremented by the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. Given that `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` has at least 2 characters, and `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, we can derive the following insights:

- The value of `int(digit)` will depend on the current digit being processed, which is part of `num_str`.
- The power `num_len` represents the number of digits in `num`, so it is always a positive integer.

Since `sum` is incremented by some value based on `digit` and `num_len`, its value will increase.

Thus, the output reflecting the updated state will specify that `sum` is incremented, and maintain the conditions on the rest of the variables.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is incremented by `int(digit) ** num_len`.**
