According to the code, the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `num_str`. To execute one more time, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters (since it has at least 1 character now). At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has at least 1 character and `digit` represents the last character processed. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character must be processed. If `num_str` had 1 character in the previous iteration, it means the loop is just finishing, and for it to proceed again `digit` must represent the next character in `num_str` based on its current length.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is incremented by `int(digit)` for the next digit to be processed.**
