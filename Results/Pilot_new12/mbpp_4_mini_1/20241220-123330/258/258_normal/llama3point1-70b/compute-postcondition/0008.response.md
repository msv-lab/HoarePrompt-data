The expression `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` increments the variable `sum` by raising `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len` and then adding that result to the current value of `sum`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` must have at least 3 characters, so `num` has at least 3 digits.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num` + 1, meaning `num_len` is at least 4 (since the minimum number of digits in `num` is 3).
- `digit` must be a single character from `num_str`, which in this case can be any digit from the original `num`.

Assuming `digit` is one of the digits of `num`, the code effectively adds `int(digit) ** num_len`, a positive integer, to `sum`.

Therefore, we update `sum` to reflect this change, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 3 characters, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num` + 1, and `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.**
