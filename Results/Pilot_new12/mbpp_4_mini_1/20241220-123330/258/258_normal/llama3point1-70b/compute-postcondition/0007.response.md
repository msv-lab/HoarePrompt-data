According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `num_str`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current state of `num_str` and the current position of the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters, so for the loop to continue, it must have at least 3 characters. Since `digit` represents the current character of `num_str`, if the loop has already iterated through a number of digits equal to `num_len`, the next value of `digit` will correspond to the next character in `num_str`, which implies we are moving to the next digit.

Therefore, if at the end of the last iteration `num_len` is equal to the length of `num_str`, for the loop to execute again, `num_len` must be incremented by 1, and `digit` will represent the next character in `num_str`. Thus, the state needs to reflect that `num_len` has moved to 1 more than it presently is and we're now accessing the next character.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` must have at least 3 characters, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num` + 1, and `sum` is incremented by `int(digit)`**
