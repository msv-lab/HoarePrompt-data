The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. The function concatenates all elements of `list1` except the last one with all elements of `list2` and returns the resulting list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list that combines all elements from `list1` except the last one with all elements from `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a new list containing all elements from list1 excluding the last element, concatenated with all elements from list2.**
