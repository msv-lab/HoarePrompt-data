To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` accurately fulfills the requirement to replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`).

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to create a function that:
- Takes in two lists.
- Replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list.

### Function Behavior:
Looking at the provided `func_1` implementation:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
```

The key points about the function:
1. `list1[:-1]` returns all elements of `list1` except the last one.
2. `list2` is appended to this result.

### Observations:
- The problem description specifically states that the last element of `list1` should be replaced, not simply excluded.
- The provided implementation does not replace the last element; instead, it excludes it and concatenates `list2`.
- Therefore, if `list1` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` and `list2` is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, the function would return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which does not replace the last element (`10` in this case) with the elements of `list2`.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not adequately meet the requirement of replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`, it does not satisfy the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The function's behavior leads to an incorrect output under the requirements provided in the problem description, as it simply concatenates without replacing the last element of `list1`.
