Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description requirements. According to the problem description, the last element of the first list should be replaced with the entire second list, but the implementation slices `list1` to exclude the last element and concatenates it with `list2` instead of replacing the last element with the contents of `list2`. 

For example, for the input `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8])`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]` (where `5` is replaced), but the actual output would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` which does not fulfill the requirement of replacing the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. 

This indicates that the logic of the function does not meet the requirement in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
