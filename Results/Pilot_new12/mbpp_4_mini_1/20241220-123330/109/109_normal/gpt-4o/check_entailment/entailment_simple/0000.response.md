The provided program implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires replacing the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

Let's analyze the implementation in the `func_1` function:

The implementation consists of the following code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
```

### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **`list1[:-1]`**: This slice returns all elements of `list1` except the last one. For example, if `list1` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]`, `list1[:-1]` will return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

2. **Concatenation with `list2`**: The operation `list1[:-1] + list2` concatenates the sliced list (all but the last element of `list1`) with `list2`. This effectively replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements from `list2`.

This operation meets the requirement of the problem as described since it forms a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced by all elements from `list2`.

### Validation of Assertions

The assertions provided test specific input cases:

1. `assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` - Correct, replaces the last `10` with `2, 4, 6, 8`.
  
2. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` - Correct, replaces the last `5` with `5, 6, 7, 8`.

3. `assert func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow']) == ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']` - Correct, replaces the last `green` with `yellow`.

### Conclusion

Since the function correctly implements the desired functionality by adhering to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
