You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
assert func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow']) == ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
    #The program returns all elements of list1 except the last one concatenated with all elements of list2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are expected to be lists. It returns a new list that consists of all elements from `list1` excluding the last element, concatenated with all elements from `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the returned list will simply contain all elements of `list2`. If `list2` is empty, the returned list will contain all elements of `list1` except the last one. The function does not handle any specific error cases for non-list inputs, but it assumes that both inputs are lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
