Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list, but the function instead disregards the last element of the first list entirely and uses the rest of the first list concatenated with the second list. 

For example, given the inputs `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the expected output based on the description should be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which the function achieves. However, on closer inspection:

For the input `func_1([1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7, 8])`, the correct result should be `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]` (replace the last element `3` with the entire second list), but the function will return `[1, 2] + [5, 6, 7, 8] => [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. 

This indicates a misunderstanding of the specification regarding how the last element of the first list should be replaced. Thus, the function does not handle the specified requirement properly; it should include the elements of the second list in place of the last element rather than excluding one or more elements of the first list before concatenating. 

Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
