The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are expected to be lists. It returns a new list that consists of all elements from `list1` excluding the last element, concatenated with all elements from `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the returned list will simply contain all elements of `list2`. If `list2` is empty, the returned list will contain all elements of `list1` except the last one. The function does not handle any specific error cases for non-list inputs, but it assumes that both inputs are lists.
