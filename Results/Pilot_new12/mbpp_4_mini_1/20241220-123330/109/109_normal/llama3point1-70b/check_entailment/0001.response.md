To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to take in two lists and replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Analysis
1. **Replacing Last Element**:
   - The line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
   - If `list1` is not empty, this line executes and modifies `list1` correctly.
   - However, if `list1` is empty, the else part executes where `list1` is assigned the value of `list2`. This does not adhere to the requirement of replacing the last element if it doesn't exist.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `list1` has one element `[1]` and `list2` is `[2, 3]`, the expected result should be `[2, 3]` (replacing the single last elements with elements from `list2`).
   - If `list1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the expected result should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]` (replacing `3` with `4, 5`).
   - If `list1` is empty `[]` and `list2` is `[1, 2]`, it should ideally throw an error or handle this case specifically instead of simply replacing it with `list2`.

### Problematic Case
For the case where `list1` is empty (`[]`) and `list2` is `[1, 2]`, the function will return `[1, 2]`, which does not satisfy the requirement of modifying the last element of `list1` because there is no last element to replace.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description for all potential inputs, particularly when `list1` is empty. 

Correctness: **False**
