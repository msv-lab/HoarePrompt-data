Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when `list1` is empty. According to the problem description, if the first list (`list1`) is empty, it should be replaced with the elements of the second list (`list2`). However, the code `list1 = list2` does not modify `list1` in the calling context, as it only creates a new local reference to `list2` within the function scope. This means that after the function execution, `list1` remains unchanged if it was empty.

For example:
- Input: `list1 = []`, `list2 = [1, 2, 3]`
- Expected Output: `list1` should become `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Actual Output: `list1` remains `[]`.

This shows that the program does not work as specified when `list1` is empty.
