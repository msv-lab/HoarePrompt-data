#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is not empty, it contains all its original elements except the last one, concatenated with the elements of `list2`, while `list2` remains unchanged. If `list1` is empty, it now references `list2`, making `list1` the same as `list2`.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which will either be a concatenation of all elements from the original list1 except the last one with list2 if list1 is not empty, or it will be identical to list2 if list1 is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It modifies `list1` based on its contents: if `list1` is not empty, the function replaces its last element with the entirety of `list2`, effectively concatenating `list2` to the beginning of `list1` (except for its last element). If `list1` is empty, the function creates a new reference to `list2`, making `list1` identical to `list2`. The function then returns `list1`. However, because the code modifies the list in-place when `list1` is non-empty and reassigns `list1` when it is empty, the original `list1` outside the function may not reflect these changes, potentially leading to confusion about the state of `list1` post-function call. The annotations are correct but lack clarity regarding the side effects of modifying `list1` in place versus reassigning it.
