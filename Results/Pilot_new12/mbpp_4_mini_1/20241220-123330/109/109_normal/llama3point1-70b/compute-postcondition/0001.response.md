The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire `list2` list. Given that `list1` is non-empty, it originally contained at least one element. The last element of `list1` is removed, and `list2` is assigned in its place. 

The state of `list1` will now depend on the size of `list2`. If `list2` has `n` elements, then `list1` will now have its elements from the beginning up to the second-to-last element of the original `list1` plus all the elements of `list2`.

The impact of the code on the program is then to adjust `list1` accordingly.

Output State: **`list1` is the list containing its original elements except the last one concatenated with the elements of `list2`, `list2` is unchanged.**
