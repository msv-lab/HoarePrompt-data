The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. If `list1` is not empty, the function returns a new list that is a concatenation of all elements from `list1` except the last one with `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the function returns `list2` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a concatenated list based on whether `list1` is empty or not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, both lists. It returns a concatenation of list1 (excluding the last element) with list2 if list1 is not empty; otherwise, it returns list2 unchanged if list1 is empty.**
