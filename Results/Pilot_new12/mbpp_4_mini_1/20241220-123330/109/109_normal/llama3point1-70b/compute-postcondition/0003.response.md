The assignment `list1 = list2` means that `list1` is now referencing the same list object as `list2`. Consequently, any changes made to `list1` will also affect `list2` and vice versa since they both point to the same object in memory. Since the initial condition states that `list1` is empty, it will now hold the same references and content as `list2`, irrespective of `list2`'s previous content.

Output State: **`list1` now references `list2`; `list1` is the same as `list2`.**
