Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is not empty, it contains all its original elements except the last one, concatenated with the elements of `list2`, while `list2` remains unchanged. If `list1` is empty, it now references `list2`, making `list1` the same as `list2`.***
