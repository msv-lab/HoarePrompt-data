#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string in which the occurrences of the substring 'std' are to be counted.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns an integer representing the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string. If the substring is not found, it will return 0. The function handles cases where the input string may be empty or does not contain the specified substring.
