The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string in which the occurrences of the substring 'std' are to be counted. After executing the function body, it returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` and return the number of times the substring 'std' appears in it.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string, and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string s.**
