Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` which counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The program is correct for the following reasons:

1. **Functionality**: The function uses Python's built-in `str.count()` method which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std'. This behavior has been confirmed with assertions that cover various cases.

2. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided are comprehensive and cover different scenarios:
   - A string that contains multiple instances of 'std' (e.g., 'letstdlenstdporstd' returns 3).
   - A string with a single instance of 'std' (e.g., 'truststdsolensporsd' returns 1).
   - A string that contains 'std' at the start and end (e.g., 'makestdsostdworthit' returns 2).
   - The case of an empty string (e.g., '' returns 0).
   - A string that only contains 'std' (e.g., 'std' returns 1).

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles an empty string and accurately counts the occurrences of 'std' without missing any valid cases.

As there are no potential cases where the function would return an incorrect result based on the problem description and the provided examples, the assertion that the program is correct holds true.
