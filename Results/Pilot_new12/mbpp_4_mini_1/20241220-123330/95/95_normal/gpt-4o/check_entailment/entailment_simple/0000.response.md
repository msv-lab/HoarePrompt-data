Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`. The function `func_1(s)` uses the built-in method `count`, which is designed to return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in the string. The test assertions provided further validate that the function behaves as expected across various input scenarios, including edge cases such as an empty string.

Specifically, the following cases are handled correctly:
- The input `'letstdlenstdporstd'` returns `3` because 'std' appears three times.
- The input `'truststdsolensporsd'` returns `1`.
- The input `'makestdsostdworthit'` returns `2` due to 'std' appearing twice.
- The input `'stds'` returns `1` as 'std' is at the beginning of the input.
- The input `'' ` returns `0`, as there are no occurrences of 'std' in an empty string.

Hence, the program does indeed fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
