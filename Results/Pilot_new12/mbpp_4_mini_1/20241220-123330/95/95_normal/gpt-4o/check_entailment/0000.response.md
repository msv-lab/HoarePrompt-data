Correctness: **True**.

The program defines a function `func_1` that counts the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` in a given string. It uses the built-in string method `count`, which correctly counts overlapping occurrences of the specified substring in the string.

All provided test cases return the expected results:
- `'letstdlenstdporstd'` has 3 occurrences of `'std'`.
- `'truststdsolensporsd'` has 1 occurrence of `'std'`.
- `'makestdsostdworthit'` has 2 occurrences of `'std'`.
- `'stds'` has 1 occurrence of `'std'`.
- An empty string `''` has 0 occurrences of `'std'`.

Since the function handles these test cases correctly and there are no edge cases that violate the problem description, the implementation is considered correct. Therefore, the result is `True`.
