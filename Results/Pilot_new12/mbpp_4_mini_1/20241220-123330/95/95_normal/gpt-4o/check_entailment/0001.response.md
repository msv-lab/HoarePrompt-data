Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. 

- The assertions provided check a variety of cases, including:
  - Multiple occurrences of 'std' (e.g., 'letstdlenstdporstd' yields 3).
  - A single occurrence of 'std' (e.g., 'truststdsolensporsd' yields 1).
  - Two occurrences of 'std' (e.g., 'makestdsostdworthit' yields 2).
  - A string containing just 'std' (e.g., 'stds' yields 1).
  - An empty string, which should return 0 occurrences.

The method `str.count(substring)` is used, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of 'std' within `s`. This method is appropriate for the task, and no edge cases have been overlooked by the provided assertions.

Since all the assertions pass and cover different scenarios, I find no instance where the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. Thus, the program functions correctly as intended.
