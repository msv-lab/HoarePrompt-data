Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` by using the built-in `count` method of the string class. This method is designed to count non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring, which aligns perfectly with the task described in the problem.

Since the problem description states that the input will be a valid string and does not specify any constraints on string content or case sensitivity, the program fulfills the requirements without any exceptions or errors, as assumed. Thus, the program is considered correct.
