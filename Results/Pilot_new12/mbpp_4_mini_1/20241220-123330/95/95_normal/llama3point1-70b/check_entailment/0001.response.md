Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1(s)` that accurately counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. The method `s.count('std')` works correctly for all potential cases, including:

1. If the input string contains 'std' multiple times (e.g., "stdabcstdxyz"), the function will return the correct count (2).
2. If the input string does not contain 'std' at all (e.g., "abcdef"), it will return 0, which is the correct behavior.
3. If the input string is empty (e.g., ""), it will also return 0, as there are no occurrences of 'std' in an empty string.
4. The function is case-sensitive, meaning it will not count 'Std', 'STD', or 'sTd', which complies with a common interpretation of counting substrings unless specified otherwise.

Since the function correctly handles all of these scenarios without any missing logic, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the function is correct for all expected inputs.
