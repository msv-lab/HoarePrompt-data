Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the counting of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string using the built-in string method `count()`. This method handles overlapping occurrences, case sensitivity, and returns the correct count for any input string. Therefore, I cannot identify any potential cases where the program would not work as expected based on the given problem description.
