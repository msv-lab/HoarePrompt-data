The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and computes the sum of its digits. It utilizes a while loop to extract each digit by using the modulus operation and adding it to a total sum. The loop continues until all digits have been processed, ultimately terminating when `n` becomes zero. The function then returns the total sum of the digits. If `n` is initially zero, the function will return zero. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which may lead to unintended behavior if such inputs are passed.
