The variable `n` is modified by the statement `n //= 10`, which performs an integer division of `n` by `10`. Since `n` is initially greater than `0`, this operation reduces `n` to the value of `n` divided by `10`. The `total` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. 

The specific value of `n` after the operation depends on its initial value, but since we only know that `n` must be greater than `0`, we can express the new value as `n // 10`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this relationship.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10); `n` is now equal to `n // 10`**
