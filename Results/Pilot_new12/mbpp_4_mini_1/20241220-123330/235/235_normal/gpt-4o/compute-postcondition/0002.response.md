The value of `total` is updated by adding the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 9 (inclusive). Thus, `total` will now be equal to the value of `n % 10` since `total` was initially 0. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`**
