The variable `n` is being modified by the operation `n //= 10`, which performs integer division of `n` by 10 and assigns the result back to `n`. This changes the value of `n` while the value of `total` remains equal to `n % 10`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 initially, after the operation, `n` will take on a new value which is `n // 10`, making it at least 0 after the operation (if `n` was originally 1-9, `n` will become 0). 

The value of `total` remains the same, calculated as the remainder when the original `n` is divided by 10.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `total` is equal to the original `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `total` is equal to the original `n % 10`.**
