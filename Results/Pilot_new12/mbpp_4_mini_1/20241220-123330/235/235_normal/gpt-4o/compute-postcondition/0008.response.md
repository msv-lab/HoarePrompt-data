The value of `total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to it. The initial value of `total` is `2 * (n % 10)`. Therefore, after the operation, `total` will equal `2 * (n % 10) + (n % 10)` which simplifies to `3 * (n % 10)`.

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and greater than 0, `n` will be a positive integer, and `total` will now be 3 times the last digit of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to `3 * (n % 10)`; `n` must be greater than 0**.
