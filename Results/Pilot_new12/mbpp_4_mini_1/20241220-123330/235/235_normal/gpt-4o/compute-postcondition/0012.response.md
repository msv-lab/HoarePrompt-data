The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is 0, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`. Since `n` is 0, the sum of its digits is also 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of its digits, which is 0 when `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns the sum of the digits of n, which is 0 if n is 0.**
