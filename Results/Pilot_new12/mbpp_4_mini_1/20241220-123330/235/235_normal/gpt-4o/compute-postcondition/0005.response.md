The code `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the remainder of `n` divided by 10 to it. Given the initial state that `total` is equal to the original `n % 10`, it indicates that total starts at the value of the last digit of `n`. After the execution, `total` becomes `total + (n % 10)`, which is effectively `n % 10 + n % 10`, or `2 * (n % 10)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10)`**.
