According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must currently be greater than 0. Therefore, the state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure this condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is equal to the original `n % 10`**
