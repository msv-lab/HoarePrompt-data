According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. So `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
