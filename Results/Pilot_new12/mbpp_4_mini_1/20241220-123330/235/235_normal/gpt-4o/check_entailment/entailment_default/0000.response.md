Explanation: The code appears to be correct because it computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` iteratively extracts each digit by using the modulus operation and adds it to the total sum, continuing until the integer `n` becomes zero. The output hints confirm this logic, stating that the function works for non-negative integers and references how it processes the digits correctly. Additionally, with the provided assertions for test cases, the function returns the expected results. As the function also handles the case when `n` is zero by returning zero, there are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the code fails according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
