Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, but it does not handle the edge case when `n` is zero, even though the description indicates it should return zero for that input. If `func_1(0)` is passed, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return an uninitialized value, which leads to incorrect behavior. 

Additionally, from the output hints, the note states that the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which implies that the function is not robust to invalid inputs per the original problem statement that limits the input type to non-negative integers. Since the program fails with at least one specific input (zero), it is incorrect.
