Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input `n` is 0. According to the problem description, the function should return the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, and since the input can be non-negative, it should also include the case of 0. 

In the provided program, when `n` is 0, the loop `while n > 0:` does not execute, and the function ultimately returns `total`, which remains 0. This is indeed correct for the input `0` since the sum of its digits (which is just 0) is correctly considered. However, the comments in the code imply that `total` should represent the sum of digits of the "original value of `n`", which might cause confusion when interpreted without context.

The other tested cases (`345`, `12`, and `97`) are correct and return the expected sums of their digits. However, since there is a lack of clarity and specifically correct handling of the case when `n` is `0`, which is a critical point of non-negative integers, we conclude that the program does not correctly meet the problem requirements in a clear and explicit manner.

Therefore, while it correctly calculates the sum of digits for valid inputs, the overall implementation and handling of input, especially edge cases like `0`, leads to ambiguity and potential insufficient correctness that is not in line with the stated problem description.
