You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to handle non-negative integers, but there is no handling for the case when `n` is 0. Based on the provided assertions, the function should return 0 for `func_1(0)`, but it is not tested or accounted for in the program. 

Here's the issue:
- If `n` is 0, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return 0, which is correct. However, since there are no assertions or tests for this case, it implies a lack of completeness in verifying all potential inputs as per the problem description.

Thus, while the function operates correctly for positive integers and indeed returns the correct sum for them, testing should explicitly cover the case of 0 to ensure the implementation meets the problem's requirements in every scenario. Hence, the program is considered incorrect given the incomplete assertions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and computes the sum of its digits. It utilizes a while loop to extract each digit by using the modulus operation and adding it to a total sum. The loop continues until all digits have been processed, ultimately terminating when `n` becomes zero. The function then returns the total sum of the digits. If `n` is initially zero, the function will return zero. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which may lead to unintended behavior if such inputs are passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
