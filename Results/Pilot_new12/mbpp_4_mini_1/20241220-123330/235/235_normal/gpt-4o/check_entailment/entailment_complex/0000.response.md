Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program specifically states that `n` is a non-negative integer at the start. Since we assume the inputs will always be valid as per the problem description, it does not shield against invalid inputs, but this aligns with the assumption.

2. **Logic of Summing Digits**: The function employs a while loop that continues until `n` becomes zero. Within the loop:
   - It uses `n % 10` to retrieve the last digit of `n`.
   - This digit is added to `total`.
   - Then, it updates `n` by performing integer division `n //= 10`, effectively removing the last digit.

3. **Termination and Return Value**: Once the loop completes (when `n` is zero), `total` by that point accumulates the sum of all the digits of the original number `n`. The function properly returns this sum.

4. **Behavior for Specific Cases**:
   - For `n = 0`: The loop does not execute, and the function correctly returns `0`, which is the sum of the digits of the number.
   - For other valid non-negative integers: The loop operates as described, computing and accumulating the digit sum correctly.

Since all steps within the function align with the problem requirements, the program is deemed correct by fulfilling its intended purpose without any discrepancies or missed scenarios.
