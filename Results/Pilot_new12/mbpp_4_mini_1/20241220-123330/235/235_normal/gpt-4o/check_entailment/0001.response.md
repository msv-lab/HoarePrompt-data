Correctness: **False**

The program as defined does not handle the case where the input is 0. According to the problem description, the function should be able to handle non-negative integers, including 0. The expected output when the input is 0 should be 0, since the sum of the digits of 0 is indeed 0. However, the provided assertions do not cover this edge case, and thus the function as currently implemented would not return the correct result for that input. 

For example:
```python
assert func_1(0) == 0  # This case is missing and the function would return 0 correctly, 
```
but it is not tested, highlighting that the program does not comprehensively satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem description.
