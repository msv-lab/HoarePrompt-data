Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified an important issue with the completeness of the program's assertions. While the function `func_1` does correctly compute the sum of the digits for non-negative integers, including zero, the absence of an explicit assertion or test case for `func_1(0)` does represent a lack of thorough validation of the functionality as per the problem description. It's essential to cover all potential input scenarios to fully confirm that the implementation meets the stated requirements. Thus, the program fails to demonstrate comprehensive correctness due to insufficient testing, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect based on the original assessment.
