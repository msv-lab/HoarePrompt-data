Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to handle non-negative integers, but there is no handling for the case when `n` is 0. Based on the provided assertions, the function should return 0 for `func_1(0)`, but it is not tested or accounted for in the program. 

Here's the issue:
- If `n` is 0, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return 0, which is correct. However, since there are no assertions or tests for this case, it implies a lack of completeness in verifying all potential inputs as per the problem description.

Thus, while the function operates correctly for positive integers and indeed returns the correct sum for them, testing should explicitly cover the case of 0 to ensure the implementation meets the problem's requirements in every scenario. Hence, the program is considered incorrect given the incomplete assertions.
