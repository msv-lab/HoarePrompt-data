The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** because it did not explicitly test for the case when `n` is 0. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the function `func_1` correctly handles the case where `n` is 0. The while loop is skipped, and `total`, which is initialized to 0, is returned. This behavior is in line with the problem description that specifies the function should return the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, including when that integer is 0.

The annotated code confirms this: 

1. It notes that the state of the program before the function call ensures `n` is a non-negative integer.
2. It specifies that after the loop (which does not execute if `n` is 0), the `total` is returned correctly as 0.

Thus, the original assessment mistakenly concluded that the lack of assertions for the case of `n=0` indicated a failure in the program's correctness. However, the implementation itself is valid and returns the correct output even for `n=0`. The assertions provided in the code are sufficient to cover the positive integers, and the function's logic for `n=0` is sound and adheres to the problem description.

Therefore, given this analysis and the supporting annotations, the program meets the problem description effectively in all cases.

Final: **True**
