Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the summation of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. The function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. It converts the integer `n` into a string using `str(n)`, allowing iteration over each character (which corresponds to each digit).
3. It then converts each character back to an integer and sums these integers using the `sum()` function and a generator expression.

This method effectively handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases such as:
- `0` (returns `0`)
- `9` (returns `9`)
- `123` (returns `6`, as `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`)

Since the function follows the problem description and handles edge cases correctly, I conclude that it is implemented correctly. There are no potential cases found where this code would not work as expected. Thus, the program behaves as required for every potential input.
