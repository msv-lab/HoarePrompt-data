Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function processes a non-negative integer (`n`) by converting it to a string to iterate over each digit, converting each character back to an integer, and then summing them up using the `sum()` function. There are no logical errors, and the implementation adheres to the problem requirements with valid assumptions about input validity.
