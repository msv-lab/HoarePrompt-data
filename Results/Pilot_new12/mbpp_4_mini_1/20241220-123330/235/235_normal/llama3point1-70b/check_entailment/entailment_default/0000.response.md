The given program is designed to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. 

### Explanation:
1. The program defines the function `func_1(n)`, which accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. It converts `n` to a string so that it can iterate over each character (which represents a digit).
3. Each character is converted back to an integer, and the sum of these integers is returned.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 0, returning a sum of 0, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- The function works correctly for any non-negative integer. When `n` is 0, it sums the digits (which are none) and returns 0 as expected.
- There is no logic present to handle negative integers, but since the problem description specifies non-negative integers only, this behavior is appropriate for the provided input constraints.
- Additionally, the notes regarding the interpretation of each character as a digit contribute to confirming the function's accuracy.

Since the function performs correctly in every potential case outlined in the problem description and the constraints are respected, the program fulfills its requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
