Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer. The assumption in the problem description ensures that we do not need to handle cases for negative integers or invalid inputs.

2. **Conversion to String**: Inside the function, `str(n)` converts the non-negative integer `n` to its string representation, allowing us to iterate through each digit.

3. **Digit Extraction and Summation**: The generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` converts each character (digit) back to an integer and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.

4. **Output**: The function returns the sum of the digits, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to get the sum of the digits of `n`.

Since it accurately meets all aspects of the problem description without failing under the assumed input conditions, the function is deemed correct.
