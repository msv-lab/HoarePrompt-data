Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It does this by converting the integer to a string to iterate over each digit, converting each character back to an integer, and then summing them up using the `sum()` function. 

Since the problem specifies non-negative integers and the code handles all non-negative integers appropriately without any logical errors, it should correctly return the expected output for all cases. There are no edge cases or potential failures observed in the implementation as it adheres to the problem requirements.
