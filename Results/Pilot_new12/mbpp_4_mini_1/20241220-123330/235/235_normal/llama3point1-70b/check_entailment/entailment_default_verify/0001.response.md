Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The program correctly implements the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`, as described in the problem statement. It successfully converts the integer to a string, iterates through each character (digit), converts them back to integers, and sums them correctly using the `sum()` function and a generator expression.

The reasoning in the assessment is well-supported by the functionality outlined in the output hints, which confirm that:
1. The function can handle the special edge case of `0`, returning `0` as expected.
2. The function works as intended for any non-negative integer, as there is no logic required to handle negative integers according to the problem constraints.

Given this, the function fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the final correctness assessment stands as **True**.
