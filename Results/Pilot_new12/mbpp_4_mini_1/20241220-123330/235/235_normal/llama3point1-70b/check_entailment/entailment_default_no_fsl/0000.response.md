Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It adheres to the problem description, accepting a non-negative integer and returning the sum of its digits. The function converts the number to a string, iterates over each character (each representing a digit), converts those characters back to integers, and sums them up.

The output hints confirm that the function handles cases such as when `n` is 0, returning 0, which is correct since the sum of its digits is indeed 0. The description assures that the function is well-defined for all non-negative integers and does not require additional handling for negative integers or other invalid inputs, as the input is constrained to be non-negative integers based on the problem definition.

As there is no evidence of any edge cases or potential inputs not being handled correctly within the scope of non-negative integers, the function is deemed correct for every specified case.
