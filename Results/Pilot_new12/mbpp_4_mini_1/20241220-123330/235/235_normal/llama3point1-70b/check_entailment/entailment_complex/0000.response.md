Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description, which requires a function to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Below is an explanation of how the program fulfills that requirement:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1(n)` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is explicitly stated to be a non-negative integer.

2. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`, which allows the function to iterate over each character of the string representation, effectively iterating over each digit.

3. **Digit Conversion and Summation**: It employs a generator expression `int(digit) for digit in str(n)` to convert each character (digit) back to an integer. The `sum()` function then accumulates these integers, yielding the total sum of the digits.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` equals 0, since the sum of its digits results in 0.

5. **Well-Defined Behavior**: The explanation confirms that the function correctly adheres to the provided constraints, specifically the input being a non-negative integer, with no need for error handling for negative integers.

Overall, the logic is sound, and the program consistently produces the expected sum of the digits for any valid non-negative integer input. Thus, it satisfactorily meets the problem description.
