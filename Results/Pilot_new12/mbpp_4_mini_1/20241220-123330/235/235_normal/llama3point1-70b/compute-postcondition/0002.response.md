Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It converts `n` to a string to iterate over each character (representing a digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0, which correctly returns 0 since the sum of its digits is 0. The behavior is well-defined for any non-negative integer input, and there is no logic present to handle negative integers, but since the input is constrained to non-negative integers as per the parameter definition, this is not an issue.**
