Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Format**: The function `func_1` correctly takes a tuple of tuples as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Averaging Logic**: The function calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple:
   - It first determines the number of elements in the first inner tuple with `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`.
   - It initializes an empty list `averages` to store the results.
   - It iterates through each position (from 0 to `num_elements-1`). For each position `i`, it constructs a list of elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).
   - Then, it calculates the average for that position using `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

3. **Output Format**: The function correctly returns a list of floating-point averages, which is what the problem description specifies.

4. **Validations via Assertions**: The provided assertions check various cases and confirm that the function produces the expected outputs. All assertions pass, indicating that the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases.

Overall, the function has been designed correctly to meet the problem's requirements, hence the correctness assertion is **True**.
