You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the requirement and the code logic.

### Problem Description
The program needs to take a tuple of tuples and compute the average of values for each corresponding position. Each position in the result list should contain the average of the values extracted from all the input tuples at that position.

### Input Examples Provided
1. `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))` should yield averages `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`
2. `((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))` should yield averages `[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]`
3. `((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))` should yield averages `[305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]`

### Evaluating the Code
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])  # Assumes all inner tuples are of the same length
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):  # Iterates over the index of each position
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]  # Collects elements from each tuple at position i
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)  # Computes average
        averages.append(avg)  # Appends average to the results
    return averages
```

#### Potential Issues
1. **Assumption of Tuple Length**: The function assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If an input with tuples of different lengths is provided, this would cause an `IndexError`.
   - Example: `func_1(((1, 2), (2, 3, 4)))` would cause error because the second tuple has more elements than the first one.

2. **Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case when tuples are empty. If `func_1(())` is executed, it will also raise an error while trying to access `tuples[0]`.

Given the points above, the function has edge cases that are not handled. Specifically, it does not check for tuples of different lengths or for empty input.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case of tuples of different lengths or empty input, leading to potential runtime errors.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `averages` contains the averages of corresponding elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`; `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`.
    return averages
    #The program returns averages which contains the averages of corresponding elements from each inner tuple in tuples


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
