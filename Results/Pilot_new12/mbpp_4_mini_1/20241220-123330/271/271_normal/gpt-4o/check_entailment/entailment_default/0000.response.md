The provided program defines a function `func_1` that aims to compute the averages of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. The examples provided in the problem description clearly illustrate how the function should operate on valid input, yielding the correct averages.

However, the output hints indicate that the function may not handle all potential edge cases correctly. Specifically, the hints state that if the input `tuples` is empty or if the inner tuples are of variable lengths, the function may raise an error (e.g., an `IndexError`). 

The program does not account for these scenarios:
1. If `tuples` is empty, trying to access `tuples[0]` will lead to an `IndexError`.
2. If the inner tuples have varying lengths, trying to access an index that does not exist in one of the inner tuples will also result in an `IndexError`.

Since the function relies on the assumption that:
- There is at least one inner tuple,
- All inner tuples have the same length,

It does not explicitly protect against these potential issues.

Therefore, due to these shortcomings, we can conclude that the code does not satisfy the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
