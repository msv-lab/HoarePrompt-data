Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle certain potential cases as described in the output hints. Specifically:

1. If the input `tuples` is empty, the code will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access `tuples[0]` to determine the number of elements. The problem description does not state that the function will receive valid inputs only and does not specify that the input will not be empty.

2. If the inner tuples have varying lengths, the program will also raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access an index that does not exist in one of the inner tuples. The program currently assumes that all inner tuples are of the same length without any checks.

Since the program fails to handle these cases correctly, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
