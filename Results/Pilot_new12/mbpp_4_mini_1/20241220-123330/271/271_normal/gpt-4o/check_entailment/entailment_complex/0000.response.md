Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` accurately follows the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a tuple of tuples as input, which matches the specified data structure in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Averages**: The function correctly computes the average for each position across the inner tuples. It iterates over the range of the number of elements in the inner tuples, collects the corresponding elements from each tuple, and computes the average for that position. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to return a list of averages.

3. **Accurate Output**: The results are confirmed by existing assertions which check the correctness of specific cases. Each assertion verifies that the actual output matches the expected output, ensuring functionality.

4. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The problem description assumes valid input will be provided. The program does not explicitly handle malformed input or variable-length inner tuples, but it is assumed that all inner tuples have equal length, per the problem constraints.

Overall, since the function behaves as described in the problem description and consistently produces the correct averages for valid input, it meets the correctness criteria.
