To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the requirement and the code logic.

### Problem Description
The program needs to take a tuple of tuples and compute the average of values for each corresponding position. Each position in the result list should contain the average of the values extracted from all the input tuples at that position.

### Input Examples Provided
1. `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))` should yield averages `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`
2. `((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))` should yield averages `[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]`
3. `((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))` should yield averages `[305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]`

### Evaluating the Code
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])  # Assumes all inner tuples are of the same length
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):  # Iterates over the index of each position
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]  # Collects elements from each tuple at position i
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)  # Computes average
        averages.append(avg)  # Appends average to the results
    return averages
```

#### Potential Issues
1. **Assumption of Tuple Length**: The function assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If an input with tuples of different lengths is provided, this would cause an `IndexError`.
   - Example: `func_1(((1, 2), (2, 3, 4)))` would cause error because the second tuple has more elements than the first one.

2. **Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case when tuples are empty. If `func_1(())` is executed, it will also raise an error while trying to access `tuples[0]`.

Given the points above, the function has edge cases that are not handled. Specifically, it does not check for tuples of different lengths or for empty input.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case of tuples of different lengths or empty input, leading to potential runtime errors.
