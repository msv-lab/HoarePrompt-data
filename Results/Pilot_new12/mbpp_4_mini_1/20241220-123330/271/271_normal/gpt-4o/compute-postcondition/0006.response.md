To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information.

1. We have `i = 0` at the end of the previous iteration, and `num_elements` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.
2. The loop runs for `i` in the range of `num_elements`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`.
3. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` will become 1 in the next iteration.
4. The state of `elements_at_position` is mentioned and it's derived from the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`. This does not change in this step of the analysis.
5. `avg` is calculated using `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which remains part of the previous context but doesn't affect the loop control.

Thus, for the next iteration:
- `i` will become 1.
- `num_elements` has to remain greater than 1 for the loop to run at least one more time.

Taking all this into account, we update the states accordingly:

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 1; `averages` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
