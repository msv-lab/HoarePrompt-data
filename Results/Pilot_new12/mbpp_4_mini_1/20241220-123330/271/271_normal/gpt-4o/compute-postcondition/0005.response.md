The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The `avg` has already been calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Therefore, the content of the `averages` list is updated but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 0; `averages` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
