The value of `num_elements` is assigned the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`. The output state will reflect that `num_elements` is equal to the number of numeric values in that first inner tuple, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and `num_elements` is equal to the length of the first inner tuple.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`.**
