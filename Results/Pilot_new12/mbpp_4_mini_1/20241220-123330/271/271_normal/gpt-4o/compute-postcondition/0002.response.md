According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. The loop will execute if `num_elements` is greater than 0. If `num_elements` is 0, the loop will not run at all. At the start of the loop, the index `i` will be initialized to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
