Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains numeric values. It calculates and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty or if the inner tuples are of variable length, the function may raise an error (e.g., IndexError), as it assumes all inner tuples are of the same length and that `tuples` contains at least one inner tuple. The final state returns a list of corresponding element averages, but does not handle cases where input might be malformed or empty.**
