To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables provided in the initial state.

1. The variable `elements_at_position` is a list that contains the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`. 
2. The variable `len(tuples)` gives the count of tuples in the `tuples` tuple, and since `num_elements` is greater than 2, this implies that `len(tuples)` is also greater than 2.
3. The sum of the elements in `elements_at_position` is calculated by the function `sum(elements_at_position)`, resulting in a numerical value that represents the total of those elements. 
4. The division `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` calculates the average of the second elements, and this average is stored in `avg`.

Since `averages` includes previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`, this implies `averages` will be updated to include this computed average as a new element.

The Output State after executing the code will update the values affected by the calculations:

- `avg` is assigned the value `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which is a specific numeric value.
- `averages` will now also contain `avg` as a new element.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; `averages` includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 2.**
