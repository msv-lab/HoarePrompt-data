The code appends `avg` to the `averages` list. The value of `avg` is computed as the sum of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples` divided by the number of tuples present. Since `num_elements` must be greater than 1, it ensures that the operation is valid. The previous values of `tuples`, `num_elements`, `i`, and `elements_at_position` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 1; `averages` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is now equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; `averages` now includes the new element `avg`.**
