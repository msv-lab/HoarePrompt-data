The list comprehension `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]` creates a new list containing the `i`-th element from each tuple in the `tuples`. Since `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` must also be a valid index for the elements in the tuples.

Given that `i` is 0 and `num_elements` is more than 0, we can assume that each tuple in `tuples` has at least one element. 

The output will contain a new list `elements_at_position` with the first element (index 0) from each tuple in `tuples`.

The other variables (`tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
