The code takes the `i`-th element from each tuple in `tuples` and assigns this list to `elements_at_position`. Since `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, which means we are accessing the second element of each tuple in `tuples`. The previous state of the variables is preserved except for `elements_at_position`, which will now contain the second values from each tuple.

Let's analyze the impact:
- `elements_at_position` is now populated with the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 1; `averages` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
