The value of `avg` is assigned the result of `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Given that `elements_at_position` is a list consisting of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, we can conclude that `len(tuples)` is greater than 1, ensuring that we have valid input for the calculation. The sum of the second elements will yield a number that, when divided by the number of tuples, results in `avg`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 1; `averages` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`, `i` is 1; `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is now equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
