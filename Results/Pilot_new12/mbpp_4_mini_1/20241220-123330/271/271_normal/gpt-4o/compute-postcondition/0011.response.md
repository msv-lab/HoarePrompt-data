The code creates a list called `elements_at_position` by extracting the second element (index 2) from each tuple in the `tuples` tuple of tuples. Since `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and `i` is given as 2, `elements_at_position` will now hold the second elements from all the tuples in `tuples`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `averages` includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `avg`; `i` is 2; `elements_at_position` is now a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
