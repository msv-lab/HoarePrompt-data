    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples; `averages` contains the averages of corresponding elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`; `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`.
    return averages
    #The program returns averages which contains the averages of corresponding elements from each inner tuple in tuples
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains numeric values. It calculates and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty or if the inner tuples are of variable length, the function may raise an error (e.g., IndexError), as it assumes all inner tuples are of the same length and that `tuples` contains at least one inner tuple. The final state returns a list of corresponding element averages, but does not handle cases where input might be malformed or empty.
