#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages calculated from the numerical values in the tuple of tuples, where each average is derived from the sum of the corresponding elements across the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains numerical values. It returns a list of averages calculated from the numerical values across the inner tuples. Each average is derived from the sum of the corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples. If the input contains empty tuples or if the input is empty, a division by zero error may occur. The function does not handle such edge cases.
