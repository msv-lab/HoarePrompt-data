The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values. After executing the function body, it returns a list of averages calculated from the numerical values in the tuple of tuples. Each average is derived from the sum of the corresponding elements across the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages based on those values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages calculated from those values.**
