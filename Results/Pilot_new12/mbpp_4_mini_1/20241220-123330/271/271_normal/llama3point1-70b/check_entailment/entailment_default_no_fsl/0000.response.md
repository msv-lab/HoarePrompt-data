Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle edge cases as mentioned in the output hints. Specifically, if the input `tuples` is an empty tuple or contains empty inner tuples, the code will result in a division by zero error since it attempts to compute the average by dividing by `len(tuples)`, which would be zero in those cases. 

For example:
- If `tuples = ()` (an empty tuple), the program will throw a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If `tuples = ((), ())` (two empty inner tuples), the program will also throw a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Since the program fails to manage these cases, it does not fulfill the problem description for every potential input scenario. Thus, it is incorrect.
