Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input tuples are empty. If we pass an empty tuple of tuples to the function, it will result in a division by zero when trying to compute the average since `len(tuples)` would be 0. Thus, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. 

For example:
```python
func_1(())  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
``` 

This demonstrates that the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
