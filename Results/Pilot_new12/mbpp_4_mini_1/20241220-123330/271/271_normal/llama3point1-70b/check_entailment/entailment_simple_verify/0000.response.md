The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case of empty input tuples, resulting in a potential `ZeroDivisionError`. This conclusion is supported by the observation that when the function `func_1` is called with an empty tuple of tuples `func_1(())`, it will attempt to divide by zero, leading to an error.

The problem description requires that the function computes averages from a tuple of tuples. While the function correctly computes the average for valid non-empty input, it fails when the input is empty, which indeed does not satisfy the requirements of the problem as stated.

The annotated version of the code corroborates this point, acknowledging that the function is expected to calculate averages from numerical values in the inner tuples but does not specify handling for the case of empty inputs. Thus, it implies an implicit assumption that the input will always be valid, which is not addressed in the assessment of correctness.

Given that the assessment remains consistent with both the original claim and the behavior of the code, I will maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
