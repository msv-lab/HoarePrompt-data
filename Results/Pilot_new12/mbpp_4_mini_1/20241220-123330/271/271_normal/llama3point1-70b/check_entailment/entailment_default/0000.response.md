Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code aims to calculate the average of the corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle edge cases, such as when the input contains empty tuples or when the input itself is empty. If the input is a tuple of empty tuples, the code will attempt to compute the average of the values across these tuples, leading to a division by zero error since `len(tuples)` in this case would be zero. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirement of correctly handling every potential input case as specified in the problem description.
