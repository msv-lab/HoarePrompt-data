To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we can analyze the function and identify potential edge cases.

The problem description states that the function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided program:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Use of `zip(*tuples)`**: This is used to group (zip) the corresponding values from each tuple.
2. **Calculating Averages**: For each group, it computes the sum and divides by the number of tuples, which is the intended mechanism for calculating averages.
3. **Division by Zero**: A potential edge case arises if the input is an empty tuple, which causes `len(tuples)` to be zero. This would lead to a division by zero error.

### Edge Case:
- **Input**: `()`
  - **Expected Output**: Since there are no tuples to average, perhaps an empty list `[]` could be considered reasonable.
  - **Actual Behavior**: The code will throw a `ZeroDivisionError` because `len(tuples)` will be 0.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where it is passed an empty tuple.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program fails to return a valid output for an empty input tuple, leading to a runtime error.
