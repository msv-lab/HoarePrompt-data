Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Type**: The function takes a single argument `tuples`, which is specified as a tuple of tuples, and this is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Computation of Averages**: 
   - The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to iterate over the values at each position across all inner tuples. This transposes the tuple of tuples, making it easy to access corresponding elements for averaging.
   - It then uses a list comprehension to compute the average of these corresponding values. For each value group, it calculates the sum and divides by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`) to obtain the average.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a list of these averages, which is exactly what the problem description specifies.

In summary, the function meets all the specified requirements and processes the input correctly to return the desired output. Thus, the implementation can be considered correct according to the problem description.
