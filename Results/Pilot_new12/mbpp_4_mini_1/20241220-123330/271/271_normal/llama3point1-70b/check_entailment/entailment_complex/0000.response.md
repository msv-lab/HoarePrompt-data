Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's how it does so:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is specified to be a tuple of tuples. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Calculation of Averages**: The core task required by the problem is to compute the average of corresponding values from each inner tuple. The program achieves this through the use of the `zip(*tuples)` which effectively transposes the tuple of tuples. This means that it groups the first elements of all inner tuples together, the second elements together, and so on. The use of a list comprehension then allows for the calculation of the average for each group by summing the values of these grouped elements and dividing by the number of inner tuples.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns a list containing the computed averages, which aligns with the output format specified in the problem description.

4. **Division Safety**: Although the annotations mention that the function does not handle edge cases like empty tuples or empty input, it also specifies that valid input will be provided. This means we can assume when the function is called, it will always receive a valid tuple of tuples that does not lead to division by zero, thus conforming to the expectations laid out in the problem description.

As such, the function correctly implements the required functionality defined in the problem description, resulting in Correctness: **True**.
