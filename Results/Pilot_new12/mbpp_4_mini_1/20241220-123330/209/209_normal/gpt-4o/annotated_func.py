#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-empty lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty list in 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of non-empty lists. It returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`. However, if any sublist is empty, this will raise an `IndexError`, as there is no handling of such edge cases within the function. Therefore, as it stands, the function assumes all sublists are non-empty, and this assumption may lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to this expectation.
