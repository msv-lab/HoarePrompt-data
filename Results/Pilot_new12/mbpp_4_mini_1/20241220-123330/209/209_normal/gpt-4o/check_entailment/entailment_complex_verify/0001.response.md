The original assessment correctly identifies the potential flaws in the function `func_1` regarding handling edge cases such as empty sublists. The problem description requires a function that retrieves the first element of each sublist from a list of lists, but it does not explicitly state that all sublists must be non-empty or that input validation is required.

The annotated version of the program further clarifies that the function as it currently stands does not include mechanisms to handle empty sublists, which will lead to `IndexError` if invoked with such a case. Despite the assumption that the input will always be valid, the function remains inherently flawed because it does not safeguard against these edge cases.

After reviewing the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations regarding the behavior of `func_1`, it is clear that:

1. The function does not meet the problem description's requirements under all scenarios due to the lack of error handling for empty sublists.
2. The original assessment logically and correctly reasons that the program lacks correctness because of these unhandled edge cases.

Considering the above points, I conclude that the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **False**
