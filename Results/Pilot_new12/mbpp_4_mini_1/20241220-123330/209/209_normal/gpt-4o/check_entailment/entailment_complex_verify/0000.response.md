The original assessment identified that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where a sublist may be empty, which could lead to an `IndexError`. This is a valid concern because the program intends to get the first element of each sublist, and if any sublist is empty, the program will encounter a runtime error. 

The annotations also specify that the function expects `lst` to be a list of non-empty lists. However, since there is no implementation to ensure that all sublists are non-empty before attempting to access their first elements, the function's design is fundamentally flawed regarding this assumption. 

In light of the problem description, which requires the function to get the first element of each sublist, encountering an empty sublist violates the requirements because it leads to an error.

Given the information from the annotations and the original assessment, the function does not meet the problem description in all potential cases. The original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** remains accurate because the function does not handle the edge case of empty sublists properly.

Final: **False**
