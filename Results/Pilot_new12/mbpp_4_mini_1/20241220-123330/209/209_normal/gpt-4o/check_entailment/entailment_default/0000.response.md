Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of non-empty sublists. However, there is no error handling for the case when any sublist is empty. If the input contains an empty sublist (for example, `func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7]])`), it would raise an `IndexError` since it tries to access the first element of the empty list. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly when dealing with lists that contain empty sublists.
