Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description.

The problem description requires us to write a function that retrieves the first element of each sublist from a list of lists. 

The provided function, `func_1`, implements this logic using a list comprehension:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

This function will iterate over each `sublist` in `lst` and attempt to return the first element of each one (i.e., `sublist[0]`).

### Testing the function with provided examples:
1. For the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the expected output is `[1, 3, 6]`.
2. For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the expected output is `[1, 4]`.
3. For the input `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]`, the expected output is `[9, 1]`.

All of these assertions are valid for the corresponding inputs, but we need to consider potential edge cases to ensure the function handles all scenarios correctly.

### Edge case considerations:
1. **Empty sublists**: If any sublist is empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will cause an `IndexError`.
   - Example: For the input `[[1, 2], [], [6, 7]]`, the function will raise an error because the second sublist is empty.
   
2. **Completely empty list**: If the main list is empty, the function should return an empty list without any errors.
   - Example: For the input `[]`, the expected output is `[]`, which would work correctly.
   
3. **Non-list elements within the main list**: If the main list contains types other than lists (like integers or strings), the function will also raise an error.
   - Example: For the input `[[1, 2], "not a list", [6, 7]]`, it will raise a `TypeError` when it tries to treat the string as a list.

4. **Sublist with a single element**: Although it works as expected for a sublist with a single element, we don't have this weight in mind directly as an edge case.

Given these considerations, the function is incorrect since it will fail when encountering an empty sublist or a non-list element within the input list. 

### Conclusion
Based on the issues identified, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases defined by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: The function throws an IndexError when it tries to access the first element of an empty sublist.
