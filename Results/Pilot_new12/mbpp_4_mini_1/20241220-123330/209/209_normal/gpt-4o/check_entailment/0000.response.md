To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to consider if it handles all potential cases, particularly edge cases.

The program is designed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of lists. The example assertions provided highlight some typical cases:

1. `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`
2. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`
3. `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`

The current implementation of the function extracts the first element from each sublist using a list comprehension.

However, consider the case when one of the sublists is empty:

```python
assert func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) 
```

This will raise an `IndexError` since `sublist[0]` will not find an element in the empty sublist.

As this edge case shows that the program fails when there are empty sublists, this demonstrates that the function does not conform to the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
