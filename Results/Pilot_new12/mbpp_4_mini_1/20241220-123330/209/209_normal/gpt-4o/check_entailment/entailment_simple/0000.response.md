Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that it should return the first element of each sublist from a given list of non-empty lists. The function `func_1` employs a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst`, extracting the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist. 

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function correctly outputs a list containing the first elements from a variety of valid input cases. The examples provided in the assertions show that regardless of the specific contents of the sublists (as long as they are non-empty), the function will always return a correct list of first elements.

Since the program assumes the input will always be valid (non-empty lists), there are no edge cases or potential errors that would cause it to fail under the provided assumptions. Thus, it fulfills the task as described in the problem statement.
