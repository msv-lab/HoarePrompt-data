Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It is designed to return the first element of each sublist contained within a list of non-empty lists. Here are the reasons supporting this conclusion:

1. **Input Assumption**: The `func_1` function assumes that its input is a list (`lst`) containing non-empty sublists. According to the outline, we also operate under the assumption that users provide valid input, meaning we expect `lst` to always contain non-empty lists.

2. **Implementation**: The core of the function uses a list comprehension:
   ```python
   return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
   ```
   This code effectively gathers the first element of each sublist and constructs a new list that consists of these elements.

3. **Verification**: The provided assertions serve as tests and confirm that the function behaves as intended for different valid inputs:
   - For the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the output is `[1, 3, 6]`, which is correct.
   - For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the output is `[1, 4]`, which is correct.
   - For the input `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]`, the output is `[9, 1]`, which is correct.

Each assertion validates that the function consistently extracts the first element of each sublist accurately.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Although the function does not explicitly handle edge cases (like empty sublists), it is stated (and assumed) that input will always conform to the expected format. Given this assumption, the lack of handling for empty sublists does not disqualify the function from being correct as per the requirements.

In conclusion, the implementation correctly follows the problem description and will yield the expected results for valid inputs as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
