Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of empty sublists, which will lead to an `IndexError` if such a sublist is present. The output hints explicitly mention this oversight, indicating that the function expects all sublists to be non-empty. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7]])`, the function would attempt to access the first element of the empty sublist and raise an `IndexError`. This demonstrates that the program is incorrect as it does not provide the expected behavior for all potential cases, particularly when encountering empty sublists.
