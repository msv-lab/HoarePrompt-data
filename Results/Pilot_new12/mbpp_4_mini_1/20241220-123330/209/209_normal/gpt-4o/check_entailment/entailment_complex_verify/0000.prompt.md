You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to consider if it handles all potential cases, particularly edge cases.

The program is designed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of lists. The example assertions provided highlight some typical cases:

1. `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`
2. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`
3. `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`

The current implementation of the function extracts the first element from each sublist using a list comprehension.

However, consider the case when one of the sublists is empty:

```python
assert func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) 
```

This will raise an `IndexError` since `sublist[0]` will not find an element in the empty sublist.

As this edge case shows that the program fails when there are empty sublists, this demonstrates that the function does not conform to the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-empty lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty list in 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of non-empty lists. It returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`. However, if any sublist is empty, this will raise an `IndexError`, as there is no handling of such edge cases within the function. Therefore, as it stands, the function assumes all sublists are non-empty, and this assumption may lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to this expectation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
