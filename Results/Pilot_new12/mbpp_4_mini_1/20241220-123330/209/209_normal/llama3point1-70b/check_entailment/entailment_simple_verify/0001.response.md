Based on the provided information, the original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case of empty sublists, which could lead to an `IndexError`. However, the annotated version explicitly states the assumption that "sublists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one element." This assumption contradicts the original assessment's concern about handling empty sublists.

Given that the problem description does not specify any requirements regarding the handling of empty sublists and the annotated code clarifies that it operates under the assumption that all sublists will contain at least one element, the program functions as intended. The behavior as described in the annotations aligns with the problem's requirements.

As such, the reasoning behind the original assessment is no longer applicable, since it relies on scenarios that the annotated version states will not occur under the expected input conditions.

Final: **True**
