Correctness: **False**

The given function `func_1` attempts to retrieve the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists. However, it does not handle the potential case where a sublist may be empty. 

For example, if the input is:
```python
sublists = [[], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
```
Then `func_1` will throw an `IndexError` when it tries to access `sublist[0]` for the first empty sublist, which is not specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not correctly address all potential scenarios.

Thus, since the program fails for at least one input case, the correctness is deemed false.
