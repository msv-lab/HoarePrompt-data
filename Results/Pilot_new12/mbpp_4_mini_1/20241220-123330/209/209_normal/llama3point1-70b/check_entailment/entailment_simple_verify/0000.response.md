The program implements the requirement to retrieve the first element of each sublist correctly, under the assumption indicated in the annotated version. The annotation specifies that "sublists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one element."

Considering this assumption, the original assessment's concern about empty sublists does not apply because the annotated version guarantees the presence of at least one element in every sublist. As a result, the function will not encounter an `IndexError` in this scenario.

Hence, the program meets the problem description requirements, as it retrieves the first element of each sublist correctly when input under the specified conditions.

Since the original assessment highlighted a valid concern about the function's performance with empty sublists but did not consider the given assumptions, there is a misalignment. Under the assured conditions described in the annotations, the program's behavior is indeed correct.

Therefore, maintaining the correctness conclusion based on these considerations leads us to:

Final: **True**
