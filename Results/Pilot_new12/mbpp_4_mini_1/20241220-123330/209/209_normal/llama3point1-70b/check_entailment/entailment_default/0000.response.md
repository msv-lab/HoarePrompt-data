Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` assumes that every sublist in the input `sublists` contains at least one element. However, if any sublist is empty, accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For instance, if the input is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the function would raise an error when it attempts to access the first element of the empty sublist. The output hints confirm this limitation, indicating that error handling is needed for cases where `sublists` contains empty sublists. Thus, the function does not handle every potential case correctly, leading to its classification as incorrect.
