Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to handle a list of lists and return the first element of each sublist. However, it does not consider cases where any of the sublists might be empty or if the main list itself is empty. If an empty sublist is provided, the code will raise an IndexError when it tries to access `sublist[0]`. 

For example:
- If the input is `[[], [1, 2, 3]]`, the program will attempt to access the first element of the empty sublist `[]`, leading to an error.
- If the input is `[]` (an empty list), the program would not handle this case and would not return a valid result.

Thus, the program does not adequately handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
