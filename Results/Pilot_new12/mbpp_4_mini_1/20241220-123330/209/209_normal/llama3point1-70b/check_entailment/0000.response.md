To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program in detail.

### Problem Description
The goal is to write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Analysis
1. **Basic Case**: If `sublists` contains multiple sublists, such as `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, the output would be `[1, 3, 5]`, which is correct.
2. **Empty Sublists**: The current implementation does not handle cases where a sublist is empty. For example, if `sublists` contains an empty sublist `[[1, 2], [], [5, 6]]`, this will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]` for the empty sublist.
3. **Completely Empty Input**: If `sublists` is completely empty (`[]`), the output should be `[]`, and this works as expected.
4. **Mix of Empty and Non-empty Sublists**: As mentioned before, any sublist that is empty will result in an error, which violates the function's purpose of safely retrieving the first element.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to handle the case of empty sublists and raises an exception in such instances, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where a sublist may be empty, resulting in an `IndexError`, which fails the requirements of the problem description.
