Based on the provided problem description, program code, original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, here is the refined assessment of the program's correctness:

1. **Problem Description**: The objective is to write a function that retrieves the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists (sublists).

2. **Program Analysis**: The provided program:
   ```python
   def func_1(sublists):
       return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
   ```
   This function attempts to return the first element of each sublist.

3. **State of Annotation**: The annotations clarify that the function is designed to handle cases where each sublist contains at least one element, and it lacks error handling for empty sublists or the scenario where `sublists` itself is empty. As per the annotation:
   - It states that the function assumes all sublists will contain at least one element. If that assumption holds true, the function behaves as expected.
   - If an empty sublist or an entirely empty `sublists` is passed, an `IndexError` will occur, which is echoed in the original assessment.

4. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect, primarily on the grounds that it fails to handle empty sublists and will raise an `IndexError`. This reasoning holds true as per the evaluation of the program and the annotations provided.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the program does not meet the requirements to handle sublists that might be empty, the original assessment remains accurate. 

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
