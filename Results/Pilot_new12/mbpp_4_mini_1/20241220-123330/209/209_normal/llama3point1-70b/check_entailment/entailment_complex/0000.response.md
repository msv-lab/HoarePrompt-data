Correctness: **True**

The annotated program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists called `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The assumption that each sublist contains at least one element is explicitly stated in both the function and its annotations, which means that the function implementation is aligned with the problem's intent.

Since the problem description requires that the function should get the first element of each sublist, and the program correctly implements that behavior using a list comprehension, we can conclude that it satisfies the requirements. The program handles the scenario where each sublist is non-empty effectively, and since valid input is assumed, we are not concerned with potential errors such as `IndexError`.

In summary, the program correctly extracts the first element from each sublist as required by the problem description, given that the input will always adhere to the specified assumptions (each sublist being non-empty). Therefore, the correctness of the program stands validated as true.
