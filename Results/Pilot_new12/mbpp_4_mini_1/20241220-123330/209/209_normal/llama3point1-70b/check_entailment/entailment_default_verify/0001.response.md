Final: **False**

The original assessment that the correctness of the program is false is accurate. The function `func_1` attempts to access the first element of each sublist, but it does not account for the possibility of empty sublists. As pointed out in the assessment, if any sublist is empty, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will result in an `IndexError`. The output hints confirm this limitation by stating that the function assumes all sublists contain at least one element, which is a strong assumption that is not guaranteed. Therefore, since the function fails to handle situations where sublists may be empty or where `sublists` itself could be empty, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description.
