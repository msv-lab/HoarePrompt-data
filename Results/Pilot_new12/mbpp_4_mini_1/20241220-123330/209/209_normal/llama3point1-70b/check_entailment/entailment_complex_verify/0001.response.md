Based on the provided problem description, the objective is to write a Python function to retrieve the first element of each sublist. The original assessment deemed the program's correctness to be **False** due to concerns about the function's behavior when handling empty sublists.

Looking closely at the annotated version of the code, it indicates that the function `func_1` indeed assumes that each sublist will contain at least one element. The statement right before the function indicates that `sublists` is a list where each sublist has at least one element, which supports the idea that the function is crafted under the assumption that valid input will be provided. 

However, the original assessment points out a key flaw regarding input validation: if the function is provided with empty sublists or if the list itself is empty, it will throw an `IndexError`. The annotations explain this risk clearly and reinforce the fact that the function does not handle cases with empty sublists.

Given the assumption that the input will always adhere to the expected format—each sublist containing at least one element, as noted in the annotations—the function could be considered correct under this assumption. However, such assumptions generally remove the robustness expected in well-structured programs.

The original assessment is justified because if the user does not adhere to the assumption and provides an empty sublist, the function will indeed raise an error. Therefore, the potential for error with unspecified conditions aligns with the assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **False**
