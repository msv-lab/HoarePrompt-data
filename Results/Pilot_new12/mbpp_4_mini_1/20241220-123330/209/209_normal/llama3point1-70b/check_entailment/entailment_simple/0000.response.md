Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to get the first element of each sublist within a list of lists. The function `func_1(sublists)` utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each `sublist` in `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each of these sublists. 

Since the problem description specifies that each sublist contains at least one element, this implementation is valid and does not raise any errors. Additionally, the use of a list comprehension efficiently gathers the first elements as required. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description without any deviations or omissions.
