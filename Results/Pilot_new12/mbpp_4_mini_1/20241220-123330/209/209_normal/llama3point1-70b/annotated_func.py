#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one element.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from the list of lists 'sublists', where each sublist contains at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist from `sublists`. The function assumes that each sublist contains at least one element. However, there is no built-in error handling for cases where the input might not meet this assumption (e.g., if `sublists` is empty or if any sublist is empty), which may lead to an IndexError. Therefore, the final output state can be summarized as a list of the first elements of the non-empty sublists, provided the input fulfills the criteria. If there are empty sublists or if `sublists` is empty, the function may throw an error.
