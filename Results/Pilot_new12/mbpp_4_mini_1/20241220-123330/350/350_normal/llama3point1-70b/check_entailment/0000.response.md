Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It does this by iterating through the array in reverse order and checks each element to see if it matches the target. If found, it returns the index of the element; if not found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

Hereâ€™s why it works for every potential case:
1. If the target does not exist in the array, it correctly returns -1.
2. If the target exists multiple times, it will return the index of the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration.
3. The function handles edge cases, such as when the array is empty or when the target is at the start or end of the array.

Overall, it satisfies the problem requirements for all potential cases.
