Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is intended to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. While it does correctly search for the last occurrence of the `target` by iterating in reverse, it does not handle the edge case of an empty list `arr`. In such a case, the function would return -1, which is misleading, since it doesn't differentiate between the cases where the list is empty or where the target does not exist in a non-empty list.

For example, if `arr` is an empty list `[]` and the `target` is any integer (let's say `5`), the program will return `-1`, but this does not clearly indicate that the target doesn't exist due to the list being empty. Therefore, it fails to fulfil the requirement of providing a correct output for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
