The program correctly implements a function to find the last position of an element (the `target`) in a sorted array (the `arr`). 

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function iterates over the array from the last index to the first index, checking if the current element matches the `target`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the current index, ensuring that the last occurrence of the `target` is returned due to the reverse iteration.

2. **Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns -1, which is a standard way to indicate that the element is not found. 

3. **Sorted Array**: The problem states that the array will be sorted, and the approach taken by the function is still valid since the last occurrence of the `target` will be found correctly, if it exists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function operates according to the problem description and correctly handles cases where:
   - The `target` is in the array (returns the last index).
   - The `target` is not in the array (returns -1).
   - The array contains duplicate elements, returning the index of the last occurrence.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the program's functionality against that description, the function fulfills all necessary requirements to identify the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Correctness: **True**
