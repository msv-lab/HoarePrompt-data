The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

Examining the output hints, we see that the function iterates through `arr` in reverse to find the last occurrence of `target`. It correctly returns the index if it finds the `target`, and returns -1 if it doesn't.

However, the output hints also state that the function does not handle the case where `arr` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Yet, as per the assumptions given, we are to consider valid input only, which means that if an empty list is not a valid input type for this problem, and the function should ideally return -1 when called with an empty list. 

Considering the issue highlighted in the output hints, there is a potential for misunderstanding about what constitutes a valid input for this function. If we interpret the requirement strictly, the function does indeed need to correctly identify and return -1 for an empty list, which it does. Thus, from a problem-solving perspective, for valid lists provided, it delivers the expected output.

Since I could not find any example where the program fails to work correctly based on the assumptions of valid inputs, I conclude that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly finds the last index of the target element in a sorted array by searching in reverse order. It returns the appropriate index or -1 when the target is absent, which meets the problem requirements for valid input cases.
