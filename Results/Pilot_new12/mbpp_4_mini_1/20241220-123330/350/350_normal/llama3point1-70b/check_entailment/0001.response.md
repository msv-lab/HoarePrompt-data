Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order, checking for the target element. 

Here is a brief explanation of why the code works correctly:

1. The loop starts from the last index of the array and moves towards the first index. This means that the first instance of the target found during this iteration is the last occurrence in the sorted array.
2. If the target element is found, its index is returned immediately.
3. If the target is not found in the entire array, the function returns -1, which is the expected output for cases where the target is not present in the array.

The function handles all edge cases effectively:
- If the array is empty, it returns -1 (correct behavior).
- If the target occurs multiple times, it finds the last occurrence correctly by scanning backward.

Given all of the above, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
