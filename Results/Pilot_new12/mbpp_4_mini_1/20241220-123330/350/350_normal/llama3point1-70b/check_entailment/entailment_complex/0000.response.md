Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` iterates through the sorted list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element. This allows it to find the last occurrence of `target` efficiently.

2. **Return Values**: If it encounters the `target`, it returns the index immediately. If the loop completes without finding the `target`, it returns -1, which indicates that the element is not present in the array, as specified in the problem description.

3. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The problem states that we can assume that the input will be valid and will not cause errors. Therefore, the lack of explicit checks for empty lists or invalid types is acceptable per the assumption given.

4. **Sorted Input**: The function adheres to the specification that `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and since the function performs a linear search from the end, it will always correctly identify the last occurrence of `target`.

Overall, the function fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description and handles the task correctly by consistently returning either the last index of `target` or -1 when `target` is not found.
