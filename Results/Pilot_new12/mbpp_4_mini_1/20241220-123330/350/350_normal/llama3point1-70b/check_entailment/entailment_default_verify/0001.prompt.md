You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order, checking for the target element. 

Here is a brief explanation of why the code works correctly:

1. The loop starts from the last index of the array and moves towards the first index. This means that the first instance of the target found during this iteration is the last occurrence in the sorted array.
2. If the target element is found, its index is returned immediately.
3. If the target is not found in the entire array, the function returns -1, which is the expected output for cases where the target is not present in the array.

The function handles all edge cases effectively:
- If the array is empty, it returns -1 (correct behavior).
- If the target occurs multiple times, it finds the last occurrence correctly by scanning backward.

Given all of the above, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to check if the `target` exists in `arr`. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence. If the `target` is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. In sum, the function effectively performs a reverse linear search for the target in the sorted list, ensuring it returns the index if found or -1 if not.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
