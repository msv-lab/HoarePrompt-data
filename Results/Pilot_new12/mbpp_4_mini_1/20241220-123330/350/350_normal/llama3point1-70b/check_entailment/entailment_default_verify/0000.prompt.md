You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It does this by iterating through the array in reverse order and checks each element to see if it matches the target. If found, it returns the index of the element; if not found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

Hereâ€™s why it works for every potential case:
1. If the target does not exist in the array, it correctly returns -1.
2. If the target exists multiple times, it will return the index of the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration.
3. The function handles edge cases, such as when the array is empty or when the target is at the start or end of the array.

Overall, it satisfies the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to check if the `target` exists in `arr`. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence. If the `target` is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. In sum, the function effectively performs a reverse linear search for the target in the sorted list, ensuring it returns the index if found or -1 if not.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
