Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` successfully identifies the last position of a target integer in a sorted list. 

The annotations confirm the following:
1. The function iterates through the sorted list in reverse, ensuring that the last occurrence of the target is found and returned.
2. If the target is not found, the function correctly returns -1.
3. The program handles cases where the target does not exist or exists multiple times appropriately.

Although the annotations mention that the function does not handle an empty list, it is specified in the problem statement that the input will always be valid. Therefore, the function is expected to operate correctly under the assumptions provided.

Given this evaluation, the function meets the problem requirements, and the original assessment remains valid.
