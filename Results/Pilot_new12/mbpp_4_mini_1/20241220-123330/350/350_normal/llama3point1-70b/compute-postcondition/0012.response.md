The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function can return in the following cases:

Case 1: If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `target`, it returns `i`, where `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

Case 2: If the list `arr` is not empty, it returns `i`, which is the index of the second to last element in the sorted list of integers `arr`.

Case 3: If `arr` is not empty, it returns `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 3`.

Case 4: If the `target` is not found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the index of specific elements based on the conditions provided or -1 if the target is not found in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr (a sorted list of integers) and target (an integer), returning specific indices based on conditions or -1 if target is not found in arr.**
