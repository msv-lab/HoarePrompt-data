According to the code, the loop will iterate while the value of `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the second to last element of `arr`, which means `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will decrement by 1. 

Thus, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`. Since `arr` is not empty and remains unchanged during the loop, it will still be a sorted list of integers, and the condition for the element being checked needs to account for the new value of `i`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, and `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**
