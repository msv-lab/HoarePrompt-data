According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the index of the current element in the array `arr`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, meaning it points to the last element of the sorted list `arr`. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, we need to decrement `i` by 1 to point to the previous element for the next iteration.

After the last iteration, `i` will be decremented to `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, which will be true since `arr` is not empty and `len(arr) - 2` will be valid as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 1.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`**
