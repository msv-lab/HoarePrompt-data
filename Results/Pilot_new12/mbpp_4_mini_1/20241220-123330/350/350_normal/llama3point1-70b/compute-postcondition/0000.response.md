According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` starting from the last index of the list `arr` and goes down to 0. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `arr` must be greater than 0, which means `arr` must not be an empty list. At the start, `i` should be set to the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `arr` must not be empty, and `i` should be initialized as `len(arr) - 1`. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must not be empty, `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`**
