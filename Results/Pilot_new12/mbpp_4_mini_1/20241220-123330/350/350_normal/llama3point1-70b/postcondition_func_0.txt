The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to check if the `target` exists in `arr`. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence. If the `target` is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. In sum, the function effectively performs a reverse linear search for the target in the sorted list, ensuring it returns the index if found or -1 if not.
