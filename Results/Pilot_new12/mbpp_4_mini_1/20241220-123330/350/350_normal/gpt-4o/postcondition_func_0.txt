The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`. It searches for the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If found, it returns the index of that last occurrence. If `x` is not present in `arr`, it returns -1. The function handles the case where `arr` is empty by immediately returning -1 without executing the loop. Overall, the function reliably identifies the index of the last occurrence of `x` or indicates its absence.
