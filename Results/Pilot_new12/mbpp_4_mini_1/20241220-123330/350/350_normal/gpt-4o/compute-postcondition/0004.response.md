According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1.

Given that `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, to execute one more time, `i` will become `len(arr) - 2`. The loop must also ensure that `arr` has at least 1 integer, which has already been established. The last element of `arr` is still not equal to `x`, and this condition may remain unchanged unless `x` is part of previous iterations or is otherwise affected.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.**
