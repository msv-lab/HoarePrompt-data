The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `x` is an integer. 

Based on the output conditions, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:
- If the sorted list `arr` has at least one integer and one of the specified conditions matches, the function returns the appropriate index based on those conditions.
- Specifically:
  - Case 1: The function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, if certain conditions are met.
  - Case 2: The function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, under specific criteria.
  - Case 3: The function can return the index `i` equal to `len(arr) - 1` if the last element in `arr` is not equal to `x`.
  - Case 4: The function returns -1 if `x` is not found in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the overall functionality of the function `func_1` is to deal with finding the position of an integer `x` in a sorted list of integers `arr` and return specific index values or -1 based on the presence and position of `x` within the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, returning various indices based on the conditions checked, or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.**
