According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `len(arr) - 1`. Additionally, `arr` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, and the last element of `arr` is still not equal to `x`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**.
