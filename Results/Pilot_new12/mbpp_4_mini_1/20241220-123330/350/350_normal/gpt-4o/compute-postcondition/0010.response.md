Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`, and if `x` is present, `i` is the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is not present, the loop will execute `len(arr)` times, and if `len(arr)` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `i` undefined.**
