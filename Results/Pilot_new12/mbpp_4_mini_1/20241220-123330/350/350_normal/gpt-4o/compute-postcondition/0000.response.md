According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. The `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)` generates a sequence of indices starting from the last index of the list down to 0, implying that `arr` must not be empty. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the starting index of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one integer, and `i` must initially be set to `len(arr) - 1`. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
