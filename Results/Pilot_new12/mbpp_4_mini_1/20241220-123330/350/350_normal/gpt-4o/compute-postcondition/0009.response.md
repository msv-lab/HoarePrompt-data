Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one integer. If the last element of `arr` is equal to `x`, the function returns the index `i`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. However, since the last element of `arr` is stated to be not equal to `x`, there are no operations executed in the if part, and thus the program does not return any value.***
