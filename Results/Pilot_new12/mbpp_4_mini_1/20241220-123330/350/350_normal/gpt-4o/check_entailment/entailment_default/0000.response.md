The provided program `func_1` is designed to find the last position of a specified element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It does so by iterating through the array in reverse order, returning the index of the last occurrence of `x` if it's found, or -1 if `x` is not present in the array.

The output hints clarify that the function handles various scenarios, including returning -1 for an empty array. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function correctly identifies the last indexes in specific cases:

1. In the case of `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)`, it correctly returns `0` as `1` is at index `0`.
2. For `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, it returns `2`, correctly identifying the last occurrence of `1`.
3. For `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)`, it identifies the last occurrence of `3` at index `3`.

Since the output hints correspond with the logic of the code, we can see that the function correctly returns the last occurrence of the specified element across all provided examples. There are no indications of potential edge cases like any index being missed, as the loop correctly includes all indices regardless of the element counts. 

Therefore, the function does indeed perform as described in every potential case, fulfilling the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
