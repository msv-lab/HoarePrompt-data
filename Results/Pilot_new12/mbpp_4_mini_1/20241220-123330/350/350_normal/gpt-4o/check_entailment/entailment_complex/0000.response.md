Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`.

Here's an explanation of why the function meets the problem requirements:

1. **Sorted Input**: The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted, as stated in the annotations. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Last Occurrence**: The function iterates through the list from the last index to the first index (using `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`). This approach guarantees that if the value `x` is present in `arr`, the function will return the index of its last occurrence.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If `x` is found during the iteration, it immediately returns the index of `x`.
   - If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function returns `-1` to indicate that `x` is not present in `arr`. This is consistent with the requirement of the function as stated in the problem description.

4. **Empty List Handling**: If the input list `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `-1` is returned immediately. This behavior adheres to the problem requirements, as the absence of `x` in an empty list logically means it cannot be found.

Given these points, the function sufficiently meets the specifications of the problem description for all valid inputs, confirming its correctness.
