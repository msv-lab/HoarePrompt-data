Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. 

1. It iterates through the array in reverse order, which allows it to return the index of the last occurrence of the given element.
2. If the element is found, the index is returned immediately. If the element is not found at all, the function returns -1.

The provided assertions in the test cases validate its functionality:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns `0`, which is correct because 1 is at index 0.
- `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns `2`, which is correct because the last occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
- `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns `3`, which is correct because the last occurrence of 3 is at index 3.

Since all potential cases considered pass the requirements described, the function can be deemed correct.
