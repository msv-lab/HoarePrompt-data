Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The reasoning from the original assessment aligns with the annotations provided:

1. The annotations confirm that the input (`arr`) is indeed a sorted list of integers and that `x` is an integer.
2. The function iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, which is the correct approach to find the last occurrence of the element. 
3. The loop correctly returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` or `-1` if `x` isn't found, which matches expected behavior for valid inputs. 

The annotated state of the program also correctly captures the behavior and outcomes of the function. Thus, all aspects affirm the program's correctness according to the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the function works as intended.
