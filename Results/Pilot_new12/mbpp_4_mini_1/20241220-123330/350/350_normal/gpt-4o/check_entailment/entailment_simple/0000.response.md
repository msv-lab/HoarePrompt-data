The annotated program is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` appropriately identifies the last occurrence of the element and handles cases where the element may not be present.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the function behaves based on the provided problem description:

1. The loop iterates over the elements of the sorted array in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving towards the first index. This ensures that when it finds the element `x`, it will return the index of the last occurrence, as it traverses the array from end to start.

2. The conditional check `if arr[i] == x:` checks for the presence of `x`. If found, the index `i` of the last occurrence is returned.

3. If `x` is not found in the array after iterating through all elements, the function returns -1. This conforms with the requirement of the function to indicate the absence of the element.

Based on this behavior, there are no corner cases or inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description. It correctly identifies and returns the last index of `x` or -1 if `x` is not in the array, which satisfies the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
