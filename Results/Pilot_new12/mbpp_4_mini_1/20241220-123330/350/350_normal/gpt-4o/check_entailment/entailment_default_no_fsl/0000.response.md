Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, ensuring that it stops at the last occurrence of `x`. Given the outputs of the assertions in the code, we can verify that:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 3]` and `1`, it correctly returns `0`.
2. For the input `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `1`, it correctly returns `2`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `1`.
3. For the input `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and `3`, it correctly returns `3`, which is likewise the index of the last occurrence of `3`.

The function also correctly returns `-1` for an empty array or when `x` does not exist in `arr`, which is expected behavior. All potential input cases that can be reasonably anticipated based on the problem description are handled correctly, thus confirming that the function performs its intended task correctly across different scenarios.
