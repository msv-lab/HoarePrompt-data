To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the code and think about different test cases to see if it handles all possible scenarios.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. 

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0`  - This checks if the last occurrence of `1` is at index `0`, which is correct.
2. `assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2` - This checks if the last occurrence of `1` is at index `2`, which is correct.
3. `assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3` - This checks if the last occurrence of `3` is at index `3`, which is also correct.

### Additional Scenarios to Test:
1. Testing for an element not in the array:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `-1`.
2. Testing an empty array:
   - `func_1([], 1)` should return `-1`.
3. Testing for an element that appears at the last index:
   - `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 4)` should return `5`.
4. Testing for an element that appears only once:
   - `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 1)` should return `2`.

### Testing the Additional Scenarios:
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`, the code will go through the entire array and since `4` is not present, it will correctly return `-1`.
- For `func_1([], 1)`, since the array is empty, it will also correctly return `-1`.
- For `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 4)`, it will find `4` at index `5`, which is correct.
- For `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 1)`, it will find `1` at index `2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the last position of the specified element `x` in the array `arr` for all tested cases, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
