Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality defined in the problem description. It successfully finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr` by iterating in reverse order and returning the index of the last occurrence of `x`. The test cases provided validate that the function behaves as expected across a range of scenarios, including:

1. Returning the index 0 for the first element in `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. Correctly identifying the last occurrence of `1` in the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and returning index 2.
3. Finding the last occurrence of `3` in the array `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and returning index 3.

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function handles empty arrays appropriately by returning -1 without executing the loop. Thus, the program follows the guidelines specified in the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
