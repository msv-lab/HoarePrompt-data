Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The provided assertions in the test cases demonstrate that the function operates as expected:

1. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of `x` efficiently.
2. The annotations confirm the states before and after the critical loop, verifying that the function will return the correct index if found or -1 if not found.
3. There are no issues with the assumptions about input validity—such as the function handling positive integers or non-empty lists—which are stated to be guaranteed.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program's behavior, and the supporting annotations, the function operates correctly and meets the requirements as described. Thus, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
