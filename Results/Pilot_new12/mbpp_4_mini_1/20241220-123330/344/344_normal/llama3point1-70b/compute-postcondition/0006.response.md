Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns index 1. If `sorted_list[i]` is less than `value`, there is no other output or action taken.***
