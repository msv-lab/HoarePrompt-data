Initial State: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers, and `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted into the `sorted_list`.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`.

Output State after all iterations of the loop have finished: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers, and `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list` if all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value` or the first index `j` where `sorted_list[j]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If there was no early return, this means `i` must be within the bounds of the indices of `sorted_list`.

Output State: **`i` is the index where `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list`, `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and `value` is an integer intended for insertion.**
