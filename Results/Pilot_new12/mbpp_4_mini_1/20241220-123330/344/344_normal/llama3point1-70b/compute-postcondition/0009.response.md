Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function does not return anything. If `sorted_list[i]` is less than `value`, the function returns the index `i`, which is 2.***
