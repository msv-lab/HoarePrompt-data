According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` has at least one element, the loop will execute for indices starting from 0 up to the length of the list minus one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(sorted_list) - 1`. 

For the loop to be executed:
- The `sorted_list` must not be empty, meaning it should have at least one element.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
