According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `sorted_list`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of `sorted_list`, it can execute again if the index `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `sorted_list` has at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `sorted_list` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the value at index `i` in `sorted_list` is less than `value`.**
