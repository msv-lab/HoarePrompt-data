You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the program, we will analyze its functionality based on the problem description, which states the need to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Let's break down the behavior of the provided function:

1. The function iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`.
2. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
3. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element, which would be the insertion point.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the length of the `sorted_list`, which indicates that the `value` should be inserted at the end of the list.

Now, we will evaluate whether the function handles all possible edge cases correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. **Case with empty list:**
   - Input: `([] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since the list is empty, the correct insertion point is at index 0)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Case with a single element less than the value:**
   - Input: `([3] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `1` (insert after the single element)
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Case with a single element greater than the value:**
   - Input: `([7] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (insert before the single element)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Case where value must be inserted in the middle:**
   - Input: `([1, 3, 5] , 4)`
   - Expected Output: `2` (insert before the 5)
   - Actual Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Case where value is the new max:**
   - Input: `([1, 2, 3] , 4)`
   - Expected Output: `3` (insert at the end)
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

6. **Case with multiple duplicates:**
   - Input: `([1, 1, 1, 1], 1)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (should insert before the first 1)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

After analyzing these test cases, it is clear that the function handles edge cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, I can confirm:
Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function accepts a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`). It iterates through the list to find the appropriate index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. If an index is found where the current element is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns that index. If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns the length of the list, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. The final state of the program after execution is that `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and the function provides the index for insertion or the length of the list if no valid index exists. The function does not modify `sorted_list` or handle cases where the list is empty, which is an important edge case to consider.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
