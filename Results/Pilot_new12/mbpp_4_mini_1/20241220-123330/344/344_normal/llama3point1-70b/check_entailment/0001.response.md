To verify the correctness of the program, we will analyze its functionality based on the problem description, which states the need to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Let's break down the behavior of the provided function:

1. The function iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`.
2. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
3. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element, which would be the insertion point.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the length of the `sorted_list`, which indicates that the `value` should be inserted at the end of the list.

Now, we will evaluate whether the function handles all possible edge cases correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. **Case with empty list:**
   - Input: `([] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since the list is empty, the correct insertion point is at index 0)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Case with a single element less than the value:**
   - Input: `([3] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `1` (insert after the single element)
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Case with a single element greater than the value:**
   - Input: `([7] , 5)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (insert before the single element)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Case where value must be inserted in the middle:**
   - Input: `([1, 3, 5] , 4)`
   - Expected Output: `2` (insert before the 5)
   - Actual Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Case where value is the new max:**
   - Input: `([1, 2, 3] , 4)`
   - Expected Output: `3` (insert at the end)
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

6. **Case with multiple duplicates:**
   - Input: `([1, 1, 1, 1], 1)`
   - Expected Output: `0` (should insert before the first 1)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

After analyzing these test cases, it is clear that the function handles edge cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, I can confirm:
Correctness: **True**
