Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided annotated version of the code further clarifies the states and conditions of the program, confirming that the function appropriately handles the specified cases and maintains the integrity of the input list without modifying it.

The annotations support the original assessment by indicating that:
1. The inputs are valid per the problem description.
2. The function consistently returns the correct index for insertion based on the conditions checked while iterating through the sorted list.
3. Special cases like empty lists and lists with single or duplicate elements are handled correctly, as shown in the test cases.

Thus, the program's correctness is validated by both the original assessment and the provided annotations, leading to the conclusion that the function fulfills its intended purpose.
