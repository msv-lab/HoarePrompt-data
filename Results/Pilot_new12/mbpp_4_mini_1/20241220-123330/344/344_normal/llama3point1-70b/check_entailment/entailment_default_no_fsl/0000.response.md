Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the value is greater than all existing elements and should be appended at the end.

2. **Edge Cases**: The output hints correctly note that the function does not modify the `sorted_list` and handles the case where the list may be empty. When the list is empty, the function will correctly return `0`, which is the correct insertion index for any value.

3. **Validation of the Implementation**: The lack of handling for an empty list is not an issue according to the assumptions stated in the problem description that valid input will be provided. Thus, the function behaves as required in all potential scenarios outlined in the problem statement.

Overall, the function fulfills the requirement to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list and handles edge cases appropriately.
