Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here's why it meets the specified criteria:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is intended to find the appropriate insertion index for a given integer (`value`) in a sorted list (`sorted_list`). The algorithm iterates through `sorted_list` to find the first index `i` at which the element in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`.

2. **Iteration Over Sorted List**: The for loop iterates through all elements of `sorted_list`. If it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it correctly returns the index `i`. This approach ensures that if such an index exists, it is identified correctly.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: If no element in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the loop completes without returning an index, leading to the return of `len(sorted_list)`. This correctly indicates that the `value` should be appended to the end of the list, maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Unchanged State of `sorted_list`**: The code specifies that `sorted_list` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function, which is an important requirement stipulated in the problem description. The function only computes and returns the index for insertion without modifying the original list.

5. **Assumption on Input Validity**: It is specified that the function assumes valid input. While edge cases such as an empty list are not explicitly handled, the assignments state that such scenarios will not occur.

Given these points, the function adheres to the problem requirements and can determine the correct insertion index for any valid given inputs, thus ensuring it meets the problem description.
