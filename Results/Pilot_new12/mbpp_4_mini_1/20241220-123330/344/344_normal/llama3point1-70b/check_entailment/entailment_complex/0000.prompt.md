You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted into the sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the index where `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list`, `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and `value` is an integer intended for insertion.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the unchanged list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`). It iterates through the list to find the appropriate index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. If an index is found where the current element is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns that index. If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns the length of the list, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. The final state of the program after execution is that `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and the function provides the index for insertion or the length of the list if no valid index exists. The function does not modify `sorted_list` or handle cases where the list is empty, which is an important edge case to consider.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
