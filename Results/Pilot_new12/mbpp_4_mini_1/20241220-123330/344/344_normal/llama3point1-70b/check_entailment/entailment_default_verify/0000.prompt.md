You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the `sorted_list`, checking each element to see if it is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i`, which is the insertion point. If no such element is found, and the loop completes, it correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that the value should be appended at the end of the list. This logic handles all edge cases, including inserting a value smaller than the smallest element, equal to an element, or larger than the largest element in the list.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function accepts a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`). It iterates through the list to find the appropriate index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. If an index is found where the current element is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns that index. If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns the length of the list, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. The final state of the program after execution is that `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and the function provides the index for insertion or the length of the list if no valid index exists. The function does not modify `sorted_list` or handle cases where the list is empty, which is an important edge case to consider.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
