Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The given program iterates through a sorted list to find the first index where the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. While this works for most cases, it does not correctly handle the case where the `sorted_list` might be empty. If the list is empty and `value` is provided, the function will return `0`, which is not a valid insertion point since there's no element to compare against or insert before. According to the output hints, while it is stated that the function returns the length of the list if no valid index exists, if the list is empty, it does not specify how it should behave, leading to a potential misleading behavior for this edge case. Thus, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
