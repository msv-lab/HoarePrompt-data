Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the `sorted_list`, checking each element to see if it is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i`, which is the insertion point. If no such element is found, and the loop completes, it correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that the value should be appended at the end of the list. This logic handles all edge cases, including inserting a value smaller than the smallest element, equal to an element, or larger than the largest element in the list.
