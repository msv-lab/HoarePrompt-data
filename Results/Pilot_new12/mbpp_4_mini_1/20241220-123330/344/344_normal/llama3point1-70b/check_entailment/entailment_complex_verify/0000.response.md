Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The annotations confirm that the program iterates through the sorted list, consistently checking each element against the specified value and returning the appropriate index for insertion or the length of the list when the value exceeds all elements. The behavior is as expected, handling various edge cases regarding the insertion position without modifying the input list. Thus, the program is correct in its functionality as described.
