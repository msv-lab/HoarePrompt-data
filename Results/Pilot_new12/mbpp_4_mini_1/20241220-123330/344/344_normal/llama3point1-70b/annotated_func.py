#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted into the sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the index where `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list`, `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and `value` is an integer intended for insertion.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the unchanged list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`). It iterates through the list to find the appropriate index where `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. If an index is found where the current element is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns that index. If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns the length of the list, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. The final state of the program after execution is that `sorted_list` remains unchanged, and the function provides the index for insertion or the length of the list if no valid index exists. The function does not modify `sorted_list` or handle cases where the list is empty, which is an important edge case to consider.
