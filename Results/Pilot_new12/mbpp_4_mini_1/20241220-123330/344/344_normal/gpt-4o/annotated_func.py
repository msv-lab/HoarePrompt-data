#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order (non-decreasing), and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the number of elements in 'sorted_list' that are less than or equal to 'value', using the `bisect_right` function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and a parameter `value`, which is an integer. It uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to determine the position in `sorted_list` where `value` could be inserted to maintain sorted order. The function returns the count of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`, which is essentially the index where `value` would fit if inserted. Notably, the function does not handle cases where `sorted_list` is empty or where `value` is not an integer, but based on the provided context, it assumes valid inputs as per the specified preconditions.
