The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and a parameter `value`, which is an integer. It uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to determine the position in `sorted_list` where `value` could be inserted to maintain sorted order. The function returns the count of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`, which is essentially the index where `value` would fit if inserted. Notably, the function does not handle cases where `sorted_list` is empty or where `value` is not an integer, but based on the provided context, it assumes valid inputs as per the specified preconditions.
