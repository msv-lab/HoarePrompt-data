Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The problem requires a function that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order. The provided implementation uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which indeed finds the index where the specified value should be inserted in the sorted list to maintain sorted order.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` receives a sorted list of integers and a value as parameters. It returns the index at which the value can be inserted to keep the list sorted.

2. **Usage of bisect_right**: The usage of `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` is appropriate, as it returns the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. Consequently, the function effectively determines the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list`.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program check specific scenarios, ensuring the expected behavior when inserting values less than, equal to, and greater than existing list elements.

4. **Sorted Order Handling**: The program assumes the input list is sorted (which adheres to the problem constraints) and behaves correctly under this condition.

Given these points, the implementation meets all requirements specified in the problem description. It can effectively determine and return the correct insertion point for any valid input provided as specified by the problem statement. 

Therefore, the function fulfills its declared purpose correctly under the assumed valid input conditions.
