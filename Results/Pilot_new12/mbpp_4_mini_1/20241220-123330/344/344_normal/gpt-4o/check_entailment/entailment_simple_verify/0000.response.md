The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` fulfills the problem description by locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It accurately explains that the function uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the index where the value can be inserted while maintaining order, which means all test cases provided are valid and provide the correct results.

The annotations further support this assessment by confirming that at the point right before the function call, we have a sorted list and a value. Additionally, it details that the function correctly computes the number of elements in 'sorted_list' that are less than or equal to 'value' by using `bisect_right`, which aligns with the goal of determining the correct insertion index.

The reasoning behind the original assessment has not changed based on the annotations, and the provided evidence from both the assertions and annotations aligns well with the function's purpose and behavior as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, I maintain the conclusion of the original assessment as it accurately reflects the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
