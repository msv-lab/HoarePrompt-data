You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the given program against the problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1`, which is intended to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
import bisect

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4
```

The `func_1` function takes a sorted list and a value as input, and uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the insertion point for the specified value. The `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module returns the position in the list where the value can be inserted while maintaining the order. The important detail here is that `bisect_right` gives the index to insert the value to the right of existing entries, hence allowing duplicates.

**Testing the function:**
- For the first assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the correct return value is `4` because `6` should be inserted at the end of the list.
- For the second assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the correct return value is `2` because `3` fits between `2` and `4`.
- For the third assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the correct return value is also `4` since `7` should appear after the last element.

**Edge Cases:**
Letâ€™s consider additional edge cases to ensure the function behaves correctly:
1. **Inserting a value smaller than the smallest element:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 0) == 0
   ```
   This should return `0`, as `0` is less than all existing elements.
   
2. **Inserting a duplicate value:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 2) == 2
   ```
   This should return `2`, as it indicates the index to insert `2` to the right of existing `2`s.

3. **Inserting a value equal to the largest element:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 5) == 4
   ```
   This also should return `4`, indicating that `5` will be added to the right of any existing `5`s.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly handles these cases according to the problem description. Since there are no identified situations where the function fails to meet the requirements, we conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order (non-decreasing), and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the number of elements in 'sorted_list' that are less than or equal to 'value', using the `bisect_right` function


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
