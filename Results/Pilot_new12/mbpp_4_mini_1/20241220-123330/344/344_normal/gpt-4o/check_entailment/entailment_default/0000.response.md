Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` accurately implements the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which correctly determines the right insertion point for the specified `value` in the `sorted_list`. The output hints confirm that the function returns the appropriate index where `value` would fit in the sorted list, effectively counting elements that are less than or equal to the `value`. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints regarding handling empty inputs or type checks, we can assume that valid inputs are provided as per the context of the description. Thus, the function satisfies the problem requirements for all potential valid cases.
