Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` is correct as it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. According to the problem description, this involves determining the index at which the input `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `sorted_list`.

2. **Use of `bisect_right`**: The function uses `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` to achieve this. The `bisect_right` function specifically returns an index that is one greater than the last occurrence of `value` in `sorted_list`, which effectively provides the correct insertion point. If `value` is greater than all elements, it returns the length of the list, indicating that `value` should be placed at the end.

3. **Preconditions Assumed**: The function assumes that `sorted_list` is sorted and that the inputs are valid as per the specifications. These assumptions align with common expectations for such a function and do not violate the correctness concerning the problem description. It does not need to handle unusual cases because the context specifies that valid inputs will be provided. 

4. **Test Cases**: The provided `assert` statements test the function's correctness against various scenarios, confirming that it returns the expected indices for each input:

   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the expected insertion index is `4`, as `6` is greater than all elements.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the expected insertion index is `2`, where `3` would fit between `2` and `4`.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, again the index is `4`, which reflects `7` being greater than all sorted elements.

Since the function works as described in the problem statement and fulfills the requirements without explicitly requiring checks for edge cases that conform to the stated assumptions, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
