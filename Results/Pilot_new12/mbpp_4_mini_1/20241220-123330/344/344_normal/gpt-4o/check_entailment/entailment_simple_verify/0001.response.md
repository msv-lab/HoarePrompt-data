Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` leverages the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, and the annotated version explicitly describes the expected state of inputs prior to the function call, affirming that `sorted_list` is indeed a sorted list of integers and `value` is an integer.

The original assessment correctly noted that the function returns the appropriate indices for all provided test cases, demonstrating the right insertion points:
- For the value `6`, it correctly identifies the insertion point at index `4`,
- For the value `3`, it identifies the point at index `2`,
- For the value `7`, it also identifies the point at index `4`.

The annotations confirm that the function's logic and expected outcome are correctly understood, and edge cases are handled as the problem assumption is that inputs are valid. Thus, the original assessment of correctness stands validated.
