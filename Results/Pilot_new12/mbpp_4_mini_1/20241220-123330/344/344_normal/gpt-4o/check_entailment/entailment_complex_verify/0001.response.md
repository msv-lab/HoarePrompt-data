Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, as outlined in the problem description. The use of `bisect.bisect_right` is appropriate for this purpose, and the annotated comments further clarify what the function is doing.

The assertions provided confirm the correctness of the function with valid inputs. Each assertion checks a specific scenario for locating the insertion point, and all return values match the expected resultsâ€”demonstrating that the program behaves as intended under the specified conditions.

Additionally, the annotations indicate that the function is designed under the assumption that inputs will always meet the expected criteria (i.e., a list of integers in sorted order and an integer value). As per the assumptions stated, the lack of error handling for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness of the program because it is assumed that valid input will always be provided.

Overall, the combination of the original assessment, the behavior of the code, and the clarifying annotations consistently supports that the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
