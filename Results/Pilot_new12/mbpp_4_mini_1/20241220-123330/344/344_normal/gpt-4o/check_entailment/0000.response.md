To assess the given program against the problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1`, which is intended to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
import bisect

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4
```

The `func_1` function takes a sorted list and a value as input, and uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the insertion point for the specified value. The `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module returns the position in the list where the value can be inserted while maintaining the order. The important detail here is that `bisect_right` gives the index to insert the value to the right of existing entries, hence allowing duplicates.

**Testing the function:**
- For the first assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the correct return value is `4` because `6` should be inserted at the end of the list.
- For the second assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the correct return value is `2` because `3` fits between `2` and `4`.
- For the third assertion, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the correct return value is also `4` since `7` should appear after the last element.

**Edge Cases:**
Letâ€™s consider additional edge cases to ensure the function behaves correctly:
1. **Inserting a value smaller than the smallest element:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 0) == 0
   ```
   This should return `0`, as `0` is less than all existing elements.
   
2. **Inserting a duplicate value:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 2) == 2
   ```
   This should return `2`, as it indicates the index to insert `2` to the right of existing `2`s.

3. **Inserting a value equal to the largest element:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 5) == 4
   ```
   This also should return `4`, indicating that `5` will be added to the right of any existing `5`s.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly handles these cases according to the problem description. Since there are no identified situations where the function fails to meet the requirements, we conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
