Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that the `func_1` implementation uses the `bisect_right` function to determine the proper insertion point for a given integer value in a sorted list. The assertions provided also confirm the functionality of the code matches the expected behavior based on the problem description. 

The output hints reinforce this assessment by emphasizing that `func_1` is designed for valid inputs, specifically a sorted list and an integer value. Although the function does not handle edge cases with empty lists or non-integer values, it operates correctly under the assumption that inputs will meet these preconditions. Therefore, the program fulfills the functional requirements outlined in the problem description, supporting the conclusion of correctness.
