Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

The function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which accurately returns the index where the specified value would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided assertions:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct as `6` would be inserted at the end of the list.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct as `3` would be inserted between `2` and `4`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is correct as `7` would also be inserted at the end of the list.

All potential edge cases where the value is equal to any of the existing elements, less than the smallest element, or greater than the largest element are correctly handled. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all types of input.
