Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that finds the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list using the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module. 

The function fulfills the requirement to locate the index where the input `value` can be inserted into the `sorted_list` while maintaining sorted order. The provided examples in the assertions demonstrate that the function produces the expected results for valid input cases:

1. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the insertion point is 4 (the end of the list).
2. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the insertion point is 2 (to place 3 between 2 and 4).
3. For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the insertion point is again 4 (as 7 is greater than all elements).

Although the function does not include handling for edge cases like an empty list or non-integer values, the description specifies that it assumes valid inputs, and thus it adheres to the requirements as specified. Therefore, the implementation is considered correct for the given specification.
