Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter, `s`, which is a string. It processes the string to extract and return a new string that consists solely of the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. The function does not alter `s` and does not handle any cases beyond filtering for uppercase letters, meaning substrings, spaces, punctuation, and numbers are ignored.**
