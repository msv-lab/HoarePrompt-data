#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string that consists of the uppercase characters from the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter, `s`, which is a string. It processes the string to extract and return a new string that consists solely of the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. The function does not alter `s` and does not handle any cases beyond filtering for uppercase letters, meaning substrings, spaces, punctuation, and numbers are ignored.
