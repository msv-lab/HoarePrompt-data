You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description which requires a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The implementation only retains uppercase characters, but it does not ensure that all lowercase substrings are removed. For example:

1. For input `func_1('hello')`, the expected output is an empty string `''` since all characters are lowercase, while the actual output will be `''`, which is correct in this case.
2. For input `func_1('HelloWorld')`, the expected output would be `HW`, keeping only the uppercase letters, but this case also works since it outputs `HW`.
3. For input `func_1('aBcD')`, the expected output should be `BD`, but in the case provided in the assertion, it would result in `None` for an incomplete program.

However, the issue arises because, depending on the wording of "remove lowercase substrings", the description may suggest a different method of operation that retains the integrity of larger strings containing lowercase letters yet decides what constitutes a substring effectively.

Additionally, the function does not account for edge cases such as an empty string input `func_1('')` which should return an empty string. 

Thus, as the implementation focuses solely on filtering uppercase letters rather than comprehensively removing lowercase substrings, the program cannot be considered correct. There isn't a distinction between a substring and just sorting out letters; therefore, the case fails the requirement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter, `s`, which is a string. It processes the string to extract and return a new string that consists solely of the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. The function does not alter `s` and does not handle any cases beyond filtering for uppercase letters, meaning substrings, spaces, punctuation, and numbers are ignored.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
