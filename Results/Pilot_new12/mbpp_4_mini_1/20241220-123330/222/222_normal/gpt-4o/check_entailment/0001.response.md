Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description which requires a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The implementation only retains uppercase characters, but it does not ensure that all lowercase substrings are removed. For example:

1. For input `func_1('hello')`, the expected output is an empty string `''` since all characters are lowercase, while the actual output will be `''`, which is correct in this case.
2. For input `func_1('HelloWorld')`, the expected output would be `HW`, keeping only the uppercase letters, but this case also works since it outputs `HW`.
3. For input `func_1('aBcD')`, the expected output should be `BD`, but in the case provided in the assertion, it would result in `None` for an incomplete program.

However, the issue arises because, depending on the wording of "remove lowercase substrings", the description may suggest a different method of operation that retains the integrity of larger strings containing lowercase letters yet decides what constitutes a substring effectively.

Additionally, the function does not account for edge cases such as an empty string input `func_1('')` which should return an empty string. 

Thus, as the implementation focuses solely on filtering uppercase letters rather than comprehensively removing lowercase substrings, the program cannot be considered correct. There isn't a distinction between a substring and just sorting out letters; therefore, the case fails the requirement.
