The provided program aims to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, retaining only uppercase characters. 

The code implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```

This implementation iterates through each character in the string `s`, checks if it is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method, and constructs a new string consisting solely of those uppercase characters.

The output hints specify that the function processes the string to return only uppercase characters, and explicitly state that if no uppercase characters are found, the function will return an empty string. 

The code has been thoroughly tested according to the assertions provided:
1. `func_1('PYTHon')` results in `'PYTH'` (Uppercase letters retained).
2. `func_1('FInD')` results in `'FID'` (Uppercase letters retained).
3. `func_1('STRinG')` results in `'STRG'` (Uppercase letters retained).

The function handles all specified cases effectively, as there are no mentioned edge cases where the program would fail to remove lowercase substrings while retaining uppercase ones. It does not need to handle spaces or punctuation because it is specifically designed to focus only on uppercase letters. 

Since the program satisfies the problem description and passes all provided examples, we conclude that it is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
