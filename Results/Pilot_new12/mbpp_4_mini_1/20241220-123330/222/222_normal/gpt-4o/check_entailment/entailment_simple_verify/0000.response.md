Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly evaluates the program's functionality against the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from the input string by filtering out all characters that are not uppercase. The annotated version supports this conclusion by clearly stating that, prior to the function's execution, `s` contains lowercase substrings and that the function subsequently returns a string formed only of uppercase characters.

The provided test cases demonstrate that the function operates as intended, successfully returning strings that exclude lowercase letters. Each test case aligned with the asserted outputs confirms that the program meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
