Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem states that the function must remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implemented function `func_1` only retains uppercase characters, effectively filtering out any lowercase characters rather than removing lowercase substrings.

The logic in the program maintains only uppercase characters and discards lowercase characters entirely, but it does so by eliminating any characters that are not uppercase. This approach does not accurately reflect the intent of "removing lowercase substrings," as it does not account for the possibility that lowercase characters might be part of a larger substring.

For instance, consider the string 'abcDefg'. The expected output based on the problem description would require preserving 'De' to show the transition between uppercase and lowercase rather than just removing lowercase sections. But the program would output 'D', removing 'abc' and 'f' as well.

Therefore, the program fails to adhere to the problem description, which specifically mentions "lowercase substrings," leading to the conclusion that the correctness is indeed **False**.
