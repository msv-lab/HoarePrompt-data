Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It uses a list comprehension to filter only uppercase characters from the input string `s` and combines them into a new string, which is returned. All provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected by removing lowercase letters, and the function should work for any string input that consists of uppercase and lowercase characters. There are no edge cases or unexpected behaviors present in the provided logic.
