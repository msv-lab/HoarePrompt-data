Final: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description, which specifically requires a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the implementation filters out lowercase letters and retains only uppercase letters, which is not aligned with the task to remove lowercase substrings. The original assessment correctly identifies this failure: while the function behaves as described in the output hints—returning uppercase letters and an empty string when no uppercase letters are present—it does not fulfill the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings." Furthermore, the implementation does not correctly address the cases that require processing of mixed case strings or clarifying the meaning of "substrings." Therefore, the conclusion of "False" correctness remains accurate.
