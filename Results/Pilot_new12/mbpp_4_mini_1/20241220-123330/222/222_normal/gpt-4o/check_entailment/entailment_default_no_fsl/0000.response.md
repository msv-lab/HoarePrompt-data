Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the described function, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The implementation correctly filters out the lowercase letters by creating a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`. 

In every test case provided:
- For input `'PYTHon'`, it returns `'PYTH'`.
- For input `'FInD'`, it returns `'FID'`.
- For input `'STRinG'`, it returns `'STRG'`.

Furthermore, the output hints confirm that the function processes the string to extract uppercase characters exclusively, which aligns precisely with the task specified in the problem description. The function handles all edge cases regarding uppercase and lowercase character filtering correctly, and since there are no missing requirements based on the problem description, the program is considered correct.
