Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program returns a string that consists solely of the uppercase characters from the input string. For example, the input 'PYTHon' correctly results in 'PYTH', but this is not a removal of lowercase substrings; it simply preserves uppercase characters. 

A correct implementation would involve removing all contiguous lowercase substrings, potentially resulting in an empty string if the input is entirely lowercase or a string without any lowercase sequences. For instance, for the input 'abcDefg', the expected outcome would be 'D', since all lowercase characters should be removed. 

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the requirement of the problem description with regards to correctly handling and removing lowercase substrings.
