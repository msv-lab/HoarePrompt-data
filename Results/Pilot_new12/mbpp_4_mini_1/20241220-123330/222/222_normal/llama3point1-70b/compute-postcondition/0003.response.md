The code snippet `result += char` appends the current value of `char` (which is the first character of `s` and is an uppercase letter) to `result`. Initially, `result` is an empty string, so after the execution of this line of code, `result` will contain the uppercase letter from `char`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and the value of `char` remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is equal to `char`, where `char` is the first character in `s` and an uppercase letter.**
