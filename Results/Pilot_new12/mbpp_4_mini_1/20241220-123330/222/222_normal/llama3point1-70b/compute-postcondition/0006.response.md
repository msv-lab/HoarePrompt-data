`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. Since `result` was initially an empty string and `char` is the second character in `s` (which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters), `result` will now contain the value of `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `s`, `result` is equal to `char`.**
