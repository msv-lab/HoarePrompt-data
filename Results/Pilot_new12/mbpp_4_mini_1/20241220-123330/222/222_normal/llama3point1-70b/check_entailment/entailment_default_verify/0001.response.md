Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description explicitly states that the function is supposed to remove all lowercase substrings from a given string, implying that the resulting string should retain all non-lowercase characters, which includes uppercase letters and possibly other characters such as digits or symbols. 

However, the provided implementation only retains uppercase letters and ignores both lowercase letters and non-alphabetic characters. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements fully, as it fails to retain non-lowercase characters that are not uppercase, therefore it does not fulfill the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings" correctly. The output hints support this assessment by clarifying that uppercase letters are kept while all else is ignored, which further highlights the inaccuracy of the function relative to the problem description. Hence, the program is deemed incorrect.
