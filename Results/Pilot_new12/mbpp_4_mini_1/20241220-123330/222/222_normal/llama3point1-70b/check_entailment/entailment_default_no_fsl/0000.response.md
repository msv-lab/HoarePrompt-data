Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, it only extracts and returns uppercase characters from the input string while completely ignoring the lowercase characters. 

For instance, if the input is "Hello World", the function will return "HW", which does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description. The program fails to address the need to remove any lowercase characters from the input string, thus failing in the objective of the task. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function is intended to concatenate all uppercase characters, which further indicates that the necessary functionality of removing all lowercase substrings has not been implemented in the given code. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
