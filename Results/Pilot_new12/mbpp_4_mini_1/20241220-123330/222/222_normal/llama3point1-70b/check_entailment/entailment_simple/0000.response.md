Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that it should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program only extracts and returns uppercase characters from the string. It does not perform the required operation of removing lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the expected output according to the problem description would be "H W", as it should remove the lowercase letters and leave only the uppercase ones. However, the program would return "HW", which does not align with the task of removing lowercase substrings explicitly. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
