Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, which means it should return a string that only consists of non-lowercase characters. However, the implementation only retains uppercase letters and ignores other characters (including lowercase letters and non-alphabetic characters). 

For example, if the input string is "HeLlo123", the expected output should be "H" (or possibly "H123" depending on whether the number should be included), but the program only retains uppercase letters, resulting in "HL". 

The program is not handling the removal of lowercase substrings correctly, as it does not account for any non-lowercase characters other than uppercase letters itself.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings, and thus is incorrect.
