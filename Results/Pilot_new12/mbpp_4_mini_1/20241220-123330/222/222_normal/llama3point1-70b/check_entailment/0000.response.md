Correctness: **False**.

The program is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, it only appends uppercase characters to the result, effectively filtering out lowercase characters, which does not match the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings". 

For example, given the input string "abcDEFghi", the expected output should be "DEF" (removing all lowercase substrings completely). However, the output of the current program is also "DEF", which seems to fit, but it fails to recognize cases where lowercase substrings might be in larger sequences, such as the string "aAbBcCdD". The program only retains 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', but it does not successfully remove substrings; it merely accumulates uppercase characters and ignores the lower ones.

Additionally, if the input contains only lowercase characters (e.g., "abc"), the program will return an empty string, which aligns with the goal of removing lowercase parts; however, it does not perform this subprocess of "removing substrings" correctly.

To clearly state the flaw: the program does not explicitly handle substrings per the original requirement, rather it directly filters characters. Therefore, it is not correctly implementing the problem description as requested.
