Final: **False**

The original assessment stating that the program is incorrect is accurate. The program fails to implement the requirement of removing lowercase substrings and instead only retains uppercase characters. While it does produce the correct output for some cases, such as "abcDEFghi" returning "DEF", it does not fulfill the task of completely removing lowercase substrings as requested in the problem description. The function simply concatenates uppercase characters without addressing the need to eliminate entire sequences of lowercase substrings, which constitutes a fundamental flaw. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements, confirming the original assessment of correctness as **False**.
