Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function only captures and returns the uppercase characters from the input string `s`, completely ignoring the removal of lowercase substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the expected behavior (following the problem description) would be to return "H W", which removes the lowercase letters. However, the program will return "HW", effectively concatenating the uppercase letters without addressing the requirement of removing lowercase substrings. 

Thus, the core functionality needed to meet the problem description is absent from the implementation, making it incorrect.
