In the code snippet, `result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of `numbers`. The value of `total_sum` was the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`, and the length of `numbers` represents how many numbers are in the list. Therefore, we can express the new value of `result` as `result = total_sum * len(numbers)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of the numbers in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`, and `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`**.
