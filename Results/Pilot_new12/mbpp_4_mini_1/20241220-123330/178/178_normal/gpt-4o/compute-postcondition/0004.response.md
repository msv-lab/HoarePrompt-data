The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of the rounded values of the numbers in the list `numbers` and then calculates the product of this total sum with the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of the numbers and the length of the list.
