#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of the rounded values of the numbers in the list 'numbers', and the length of the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function 'func_1' accepts a parameter 'numbers', which is a list of integers or floats. It processes this list by rounding each number, calculating the sum of these rounded values, and then multiplying that sum by the length of the original list 'numbers'. The result, which is the product of the total sum of the rounded numbers and the length of the original list, is returned. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the total_sum will be 0 and the length will also be 0, resulting in a product of 0. There is no explicit handling for non-numeric types within the input list, which could lead to potential runtime errors if such values are encountered.
