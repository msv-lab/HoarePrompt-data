Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down how it meets each aspect of the problem:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `numbers`, which is a list of numbers (either integers or floats). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Rounding Each Number**: Inside the function, a list comprehension is used: `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`. This rounds every number in the list, which is exactly what the problem requires.

3. **Summation**: The program computes the total sum of the rounded numbers using `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`. This summation is also required by the problem description.

4. **Final Computation**: The program then multiplies the computed sum by the length of the original list with `result = total_sum * len(numbers)`. This step matches the requirement to multiply the total sum by the length of the list.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns this computed result, which is in accordance with the expected output based on the problem.

The assertions provided in the program also validate that the function behaves correctly for different inputs, showing that the sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list yields the expected results.

Since the program satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem description and has been tested against provided cases, it is deemed correct.
