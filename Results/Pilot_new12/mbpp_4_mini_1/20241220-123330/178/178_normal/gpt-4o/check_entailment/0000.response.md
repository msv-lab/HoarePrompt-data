Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle an edge case when the input list is empty. In that case, `len(numbers)` would equal 0, resulting in a division by zero error when multiplying `total_sum` by `len(numbers)` (which is 0). The program would fail to return a proper result for an empty list. 

Here's a breakdown of the example that fails:
- Input: `func_1([])` should be defined, but the current implementation would raise an error because of multiplying by zero. 

Thus, the program is incorrect since it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
