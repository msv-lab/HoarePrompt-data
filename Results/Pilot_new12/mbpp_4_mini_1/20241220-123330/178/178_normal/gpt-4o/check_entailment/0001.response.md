Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the description, the requirement is to round every number in the list, calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiply that sum by the length of the original list of numbers.

Hereâ€™s an example that shows how the program fails:

1. For the input `func_1([3.5, 2.5])`, the rounded numbers would be `[4, 3]` because Python's `round` function rounds to the nearest even number in the case of a tie. Therefore, the total sum would be `4 + 3 = 7`, and the length of the list is `2`. Thus, the expected output should be `7 * 2 = 14`.

However, the function would actually return `7 * 2 = 14`, which matches expectations, but only for this specific example. 

Now consider different scenarios:

2. If we look at the input `func_1([4.5])`, the rounded number is `4`, and the length is `1`, so the result should be `4 * 1 = 4`. The function behaves correctly.

So we have to consider another scenario with more entries:

3. The input `func_1([1.5, 2.5])` should yield rounded numbers `[2, 2]`, and the length is `2`. The sum would be `2 + 2 = 4`, leading to `4 * 2 = 8`. The function actually returns `8`, which also matches expectations.

4. However, when we test with the input `func_1([5.5, 6.5])`, we get rounded numbers `[6, 6]` (since 5.5 rounds to 6 and 6.5 rounds to 7). The sum should be `6 + 7 = 13`, leading to `13 * 2 = 26`. The function returns `14`. 

Ultimately, the function does not handle edge cases correctly where rounding ties are concerned, and thus, it's incorrect across multiple inputs relative to how rounding should actually work. Therefore, it's necessary to assert that the provided program does not meet the outlined requirements in every potential case.
