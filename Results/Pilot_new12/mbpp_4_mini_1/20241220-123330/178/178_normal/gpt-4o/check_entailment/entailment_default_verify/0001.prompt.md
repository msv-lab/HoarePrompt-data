You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the description, the requirement is to round every number in the list, calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiply that sum by the length of the original list of numbers.

Hereâ€™s an example that shows how the program fails:

1. For the input `func_1([3.5, 2.5])`, the rounded numbers would be `[4, 3]` because Python's `round` function rounds to the nearest even number in the case of a tie. Therefore, the total sum would be `4 + 3 = 7`, and the length of the list is `2`. Thus, the expected output should be `7 * 2 = 14`.

However, the function would actually return `7 * 2 = 14`, which matches expectations, but only for this specific example. 

Now consider different scenarios:

2. If we look at the input `func_1([4.5])`, the rounded number is `4`, and the length is `1`, so the result should be `4 * 1 = 4`. The function behaves correctly.

So we have to consider another scenario with more entries:

3. The input `func_1([1.5, 2.5])` should yield rounded numbers `[2, 2]`, and the length is `2`. The sum would be `2 + 2 = 4`, leading to `4 * 2 = 8`. The function actually returns `8`, which also matches expectations.

4. However, when we test with the input `func_1([5.5, 6.5])`, we get rounded numbers `[6, 6]` (since 5.5 rounds to 6 and 6.5 rounds to 7). The sum should be `6 + 7 = 13`, leading to `13 * 2 = 26`. The function returns `14`. 

Ultimately, the function does not handle edge cases correctly where rounding ties are concerned, and thus, it's incorrect across multiple inputs relative to how rounding should actually work. Therefore, it's necessary to assert that the provided program does not meet the outlined requirements in every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function 'func_1' accepts a parameter 'numbers', which is a list of integers or floats. It processes this list by rounding each number, calculating the sum of these rounded values, and then multiplying that sum by the length of the original list 'numbers'. The result, which is the product of the total sum of the rounded numbers and the length of the original list, is returned. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the total_sum will be 0 and the length will also be 0, resulting in a product of 0. There is no explicit handling for non-numeric types within the input list, which could lead to potential runtime errors if such values are encountered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
