Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the steps outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` which takes a list of numbers (either integers or floats). Hereâ€™s how it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Rounding every number:** The function uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list (`rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`).

2. **Calculating the total sum of the rounded numbers:** It computes the sum of the rounded values using the `sum()` function (`total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`).

3. **Multiplying by the length of the list:** The function then multiplies this total sum by the length of the original list (`result = total_sum * len(numbers)`).

4. **Returning the final result:** Finally, the result is returned from the function.

The function correctly handles the given assertions in the test cases, producing the expected output for each set of input provided.

Additionally, the function is designed to return 0 when the input list is empty, which is a reasonable output within the context of the problem. There is no explicit error handling for non-numeric types, but it is stated that the input will be valid, which aligns with the assumption that the program will only receive appropriate inputs.

Thus, the function meets all aspects of the problem description and behaves as expected for the cases provided.
