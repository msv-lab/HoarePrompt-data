Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements for every potential case outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it lacks handling for non-numeric types within the input list. If the input list contains any non-numeric types (e.g., strings or None values), the program will raise a runtime error during the rounding and summation processes. This behavior could lead to failure for any such input, which means it does not correctly address all potential scenarios as required by the problem description. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 'three'])`, it would raise a TypeError when it tries to round the string 'three'. Thus, even though the program works correctly for numeric inputs, it is not correct for all cases.
