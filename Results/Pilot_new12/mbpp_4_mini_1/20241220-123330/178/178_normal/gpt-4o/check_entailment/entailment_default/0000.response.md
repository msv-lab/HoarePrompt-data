The provided program `func_1` rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the list. 

The output hints indicate that the function processes numeric types but does not handle non-numeric types, which could lead to runtime errors. However, the problem description does not specify that the input must exclusively contain numeric types or that the input will be validated. It implies that the function is expected to handle lists of numbers correctly.

Additionally, the program is designed to return 0 if an empty list is passed, as both the sum will be 0 and the length will also be 0, resulting in a product of 0.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (a list of numbers), there is no explicit requirement that the function needs to handle non-numeric values. 

The examples given in the assertions work correctly according to the problem description, as they all produce the expected results when valid numeric inputs are provided.

Considering that the function behaves correctly under the stated assumptions and the output hints accurately describe its behavior without contradicting the requirements set forth in the problem description, we conclude that the given function is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
