The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numerical values. After executing the function body, it calculates the product of `total_sum`, which is the sum of the rounded values of elements in `numbers`, and `len(numbers)`, which is the number of elements in the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numerical values `numbers` and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of its elements and the count of those elements.
