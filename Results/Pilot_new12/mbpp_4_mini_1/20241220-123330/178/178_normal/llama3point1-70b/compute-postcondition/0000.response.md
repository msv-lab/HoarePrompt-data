The variable `rounded_numbers` is being assigned a new list created by applying the `round` function to each element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, the value of `rounded_numbers` will now contain the rounded results of the numerical values in `numbers`. The variable `numbers` itself is not affected, so we keep its previous state. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list containing the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`.**
