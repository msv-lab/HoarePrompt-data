`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`. The value of `rounded_numbers` depends on the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, but since no operations affecting `numbers` or `rounded_numbers` were performed, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects `numbers` as a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` as the corresponding rounded values, and `total_sum` is the sum of those rounded values.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list containing the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`.**
