#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of rounded values of elements in 'numbers', and len(numbers), which is the number of elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values called `numbers`. It rounds each number in the list, calculates the total sum of these rounded values, and then returns the product of this total sum and the count of elements in the original list. If `numbers` is empty, the function will return `0` since the count will be `0`, even if there are no numbers to round or sum. The function does not handle non-numeric values in the list; if present, the function will raise an error.
