Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes a list of numerical values as input and performs the following steps:

1. It rounds each number in the input list `numbers` using a list comprehension. This is done correctly as it applies the `round()` function to each element.
2. It calculates the total sum of these rounded values using the `sum()` function, which complies with the problem description's requirement to sum the rounded numbers.
3. Finally, it returns the product of the total sum of the rounded values and the length of the original list (using `len(numbers)`). This meets the requirement to multiply the sum by the length of the input list.

The function handles the case where the input list may be empty by correctly returning `0` because `sum([])` evaluates to `0`, and `len([])` is also `0`, thus resulting in a product of `0`.

The comments in the code affirm that the functionality aligns with the requirements, stating that it rounds values, calculates their sum, and returns the product with the count of elements. Since the problem description assumes valid input and does not require handling non-numeric values, the implementation is considered correct within the given constraints.

Therefore, the function consistently adheres to the problem description for all valid input scenarios, justifying the response of True.
