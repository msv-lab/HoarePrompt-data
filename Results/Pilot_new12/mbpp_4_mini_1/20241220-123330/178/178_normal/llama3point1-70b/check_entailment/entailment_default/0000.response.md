Explanation: The code looks correct initially based on the output hints and the problem description. The function takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, computes the sum of these rounded values, and returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The output hints accurately describe this behavior and confirm that if the `numbers` list is empty, the function will correctly return `0`. However, an important aspect mentioned in the output hints is that the function does not handle non-numeric values in the list; if such values are present, the function will raise an error, which the code does not account for. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
