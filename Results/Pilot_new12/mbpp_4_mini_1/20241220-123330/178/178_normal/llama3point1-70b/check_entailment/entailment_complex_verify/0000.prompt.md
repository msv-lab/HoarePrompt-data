You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program rounds each number in the input list, sums the rounded values, and multiplies that sum by the length of the list. 

1. The rounding function `round(num)` accurately rounds numbers to the nearest integer.
2. The `sum(rounded_numbers)` correctly calculates the total of the rounded numbers.
3. Finally, multiplying by `len(numbers)` gives the correct result as per the problem description.

I can't find any potential case where this program behaves incorrectly based on the given problem description. Thus, the implementation meets all the requirements, and the correctness is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of rounded values of elements in 'numbers', and len(numbers), which is the number of elements in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values called `numbers`. It rounds each number in the list, calculates the total sum of these rounded values, and then returns the product of this total sum and the count of elements in the original list. If `numbers` is empty, the function will return `0` since the count will be `0`, even if there are no numbers to round or sum. The function does not handle non-numeric values in the list; if present, the function will raise an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
