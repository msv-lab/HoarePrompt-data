You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number using the `round()` function, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that total sum by the length of the original list. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Rounding**: It rounds each number in the input list using a list comprehension, which is a valid approach.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
3. **Multiplication by Length**: Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list using `len()`, which aligns with the requirements.

The program will work for any list of numbers, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list (which will return 0, as the length of the list is 0).
- A list with all zeroes, which will also work correctly and return 0.
- A list of negative numbers, which will be rounded and summed appropriately.

Thus, the implementation meets all specified requirements of the problem description for any input case considered.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numerical values called `numbers`. It rounds each number in the list, calculates the total sum of these rounded values, and then returns the product of this total sum and the count of elements in the original list. If `numbers` is empty, the function will return `0` since the count will be `0`, even if there are no numbers to round or sum. The function does not handle non-numeric values in the list; if present, the function will raise an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
