Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but upon reviewing the output hints, it's clear that the program does not handle non-numeric values in the list, which can lead to errors when such values are encountered. The output hints explicitly mention that if non-numeric values are present, the function will raise an error. This indicates a limitation in the program's robustness that contradicts the completeness expected in the problem description. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements fully, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed not correct as it may fail under certain valid input conditions (specifically the presence of non-numeric values).
