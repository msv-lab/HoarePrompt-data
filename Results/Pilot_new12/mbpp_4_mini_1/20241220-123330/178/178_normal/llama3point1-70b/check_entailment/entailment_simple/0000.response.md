Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of numerical values.
2. It uses a list comprehension to round each number in the `numbers` list. The use of `round(num)` ensures that each number is rounded correctly to the nearest integer.
3. The function then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
4. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the original `numbers` list with `len(numbers)`.
5. Finally, the function returns the result of this multiplication, thereby fulfilling the requirements stated in the problem description.

Given that the function performs the expected sequence of operations and handles valid input as assumed in the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct. It appropriately rounds each number, sums them, and multiplies the sum by the length of the list, aligning perfectly with the task as stated.
