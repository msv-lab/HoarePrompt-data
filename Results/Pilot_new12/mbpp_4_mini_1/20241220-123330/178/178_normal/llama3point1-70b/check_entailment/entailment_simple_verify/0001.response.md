Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, calculates their total sum, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the original list. 

The annotations reinforce this correctness, indicating that before the function call, `numbers` is indeed a list of numerical values, and the program successfully computes the desired result by summing the rounded numbers and multiplying by the length of the list. 

The program handles various cases (like an empty list or lists with negative numbers) appropriately under the assumption of valid input, aligning with the problem description. Thus, the implementation meets all specified requirements.
