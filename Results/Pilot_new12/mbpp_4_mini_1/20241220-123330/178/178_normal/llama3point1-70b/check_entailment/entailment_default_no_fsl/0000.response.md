Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case. While it correctly rounds the numbers and handles an empty list by returning `0`, it does not account for non-numeric values in the list. If the function is passed a list that contains non-numeric values, it will raise an error during execution, which is not in line with the expectations of the problem description. Therefore, since there can be an input case that leads to an error, the overall correctness of the code is deemed incorrect.
