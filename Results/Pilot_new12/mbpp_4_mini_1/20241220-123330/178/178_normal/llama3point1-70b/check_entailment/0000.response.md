Correctness: **True**.

The program rounds each number in the input list, sums the rounded values, and multiplies that sum by the length of the list. 

1. The rounding function `round(num)` accurately rounds numbers to the nearest integer.
2. The `sum(rounded_numbers)` correctly calculates the total of the rounded numbers.
3. Finally, multiplying by `len(numbers)` gives the correct result as per the problem description.

I can't find any potential case where this program behaves incorrectly based on the given problem description. Thus, the implementation meets all the requirements, and the correctness is confirmed.
