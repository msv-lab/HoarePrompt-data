Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number using the `round()` function, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that total sum by the length of the original list. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Rounding**: It rounds each number in the input list using a list comprehension, which is a valid approach.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
3. **Multiplication by Length**: Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list using `len()`, which aligns with the requirements.

The program will work for any list of numbers, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list (which will return 0, as the length of the list is 0).
- A list with all zeroes, which will also work correctly and return 0.
- A list of negative numbers, which will be rounded and summed appropriately.

Thus, the implementation meets all specified requirements of the problem description for any input case considered.
