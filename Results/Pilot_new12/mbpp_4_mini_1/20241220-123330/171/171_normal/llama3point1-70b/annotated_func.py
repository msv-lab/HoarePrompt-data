#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer and False if n is an even integer, determined by the condition n % 2 != 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and determines its parity. It returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors if such inputs are provided. Additionally, it does not consider special cases like `n` being None or any other data types. The overall behavior is focused solely on returning a boolean value that reflects the odd or even status of the provided integer.
