The provided Python function checks whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

The implementation of the function:
```
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
```
looks logically sound and, according to the output hints, it accurately returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if it is even. The program appears to conform to the problem description as it successfully determines the parity of integers.

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors if such inputs are provided, as well as scenarios like `n` being `None` or other data types. This behavior highlights that the function only accounts for integer inputs and could malfunction or raise exceptions with invalid input types, such as floating-point numbers, strings, etc. 

Given that the problem description does not specify what to do in the event of non-integer inputs, and that the hints clearly mention this limitation, we conclude that the function does not handle every potential case properly.

Correctness: **False**.
