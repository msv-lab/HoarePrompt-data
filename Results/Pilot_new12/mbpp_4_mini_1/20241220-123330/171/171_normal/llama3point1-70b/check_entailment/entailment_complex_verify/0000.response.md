The program `func_1` correctly determines if a provided integer `n` is odd by returning `True` if it is odd and `False` if it is even. The original assessment accurately identifies that the function properly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check for odd parity.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding. It states that the function accepts an integer parameter `n`, correctly checks whether it is odd, and points out that it does not handle non-integer inputs. However, the assumption provided in the problem description is that valid inputs are given to the function. Therefore, the annotations mention limitations concerning input types but do not impact the correctness of the function as it adheres to the expectations set forth in the problem description.

Given all this information, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct for the intended task aligns well with the provided annotations and the problem description.

Final: **True**
