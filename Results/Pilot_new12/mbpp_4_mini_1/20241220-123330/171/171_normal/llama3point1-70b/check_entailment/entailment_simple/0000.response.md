Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set out in the problem description, which is to determine whether the parity of a given integer is odd. 

Here is the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` takes one argument, `n`, which is expected to be an integer.
2. The condition `n % 2 != 0` checks if the number `n` is odd. 
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` evaluates to 1, making the expression `n % 2 != 0` true, thus the function will return `True`.
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` evaluates to 0, making the expression false, thus the function will return `False`.
3. Therefore, the function behaves exactly as specified in the problem description: it correctly identifies the parity of the integer `n` as odd or not.

Since the program correctly determines the odd parity for any valid integer input, it meets the requirements laid out in the problem statement.
