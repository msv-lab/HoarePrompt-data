Final: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirement of the problem description by determining the parity of an integer. It accurately returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers through the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 

The original assessment stating the correctness of the program is still valid, as it focuses on the intended functionality of detecting odd and even integers. Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer inputs and other special cases, it is stated that we are assuming valid integer input will be provided. Therefore, under the given problem constraints, the function performs as expected without any issues.

Thus, considering the function's intended behavior and the assumptions about input validity, the program adheres fully to the requirements of the problem description and the initial assessment remains accurate.
