Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of the given number `n` is odd. The logic used, `n % 2 != 0`, successfully checks if the number is odd by returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. 

The parity (odd or even) of any integer `n` can be correctly identified using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n` is odd, the remainder when divided by 2 will be 1 (`n % 2` equals 1), making the expression `n % 2 != 0` evaluate to `True`. Conversely, if `n` is even, the remainder will be 0, which will make the expression evaluate to `False`.

Thus, I cannot find any potential cases where the function does not work as expected; it performs correctly for all integer inputs. Therefore, the program adheres fully to the requirements of the problem description.
