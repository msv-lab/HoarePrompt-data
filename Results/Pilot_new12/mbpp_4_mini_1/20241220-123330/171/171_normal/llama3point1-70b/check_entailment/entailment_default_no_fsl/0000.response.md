Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(n)` aims to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by checking `n % 2 != 0`. While this works correctly for integer inputs, the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the function does not consider special cases where `n` could be `None` or other data types. 

For example, if the input is a string like `"3"` or a float like `3.5`, the function will raise a `TypeError`. Since the problem description requires handling of all potential inputs, including invalid ones, the function fails to meet this requirement, resulting in incorrect behavior. Thus, it is incorrect if it cannot handle the outlined edge cases.
