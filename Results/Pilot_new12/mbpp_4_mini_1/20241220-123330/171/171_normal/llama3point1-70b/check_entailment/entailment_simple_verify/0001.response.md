Final: **True**

The program `func_1(n)` meets the problem description by correctly identifying whether the parity of the input integer `n` is odd. The original assessment accurately states that the logic `n % 2 != 0` successfully checks the parity by returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. 

The annotations confirm that just before the function call, `n` is indeed an integer, and the return statement clearly explains the behavior of the program in terms of parity checking. Since the program is designed to handle valid integer inputs as per the problem description, and given that the annotated code aligns with the original assessment, the conclusion about the program's correctness is solid. 

Thus, the initial assessment remains justified, and the program is correctly implemented according to the specifications.
