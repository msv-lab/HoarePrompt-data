Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly implements parity checking for a given number. It uses the modulus operator `n % 2` to determine whether the number `n` is odd. The expression evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2) and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., divisible by 2). 

Since the function accurately checks for odd parity across all integer inputs (positive, negative, and zero), there are no potential edge cases where it fails to meet the specification in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for the intended task.
