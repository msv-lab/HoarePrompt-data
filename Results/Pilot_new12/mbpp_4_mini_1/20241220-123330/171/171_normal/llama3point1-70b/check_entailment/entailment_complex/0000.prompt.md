You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer and False if n is an even integer, determined by the condition n % 2 != 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and determines its parity. It returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors if such inputs are provided. Additionally, it does not consider special cases like `n` being None or any other data types. The overall behavior is focused solely on returning a boolean value that reflects the odd or even status of the provided integer.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
