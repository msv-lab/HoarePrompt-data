Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and checks whether its parity is odd by evaluating the condition `n % 2 != 0`. This condition effectively determines if `n` is odd (returns `True`) or even (returns `False`).

The annotations further clarify that the function accurately returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Moreover, it explicitly states that the function does not handle non-integer inputs, but this does not affect its correctness given the assumption that valid integer inputs are provided.

Overall, since the function meets the requirement of determining the parity of the input integer correctly for all valid integer cases (odd or even), it aligns perfectly with the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
