Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and determines its parity. It returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors if such inputs are provided. Additionally, it does not consider special cases like `n` being None or any other data types. The overall behavior is focused solely on returning a boolean value that reflects the odd or even status of the provided integer.**
