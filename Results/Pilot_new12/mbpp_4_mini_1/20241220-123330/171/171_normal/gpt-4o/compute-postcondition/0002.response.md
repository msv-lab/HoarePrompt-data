Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. The function correctly identifies even and odd integers, but it does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer (e.g., floats or non-numeric types), which could lead to unexpected behavior when such values are passed. The final state of the program is that it provides a boolean output indicating the parity of `n`.**
