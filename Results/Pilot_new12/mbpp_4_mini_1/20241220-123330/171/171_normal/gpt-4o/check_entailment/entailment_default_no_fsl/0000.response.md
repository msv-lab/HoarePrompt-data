Correctness: **False**

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that determines the parity of an integer `n`, returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The assertions confirm that the function correctly identifies the parity for integer inputs as demonstrated by the cases provided (e.g., `func_1(12)` returns `False`, `func_1(7)` returns `True`, `func_1(10)` returns `False`). 

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer, such as floats or non-numeric types. For instance, invoking `func_1(3.5)` or `func_1("text")` would lead to unexpected behavior, as the function is designed to work only with integers. Therefore, since the program does not handle all potential cases outlined in the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
