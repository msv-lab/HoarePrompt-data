Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the input `n` is an odd integer by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression returns `True` when `n` is odd (i.e., has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2) and `False` when `n` is even (i.e., has a remainder of 0).

2. The assertions before the function call validate that the function produces the correct boolean output for specific test cases:
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False` (even).
   - `func_1(7)` returns `True` (odd).
   - `func_1(10)` returns `False` (even).

3. In the overall annotated explanation, it is confirmed that the function will provide a boolean output indicating the parity of `n`, which satisfies the requirement defined in the problem description.

4. Although the program does not explicitly handle non-integer input types, the assumption is made that valid integer inputs will be provided, which means it will function correctly under the expected scenarios outlined in the problem description.

Thus, given the program meets the requirements for the valid inputs specified in the problem description, it is correct.
