Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of determining whether the parity of a given number is odd by returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. The annotations provided affirm that the program is designed to accept an integer and accurately reflects the desired behavior of the function. While the annotations note that the function may not handle non-integer inputs, the task specifies valid integer inputs, which aligns with the assumptions made in the assessment. Thus, since there is no evidence in the annotations or the problem description indicating that the function fails under the given constraints, the original assessment remains valid.
