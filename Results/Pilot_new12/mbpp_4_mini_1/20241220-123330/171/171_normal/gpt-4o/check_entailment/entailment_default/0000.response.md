The program correctly checks if a given integer's parity is odd by using the modulo operator. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if the number is even. The assertion tests confirm this behavior for specific cases.

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the cases where `n` is not an integer (e.g., floats or non-numeric types), which could result in unexpected behavior. This means that while the function works correctly for the expected input type (integers), it does not guarantee correct behavior if the input type does not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically regarding input validation for non-integer types, we must conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
