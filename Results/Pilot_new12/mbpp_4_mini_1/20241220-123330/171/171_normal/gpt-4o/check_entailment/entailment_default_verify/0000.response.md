Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct and confirms its correctness based on the provided assertions. While the function does correctly determine the parity of integer inputs (returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers), the output hints highlight a significant limitation: the function does not account for cases where `n` is not an integer. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect outputs when non-integer values (like floats or strings) are passed to the function. 

Given that the problem description does not specify that the input will always be an integer, the lack of handling for non-integer inputs indicates that the program is not comprehensive in fulfilling the requirements and could fail with invalid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be adjusted to reflect this oversight.
