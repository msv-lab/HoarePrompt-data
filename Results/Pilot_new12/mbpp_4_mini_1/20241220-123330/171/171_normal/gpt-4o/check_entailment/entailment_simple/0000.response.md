Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. It evaluates if the input integer `n` is odd by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression will return `True` for odd numbers (when the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero) and `False` for even numbers (when the remainder is zero).

The provided assertions in the program further validate its correctness:
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` confirms that the function correctly identifies 12 as an even number.
- The assertion `assert func_1(7) == True` confirms that the function correctly identifies 7 as an odd number.
- The assertion `assert func_1(10) == False` confirms that the function correctly identifies 10 as an even number.

Since all these assertions are designed according to the problem description, the function behaves as expected and fulfills the requirement of determining if the parity of a number is odd. Therefore, it meets the problem description fully for all input cases assumed to be valid integers.
