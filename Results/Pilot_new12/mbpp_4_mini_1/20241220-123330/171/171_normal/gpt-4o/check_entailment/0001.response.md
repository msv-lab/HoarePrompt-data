Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. If `n` is odd, this condition will return `True`; if `n` is even, it will return `False`. 

In the provided assertions:
- `func_1(12)` correctly returns `False` (since 12 is even).
- `func_1(7)` correctly returns `True` (since 7 is odd).
- `func_1(10)` correctly returns `False` (since 10 is even).

Since all test cases align with the problem description and there are no identified cases where the function fails, we conclude that the program is correct for all potential inputs regarding determining the oddness of a number.
