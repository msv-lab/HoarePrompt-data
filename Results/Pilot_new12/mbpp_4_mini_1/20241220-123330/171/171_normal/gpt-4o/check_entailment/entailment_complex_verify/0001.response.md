Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of the given integer `n` is odd. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion by confirming that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. 

The assertions provided in the program (for inputs 12, 7, and 10) align with the expected output based on the parity of those integers. Additionally, the assumption that the input will always be a valid integer aligns with the reasoning that the program does not explicitly handle non-integer types; hence, it is considered correct under the specified conditions.

Since all aspects of the program meet the problem description and the annotations confirm its intended behavior, we conclude that the program is correct.
