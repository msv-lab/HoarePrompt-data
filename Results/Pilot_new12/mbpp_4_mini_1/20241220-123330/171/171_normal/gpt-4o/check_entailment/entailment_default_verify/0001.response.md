Final: **False**

While the function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies whether an integer is odd or even and provides the expected results for the test cases outlined in the original assessment, it does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer, such as floats or non-numeric types. The output hints explicitly state this limitation. Although we assume valid input based on the problem description, the original assessment fails to account for this caveat, which impacts the overall correctness of the program since it does not guarantee reliable behavior across all possible usages. Thus, the absence of input validation for non-integer types means the program does not fully meet the requirements of robustness expected in a production setting.
