Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly determines the parity of a given number. It returns `True` for odd numbers (when the number is not divisible by 2) and `False` for even numbers (when the number is divisible by 2). The assertions provided are accurate test cases that confirm the function behaves as expected for both scenarios (even and odd). Since there are no other cases or inputs mentioned that would lead to incorrect outputs, the function satisfies the problem description comprehensively.
