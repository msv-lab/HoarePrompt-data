Final: **True**

The annotated code and the original assessment are consistent with the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly evaluates whether the parity of the input number `n` is odd by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. The annotations reflect the correct functionality of the code, clearly stating that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers.

The provided assertions (`func_1(12)`, `func_1(7)`, and `func_1(10)`) were confirmed to produce the expected results in line with the problem description. Since the sampled values are all covered and demonstrate proper behavior, and the assumptions of valid input are upheld, the program is accurate.

Thus, the original assessment of correctness stands validated, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct for determining the oddness of the given number.
