#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, and False if n is an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. The function correctly identifies even and odd integers, but it does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer (e.g., floats or non-numeric types), which could lead to unexpected behavior when such values are passed. The final state of the program is that it provides a boolean output indicating the parity of `n`.
