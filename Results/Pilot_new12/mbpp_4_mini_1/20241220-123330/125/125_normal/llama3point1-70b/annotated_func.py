#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from 'lst' at intervals of 'n', starting from each index 'i' in the range of 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` that are selected at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. This process effectively divides the original list `lst` into `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element, thus creating a series of staggered views into the original list. There are no explicit edge cases handling for scenarios such as an empty list or `n` being greater than the length of `lst`, but the function is defined such that `n` will always satisfy the condition `n <= len(lst)`.
