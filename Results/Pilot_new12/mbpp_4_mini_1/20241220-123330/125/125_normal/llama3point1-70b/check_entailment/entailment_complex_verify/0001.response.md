The original assessment accurately identifies that the program adheres to the problem description. According to the provided annotations and the analysis, the function correctly breaks the input list into sublists according to the stipulated requirements: selecting every n-th element based on its index, and producing appropriate results for various cases of n.

### Key Points from the Annotation
- The function takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, ensuring `n <= len(lst)`. 
- It returns a list of lists, where each sublist derives from `lst` starting from indexes that increase by `n`.
- The function does not explicitly handle edge cases (empty list or `n` greater than `len(lst)`), but it's noted that the function is designed for valid inputs, which will always ensure that `n` is less than or equal to `len(lst)`. 

### Conclusion
Thus, the original assessment that the program is correct holds true, as all analyzed cases align with the expectations set forth in the problem description. The notation confirms that the function will operate correctly under the input constraints described.

Final: **True**
