Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to split a list into sublists based on a specified step size `n`. The description specifies that it should return a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements from the original list (`lst`) at intervals of `n`.

2. **Implementation**: The function uses a list comprehension to generate sublists. It iterates through each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and uses slicing (`lst[i::n]`) to create each sublist. The slicing method effectively captures every nth element starting from the index `i`.

3. **Correct Input Handling**: The function assumes valid inputs as described—that `n` is a positive integer and `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The problem description explicitly states these conditions, and since we assume the input will always be valid, the implementation does not require checks for edge cases like empty lists or invalid values.

4. **Output Verification**: The output of the function is a list of lists, which aligns with the demand to "return a list of the resulting lists" for every nth element, confirming that it effectively divides `lst` into the required structure.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the specified behavior in the problem description.
