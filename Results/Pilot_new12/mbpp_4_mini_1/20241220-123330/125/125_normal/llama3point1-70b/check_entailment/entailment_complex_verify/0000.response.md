The annotations provided clarify that the program is expected to operate with the conditions that `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not greater than the length of `lst`. This assumption significantly alters the evaluation of the correctness of the program relative to the original assessment.

1. **Compliance with Problem Description**: The function splits the list into sublists of every `n`-th element starting from different indices up to `n-1`. This matches the problem description where it states that the function should return a list of resulting lists. 
   
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The annotations explicitly state that we assume valid input. Therefore, the cases of empty lists, zero, or negative n (which the original assessment highlighted as problematic) are, under the current assumptions, not applicable to this evaluation. 

3. **Result of Valid Cases**:
   - For an input list like [1, 2, 3] and n = 2, the output would be `[[1, 3], [2]]`, which is correct as per the expectations.
   - For an input list of size less than `n`, as stated in the annotations, the slicing logic will inherently manage these by returning empty sublists where applicable, which is precisely what's expected.
  
Given these clarifications with the annotations and the assumptions about input validity, the original assessment unnecessarily flagged concerns under circumstances that are no longer relevant given the constraints.

Final: **True**
