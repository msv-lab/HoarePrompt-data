You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements stated in the problem description, we need to analyze the code and consider various inputs.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list for every `n`th element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis
The implementation uses list comprehension to iterate over a range of `n`, then creates slices of `lst` starting from the index `i` and taking every `n`-th element. 

Let's break down how this operates with different cases:

1. **For `n = 1`**: 
   - The entire list should be returned as a single list.
   - Result should be: `[[elem1, elem2, ..., elemN]]`

2. **For `n = 2`**:
   - The function will return two slices: the first at indices 0, 2, 4, ... and the second at indices 1, 3, 5, ...
   - Result should be: `[[elem1, elem3, elem5, ...], [elem2, elem4, elem6, ...]]`

3. **For `n > len(lst)`**:
   - If `n` is larger than the length of the list, the function will return an empty list for indices greater than the length of `lst` that it tries to slice, leading to a list of empty sub-lists. 
   - This behavior matches the expectation since every "slice" beyond the available elements would naturally result in an empty list: `num_slices = n`, but `len(lst)` is less than `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty list or `n <= 0` would also be valid edge cases. The behavior in these situations must also be verified. Given `n <= 0`, the range creates an empty iterable, resulting in an empty list, which again matches expectations.

### Conclusion
After examining the code with various inputs, I see that the program does adhere to the problem description. Outputs for different values of `n` properly create the expected sub-lists from the original list according to the provided specifications.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` that are selected at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. This process effectively divides the original list `lst` into `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element, thus creating a series of staggered views into the original list. There are no explicit edge cases handling for scenarios such as an empty list or `n` being greater than the length of `lst`, but the function is defined such that `n` will always satisfy the condition `n <= len(lst)`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
