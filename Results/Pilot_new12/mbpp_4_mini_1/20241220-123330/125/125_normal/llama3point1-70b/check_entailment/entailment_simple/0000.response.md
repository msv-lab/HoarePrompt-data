Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements as described in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should split a list for every nth element and return a list of the resulting lists. This implies that we want to create sublists where each sublist consists of every nth element starting from the first element, then the second, and so on, not sublists starting from every index from 0 to n-1.

In the annotated program, the comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` creates a sublist starting from index `i` and includes every `n`th element from that starting point until the end of the list. For example, with a list of 10 elements and `n = 3`, the program would produce:

- Starting from index 0: [0, 3, 6, 9]
- Starting from index 1: [1, 4, 7]
- Starting from index 2: [2, 5, 8]

Instead, if we were to split the original list for every nth element, the expected output would be something different, where we would simply create slices like `[lst[0:n], lst[n:2n], lst[2n:3n], ...]` until the end of the list.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of splitting the list correctly based on every nth element, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
