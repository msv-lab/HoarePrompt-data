Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` and splits the list into sublists, each containing elements selected at intervals of `n`. 

The program's logic correctly uses list comprehension to generate sublists starting from each index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1` and collects every `n`th element from this starting point. The output hints confirm that the function creates staggered views into the original list, adhering to the described behavior.

Since the problem highlights that the input conditions will always be satisfied (that is, `n` will always be less than or equal to the length of `lst`), the function does not need additional error handling for those specific conditions. The functionality is consistent with the problem's requirements for every valid input scenario, which leads to the conclusion of the program's correctness. Thus, no counterexamples can be found that would lead to a failure in meeting these requirements.
