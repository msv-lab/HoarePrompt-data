Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` indeed meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` and splits the list at every nth element, returning a list of resulting sublists. The output hints correctly summarize the function's behavior: it returns sublists that contain elements selected at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

The program assumes that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, and since the problem description states this condition and assumes valid inputs, we do not need to account for scenarios such as an empty list or `n` being greater than `len(lst)`. Each generated sublist correctly represents the staggered view into the original list as specified.

Overall, the function implementation and the output hints align perfectly with the problem description, confirming that the code is correct for all anticipated scenarios.
