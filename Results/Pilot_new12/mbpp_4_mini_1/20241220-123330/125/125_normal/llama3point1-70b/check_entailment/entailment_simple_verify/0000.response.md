Based on the provided problem description, program, and analysis, I will assess the correctness of the program `func_1`.

**Original Assessment Overview:**
The original assessment indicates potential issues related to cases where `n` is zero, as well as handling situations where the length of the list is less than `n`. These considerations were deemed important for the correctness of the function, leading to the conclusion that the function is incorrect.

**Annotated Version Observation:**
The annotated version clearly states that `n` is a positive integer and that `n` is less than or equal to the length of the list at the point just before the function call. This greatly limits the scope of potential issues presented in the original assessment. Given this context, the positive integer assumption ensures that problematic cases like zero or negative values for `n` are not a concern.

**Evaluation of Potential Issues:**
1. **Empty List Case**: While the program should technically handle the empty list case, the annotations state that the inputs are valid, so there is no issue here.
2. **Case Where Length of List Is Less Than n**: The annotation indicates that `n` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `len(lst)`, so this situation does not apply.
3. **Correct Behavior of Slicing**: The program correctly returns the intended sublists based on the slicing mechanism described, as confirmed by the annotations.

**Conclusion:**
The constraints provided in the annotations lead to the conclusion that the function operates correctly under the assumptions stated. The behavior of the function aligns with the problem description and successfully executes the intended operation without encountering the issues raised in the original assessment.

Final: **True**
