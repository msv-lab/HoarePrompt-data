You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program attempts to create a list of lists by slicing `lst` starting at each index from `0` to `n-1` and taking every `n`-th element.
2. The approach (`lst[i::n]`) seems intended to return segments of the original list starting from different indices.

**Potential Cases to Consider:**
- **Empty List Case:** If `lst` is empty, then regardless of `n`, the function should return an empty list. The current implementation does this correctly.
- **Negative or Zero Case:** If `n` is `0`, the slicing operation `lst[i::n]` becomes problematic since `n` cannot be zero in a slicing context. This is an edge case that needs to be handled, as it can lead to a runtime error.
- **Single Element List:** If `lst` has one element and `n` is `1`, the expected result is `[[element]]` but the current implementation will return `[[element]]`.
- **Cases Where Length of List Is Less Than n:** When the length of the list is less than `n`, the output should ideally be a list that handles this case correctly, but the current implementation may cause slices that are not intended based on the description.

**Example of Failure Case:**
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 5`, the expected outputs are `[]` for indices `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` since the source list does not have enough elements. The program will still return elements mistakenly based on index and will have unexpected slicing behavior.

Given the concerns around edge cases, particularly with negative or zero `n` and incomplete data handling for slicing:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` that are selected at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. This process effectively divides the original list `lst` into `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element, thus creating a series of staggered views into the original list. There are no explicit edge cases handling for scenarios such as an empty list or `n` being greater than the length of `lst`, but the function is defined such that `n` will always satisfy the condition `n <= len(lst)`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
