Based on the problem description, the program is tasked with taking a list and an integer `n`, and returning a list of sublists formed by taking every `n`-th element. The program's logic using list comprehension correctly generates the sublists by slicing the input list.

The original assessment provides detailed reasoning supporting that the function behaves correctly for different scenarios, including edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list or when `n` is 1. The program correctly handles these cases according to the requirements laid out in the problem description. The annotated code confirms that the slices are created as intended, and that each sublist contains elements from the original list at intervals defined by `n`.

Thus, the original assessment concludes that the program meets the problem description's requirements, which is supported by the analysis of the function and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
