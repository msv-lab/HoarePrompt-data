To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program attempts to create a list of lists by slicing `lst` starting at each index from `0` to `n-1` and taking every `n`-th element.
2. The approach (`lst[i::n]`) seems intended to return segments of the original list starting from different indices.

**Potential Cases to Consider:**
- **Empty List Case:** If `lst` is empty, then regardless of `n`, the function should return an empty list. The current implementation does this correctly.
- **Negative or Zero Case:** If `n` is `0`, the slicing operation `lst[i::n]` becomes problematic since `n` cannot be zero in a slicing context. This is an edge case that needs to be handled, as it can lead to a runtime error.
- **Single Element List:** If `lst` has one element and `n` is `1`, the expected result is `[[element]]` but the current implementation will return `[[element]]`.
- **Cases Where Length of List Is Less Than n:** When the length of the list is less than `n`, the output should ideally be a list that handles this case correctly, but the current implementation may cause slices that are not intended based on the description.

**Example of Failure Case:**
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 5`, the expected outputs are `[]` for indices `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` since the source list does not have enough elements. The program will still return elements mistakenly based on index and will have unexpected slicing behavior.

Given the concerns around edge cases, particularly with negative or zero `n` and incomplete data handling for slicing:

Correctness: **False**.
