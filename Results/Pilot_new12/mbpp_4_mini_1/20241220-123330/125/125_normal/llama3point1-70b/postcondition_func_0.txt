The function takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` that are selected at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`. This process effectively divides the original list `lst` into `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element, thus creating a series of staggered views into the original list. There are no explicit edge cases handling for scenarios such as an empty list or `n` being greater than the length of `lst`, but the function is defined such that `n` will always satisfy the condition `n <= len(lst)`.
