The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of lists where each sublist is constructed from the elements of `lst` at intervals of `n`, beginning from each index `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at intervals of `n`, starting from each index `i` in the range of 0 to n-1.**
