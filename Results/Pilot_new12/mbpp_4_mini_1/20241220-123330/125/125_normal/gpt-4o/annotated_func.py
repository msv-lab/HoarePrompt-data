#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing `n` lists, each containing elements from `lst` distributed such that each list `result[j]` contains every `n`th element from `lst` starting at index `j`, for all `j` in the range of `n`, `lst` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    return result
    #The program returns the list `result`, which contains `n` lists, where each list is made up of every `n`th element from the input list `lst`, starting at consecutive indices from 0 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` corresponds to every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from indices 0 through `n-1`. If `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty. The function distributes elements from `lst` into these sublists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that all elements are included in the output. This means elements are placed into the sublists based on their index in `lst`, cycling through the `n` sublists. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
