Let's analyze the given problem description and the corresponding program.

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

### Analysis:

The function `func_1` is designed to distribute elements of `lst` into `n` separate lists based on their indices. Using `i % n` ensures that each element is distributed cyclically among the `n` lists. 

Now, let's confirm if the implementation meets the requirements and if it handles edge cases correctly:

1. **Basic Cases (Assured by assertions):**
   - For `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n=3`, it correctly returns a list of lists where items are placed in every third position.
   - Similar assertions are made for a list of integers and a list of programming languages, providing expected outcomes.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **n equals 0:** If `n` is `0`, this will cause a division/modulo error (`ZeroDivisionError`) because the program attempts to create `result` as a list of size `n`.
   - **Empty list:** If `lst` is empty and `n > 0`, it correctly returns `[]`, which is expected. However, `n` being `0` will still cause an issue as stated.
   - **Negative values for n:** If `n` is negative, it does not handle this situation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to create `result`.

### Conclusion:

The function has scenarios that are not handled correctly based on the problem description, including cases where `n` equals `0` or is negative. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
