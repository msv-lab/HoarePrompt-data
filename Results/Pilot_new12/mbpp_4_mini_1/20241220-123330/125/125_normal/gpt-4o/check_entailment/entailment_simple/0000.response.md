Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality outlined in the problem description. It takes a list and an integer `n`, then splits the list into `n` sublists, each containing elements from the original list taken at intervals of `n`.

Here's how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a result list `result` that contains `n` empty lists. This is done using a list comprehension, which ensures that there are `n` sublists ready to collect the elements of the original list.

2. **Distribution of Elements**: The `for` loop iterates over the elements of the input list `lst`. It employs the `enumerate` function to get both the index (`i`) and the element (`element`). For each element, it calculates the appropriate sublist index by using `i % n`. This effectively distributes the elements across the `n` sublists, where each sublist at `result[j]` consists of every `n`th element from the input list starting at index `j`.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the list `result`, which contains the expected structure of sublists.

The provided assertions test the function against various inputs, and all assert statements confirm that the function produces the correct output for those specific cases.

Therefore, it always adheres to the problem requirements by correctly splitting the input list into sublists based on the specified frequency of `n`. 

Thus, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description without any apparent deficiencies.
