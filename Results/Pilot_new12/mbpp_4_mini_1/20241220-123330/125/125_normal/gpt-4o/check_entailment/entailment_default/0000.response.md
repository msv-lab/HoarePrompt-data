The provided program should take in a list and an integer `n` and split the list into sublists every `n`th element. 

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. The function creates `n` empty sublists within the list `result`.
2. It then iterates over the input list `lst`, using the index `i` to determine which sublist to append the element. The element is added to `result[i % n]`, effectively distributing the elements among the `n` sublists in a round-robin fashion.

The output hints specify that the function does indeed create `n` sublists and distributes the elements correctly according to indices 0 through `n-1`. However, the hints also point out two potential issues:

- If the input list, `lst`, contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty. This situation is acceptable as per the requirement.
- It doesn't handle the case when `lst` is empty or when `n` is not a positive integer. Although it is assumed that valid inputs are provided, the program should ideally check for these specific edge cases.

However, since the assumption states that input will always be valid, the function will not raise unexpected behavior based on invalid input as long as valid input is provided. The examples given in the problem description, as well as the output hints, indicate that the function works according to the requirements. 

Thus, since it successfully distributes the elements and meets the problem description without any evident unhandled cases based on the assumptions made, we can conclude the program is functioning correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
