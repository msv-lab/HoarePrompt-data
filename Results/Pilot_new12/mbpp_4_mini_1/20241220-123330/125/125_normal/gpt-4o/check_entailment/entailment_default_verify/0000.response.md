Given the analysis of the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, we can conclude the following:

**Program Functionality**: 
The function `func_1` is intended to split a list into `n` sublists, where each sublist collects every nth element starting from indices 0 through `n-1`. The provided assertions confirm that the function seems to work correctly for several cases when `n` is a positive integer.

**Edge Cases**:
1. The function does not handle `n = 0`, which would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError` upon attempting to create an empty result list with `n` as the size.
2. There is no handling for negative values of `n`.
3. While not mentioned in the prompt, if assumptions about input validity are strictly followed, the cases of an empty list are ignored since the function would simply return an empty list but still does not fail.

**Output Hints Confirmation**: 
The output hints confirm that the function is expected to accept a list and a positive integer. The lack of handling for certain edge cases does not invalidate the correctness provided we assume valid inputs as stated. However, the original concern regarding unhandled edge cases was valid.

**Final Assessment**:
The original assessment accurately identified that the program's lack of handling certain edge cases (like `n` being `0` or negative) could lead to unexpected behavior and shouldn't be considered fully correct under all circumstances. 

Thus, maintaining the conclusion of the original assessment as correct is warranted.

Final: **False**
