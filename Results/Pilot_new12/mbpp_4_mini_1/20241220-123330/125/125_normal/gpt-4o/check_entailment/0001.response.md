To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function:

The function takes in a list `lst` and an integer `n` and is supposed to split the list into sublists based on every `nth` element.

### Assessing the Program:

1. **Initialization**: The result is initialized with `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`, which creates `n` empty sublists.
2. **Iteration Logic**: It then iterates over the input list using an index and element. For each element, it appends the element to one of the sublists based on `i % n`.

### Evaluation of Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']`, `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`, `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL']`, `n = 2`
  - Expected Output: `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**:
   - If we call `func_1([], 3)`, the output should be `[[], [], []]`, which is correct.
   
2. **Single Element**:
   - If we call `func_1(['x'], 1)`, the output should be `[['x']]`, which is correct.

3. **n Greater than List Length**:
   - If we call `func_1([1,2,3], 5)`, the expected behavior should be handling gracefully. The function would actually give `[1, 2, 3]` in the first sublist and empty others. This case shows no explicit handling for `n` being larger than the length of `lst`. This is worth considering as a potential edge behavior.

### Conclusion:
While the given assertions in the code execute correctly, there are potential edge cases that the function does not explicitly handle, particularly when `n` is greater than the length of the input list. Therefore, since the problem requires handling every possible case correctly, the lack of handling for cases such as `n` greater than `lst` indicates that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
