Final: **True**

The original assessment identified that the function `func_1` behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly initializes a list of sublists and distributes the elements from the input list into these sublists based on the provided integer `n`.

Reviewing the annotations, they confirm the correctness of the implementation by clarifying that if `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty, which is an expected behavior as per the requirements. Additionally, the assertion tests demonstrate that the function performs correctly for various inputs.

The concern noted in the original assessment regarding the handling of cases when `n` exceeds the length of the list does not affect the determination of correctness since the problem description does not stipulate strict handling beyond the provided functionality and the expected basic behavior has been observed.

Thus, the function conforms to the problem description, executing as intended, while the annotations substantiate the correctness of this implementation.
