You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function:

The function takes in a list `lst` and an integer `n` and is supposed to split the list into sublists based on every `nth` element.

### Assessing the Program:

1. **Initialization**: The result is initialized with `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`, which creates `n` empty sublists.
2. **Iteration Logic**: It then iterates over the input list using an index and element. For each element, it appends the element to one of the sublists based on `i % n`.

### Evaluation of Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']`, `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`, `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL']`, `n = 2`
  - Expected Output: `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`
  - The function correctly distributes the elements.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**:
   - If we call `func_1([], 3)`, the output should be `[[], [], []]`, which is correct.
   
2. **Single Element**:
   - If we call `func_1(['x'], 1)`, the output should be `[['x']]`, which is correct.

3. **n Greater than List Length**:
   - If we call `func_1([1,2,3], 5)`, the expected behavior should be handling gracefully. The function would actually give `[1, 2, 3]` in the first sublist and empty others. This case shows no explicit handling for `n` being larger than the length of `lst`. This is worth considering as a potential edge behavior.

### Conclusion:
While the given assertions in the code execute correctly, there are potential edge cases that the function does not explicitly handle, particularly when `n` is greater than the length of the input list. Therefore, since the problem requires handling every possible case correctly, the lack of handling for cases such as `n` greater than `lst` indicates that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` corresponds to every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from indices 0 through `n-1`. If `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty. The function distributes elements from `lst` into these sublists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that all elements are included in the output. This means elements are placed into the sublists based on their index in `lst`, cycling through the `n` sublists. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
