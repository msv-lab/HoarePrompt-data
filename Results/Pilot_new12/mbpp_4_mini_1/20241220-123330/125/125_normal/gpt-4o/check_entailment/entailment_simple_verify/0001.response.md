The original assessment evaluates the functionality of the `func_1` function against the problem description. The assessment highlights that the function indeed splits the list based on every `nth` element and verifies this functionality through multiple test cases. All assertions provided in the test cases return the expected results, affirming that the function performs as intended for those examples.

However, the original assessment raises concerns about handling cases where `n` may be greater than the length of `lst`. It was noted that in such instances, the behavior is not explicitly defined, which could imply potential shortcomings.

In reviewing the annotated version of the code, we see that:
1. The function initializes a results structure that includes `n` empty lists.
2. The function iterates through the list `lst` and distributes the elements into the appropriate sublists based on the index `i` modulo `n`.
3. The annotation confirms that the result is precisely what the problem description requires, irrespective of the edge case where `n` exceeds the list length, since it has been stated that all inputs are assumed to be valid.

The assumption that the inputs are always valid and that no users will input an invalid list or an inappropriate `n` (like a negative number or zero) alleviates concerns regarding the edge case where `n` might exceed the list length.

Given the evidence from the annotations and original assessment, it is clear that the behavior of the `func_1` function meets the specifications laid out in the problem description effectively, and issues raised in edge cases do not undermine the overall correctness under the given assumptions.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment and conclude:

Final: **True**
