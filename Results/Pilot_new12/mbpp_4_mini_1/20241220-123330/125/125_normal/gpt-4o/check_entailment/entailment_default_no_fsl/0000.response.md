Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the list `lst` is empty. According to the output hints, if `lst` is empty, the function should return `n` empty sublists, but the implementation may not handle that correctly, given there is no check for an empty list.

Example case that highlights the incorrect behavior:
- If we input an empty list and `n` as 3: `func_1([], 3)`. The expected output should be `[[], [], []]`, but the function may not produce this behavior without explicitly addressing the empty input case. 

Thus, since there are cases where the code does not work as expected (i.e., when `lst` is empty), the overall correctness of the program is false.
