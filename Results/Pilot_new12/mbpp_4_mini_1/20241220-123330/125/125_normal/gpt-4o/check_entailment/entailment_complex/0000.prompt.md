You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing `n` lists, each containing elements from `lst` distributed such that each list `result[j]` contains every `n`th element from `lst` starting at index `j`, for all `j` in the range of `n`, `lst` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
    return result
    #The program returns the list `result`, which contains `n` lists, where each list is made up of every `n`th element from the input list `lst`, starting at consecutive indices from 0 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` corresponds to every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from indices 0 through `n-1`. If `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty. The function distributes elements from `lst` into these sublists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that all elements are included in the output. This means elements are placed into the sublists based on their index in `lst`, cycling through the `n` sublists. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
