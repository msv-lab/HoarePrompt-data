Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in highlighting that the function `func_1` does not handle all edge cases, especially with respect to the value of `n`. While it is asserted that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs with `n` as a positive integer greater than 0, it neglects scenarios where `n` could be zero or negative. The function as defined would raise errors in those cases, thus not meeting the complete requirements of the problem description which assume valid input scenarios. As per the commentary in the annotations and original assessment, the program's correctness is thus limited by its failure to account for various input conditions effectively. Therefore, the program cannot be deemed correct universally, leading to the conclusion of **False**.
