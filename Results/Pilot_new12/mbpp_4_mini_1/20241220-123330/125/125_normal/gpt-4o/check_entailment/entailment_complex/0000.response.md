Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. 

Here is the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a positive integer (`n`), and splits the list into `n` sublists, wherein each sublist contains every nth element. The distribution is done in a round-robin fashion, which means that it allocates elements based on their index modulo `n` (i.e., `i % n`).

2. **Output Structure**: The output is a list of `n` lists. Each inner list corresponds to elements from the original list starting from a different index, cycling through the input list `lst`. This matches the requirement of returning a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of every nth element.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided assert statements include multiple test cases that validate the function against different types of input (both strings and integers). In each case, the expected output aligns with the defined behavior of the function, confirming that the function performs as specified.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: Although the function does not handle edge cases (like returning empty lists when `lst` is shorter than `n`), the problem description explicitly states that we assume input will be valid. 

Overall, since the core functionality of splitting the list according to the specified requirements is executed properly and the function's behavior aligns with the problem description for a variety of test cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
