The original assessment accurately identifies the core functionality of the `func_1` program and the issue it has with handling edge cases, particularly the scenario where `n` is greater than the length of the input list `lst`. 

The output hints provide clarity on what the function is supposed to do and confirm that it distributes elements into `n` sublists based on their index in a round-robin fashion. The hints also make it clear that if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, some sublists may be empty, which the function does not explicitly handle. However, the absence of explicit handling for such cases is not necessarily a correctness issue given the assumption that input will be valid.

Therefore, based on the program's functionality, support from the output hints, and the original assessment's reasoning about potential edge cases, I maintain that the original assessment correctly describes the program's correctness.

Final: **False**
