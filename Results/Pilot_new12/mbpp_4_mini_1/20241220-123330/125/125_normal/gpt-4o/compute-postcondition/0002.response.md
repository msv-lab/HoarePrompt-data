The code appends the value of `element` to the `result` list at the index determined by `i % n`. Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the calculation of `i % n` will yield 0. Thus, `element` is added to the first sublist in `result`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `n` lists with the first list now containing `element`, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**.
