The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The function returns a list called `result`, which contains `n` lists. Each of these lists consists of every `n`th element from the input list `lst`, starting at consecutive indices from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list containing `n` sublists, each created from every `n`th element of `lst` starting from different initial indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist consists of every `n`th element from `lst`, starting at indices from 0 to `n-1`.**
