Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` corresponds to every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from indices 0 through `n-1`. If `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, some sublists may be empty. The function distributes elements from `lst` into these sublists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that all elements are included in the output. This means elements are placed into the sublists based on their index in `lst`, cycling through the `n` sublists. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or if `n` is not a positive integer, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
