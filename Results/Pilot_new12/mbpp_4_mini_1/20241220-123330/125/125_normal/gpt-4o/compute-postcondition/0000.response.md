The variable `result` is assigned a list containing `n` empty lists. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the resulting list will have `n` empty lists nested within it. The state of the variable `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.**
