The code appends `element` to the `n`th list in `result` based on the index calculated by `i % n`. Given that `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the value of `i % n` will be 1 if `n` is greater than 1, or 0 if `n` is equal to 1. The `result` list contains initially `n` lists, and therefore will have sufficient capacity for the append operation. 

The state of `lst`, `n`, `result`, `i`, and `element` remains stable in terms of their definitions, but `result` will now also include `element` in its specified location.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `n` lists with the first list now containing `element`, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, and `result[i % n]` now contains the appended `element`.**
