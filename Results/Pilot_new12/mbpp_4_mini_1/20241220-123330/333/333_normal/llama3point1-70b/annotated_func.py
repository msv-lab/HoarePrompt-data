#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and can be empty.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that may be empty or may contain characters including properly nested and matched parentheses, brackets, and braces. `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating all brackets in 'expression' are matched; otherwise, it returns False, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string parameter `expression` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all opening brackets in the string are properly matched and closed. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening brackets. It returns `True` if all brackets are matched correctly, meaning the stack is empty after processing the string. If any unmatched brackets are detected during processing, or if there is a mismatch (for example, closing a bracket that does not match the most recent opening bracket), it returns `False`. The function effectively handles empty strings, returning `True` since there are no unmatched brackets in that case. Potential edge cases include expressions with no brackets, invalid sequences, or extra closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets.
