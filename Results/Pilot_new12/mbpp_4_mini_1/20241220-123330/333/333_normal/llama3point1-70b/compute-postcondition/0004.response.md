In this code snippet, the `char` variable, which is one of the brackets, is appended to the `stack`, which is initially an empty list. The operation adds `char` to `stack`, so the `stack` now contains one element, which is `char`. The `expression` remains unchanged except it is still valid since it must contain at least 1 character as stated in the precondition.

Output State: **`expression` must contain at least 1 character; `stack` is a list containing `char`; `char` is one of the brackets.**
