Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a string parameter `expression` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all opening brackets in the string are properly matched and closed. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening brackets. It returns `True` if all brackets are matched correctly, meaning the stack is empty after processing the string. If any unmatched brackets are detected during processing, or if there is a mismatch (for example, closing a bracket that does not match the most recent opening bracket), it returns `False`. The function effectively handles empty strings, returning `True` since there are no unmatched brackets in that case. Potential edge cases include expressions with no brackets, invalid sequences, or extra closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets.**
