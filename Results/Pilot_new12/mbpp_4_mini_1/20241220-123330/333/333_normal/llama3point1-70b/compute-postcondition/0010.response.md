Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `brackets`. If `char` is one of the values in `brackets` and matches the last item popped from `stack`, the condition is satisfied. There is no else part, hence no additional state change occurs.***
