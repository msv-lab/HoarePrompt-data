The variable `brackets` is initialized as a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the new definition of `brackets`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and can be empty; `stack` is an empty list; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
