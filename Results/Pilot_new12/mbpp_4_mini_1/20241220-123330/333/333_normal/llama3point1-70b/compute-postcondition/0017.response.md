Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least 1 character. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` is updated to contain `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is not in `brackets`, `stack` remains empty, and if `char` is a value in `brackets.values()`, the function checks if `stack` is empty or if the last popped bracket does not match `char`; if so, it returns False. If neither of these conditions is met, the function proceeds without a return value.***
