The variable `stack` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The initial state indicates that `stack` is an empty list and `char` holds the next character in the `expression`, which must contain at least one character. Therefore, after executing the code, `stack` will contain `char`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` must contain at least 1 character, `char` is the next character in the expression, `stack` is a list containing `char`.**
