According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` contains at least one character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `expression` must contain at least 1 character. Since the `char` is the current character being processed from `expression`, to execute the loop one more time, the next character needs to be taken from `expression`. 

Therefore, if `expression` still has characters remaining after the last character was processed, we can assume that `char` will be assigned the next character, and we will need to adjust our state accordingly. 

State: **`expression` must contain at least 1 character, char is the next character in the expression, stack is an empty list**
