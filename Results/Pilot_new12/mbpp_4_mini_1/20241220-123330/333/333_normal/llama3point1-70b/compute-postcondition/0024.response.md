To analyze the output state after implementing the provided loop, we will evaluate the loop's execution based on the initial variables provided and how they transform through each iteration.

The loop processes each character in the `expression`. The behavior of variables is dependent on whether characters are opening brackets or closing brackets according to the `brackets` mapping.

1. If the `expression` is empty, the loop will not execute, resulting in `stack` remaining an empty list.
2. If any opening brackets are encountered, they will be added to the `stack`.
3. If a closing bracket is encountered, the loop will check if the most recent opening bracket (the last item in `stack`) matches this closing bracket. If there is a mismatch or if `stack` is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, it should trigger a return of `False`.

After looping through the whole `expression`:
- If `stack` is empty at the end, it indicates all brackets were matched.
- If `stack` still contains items, it means there are unmatched opening brackets remaining.

Given this analysis, hereâ€™s the synthesized output state after all iterations:

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may be empty or may contain characters including properly nested and matched parentheses, brackets, and braces. `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets.**
