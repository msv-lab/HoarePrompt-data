The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string that may contain characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and can be empty. Based on the evaluation of the string, if at any point `char` does not correspond to a valid matching bracket in the context of `stack` which is either empty or has a mismatch, the function returns False. Additionally, if certain conditions in the processing of `expression` arise, the function may return False for different cases. Finally, if the `stack` is empty after processing the `expression`, the function returns True, indicating that all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it returns False, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `expression`, and returns True if all brackets in `expression` are matched; returns False if there are unmatched brackets or a mismatch occurs during processing.**
