The code `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char`, which is the character at index 1 of the `expression`, to the `stack`. The initial state specifies that `expression` must contain at least 2 characters, confirming that `char` has a defined value. The values of `expression` and `index` remain unchanged. The state of the `stack` variable is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`expression` must contain at least 2 characters, `char` is the character at index 1, `index` is 1, and `stack` now includes `char`.**
