Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least 1 character. If `char` is one of the brackets, `stack` becomes a list containing `char`. Otherwise, `stack` remains an empty list and `char` is not in `brackets`. If `char` matches the last item popped from `stack`, the condition is satisfied, with no further state change occurring.***
