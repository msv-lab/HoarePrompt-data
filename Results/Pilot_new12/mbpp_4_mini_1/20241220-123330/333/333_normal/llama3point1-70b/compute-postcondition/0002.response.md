According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. The loop iterates through each character in the `expression`. If `expression` is an empty string, the loop will not execute because there are no characters to iterate over. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `expression` should contain at least one character.

Since `stack` is an empty list at the start, it does not affect the execution of the loop. The loop will start with the first character of the `expression`.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, the `expression` must have at least one character. Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect this:

State: **`expression` must contain at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list**
