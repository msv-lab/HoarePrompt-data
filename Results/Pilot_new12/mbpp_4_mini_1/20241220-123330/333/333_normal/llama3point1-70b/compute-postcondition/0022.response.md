Postcondition: ***`expression` must contain at least 2 characters and `char` is the character at index 1. If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the character at the top of the stack does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in state.***
