According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in `expression`. For the loop to execute again, the `char` must be the next character in `expression`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `expression` contains at least 1 character. However, we need to determine what must be true for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will process characters in `expression` one by one, so after the last processed character (let's denote its index as `index`), we need to increment the index to point to the next character.

Given that the loop works with `char` being the current character in `expression`, if the last character processed was at `index`, for the next iteration, the loop would be looking at `index + 1`.

Thus, we require the total length of `expression` to be greater than `index + 1` in order for there to be another character to process.

State: **`expression` must contain at least 2 characters, char is the character at index 1, index is 1**
