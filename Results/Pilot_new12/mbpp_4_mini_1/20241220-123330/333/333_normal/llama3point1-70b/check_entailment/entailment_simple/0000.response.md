Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to check if the given string expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, brackets, and braces. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list called `stack` to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. It also defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through each character in the input string `expression`.

   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket, the program checks:
     - If the stack is empty (indicating no corresponding opening bracket), the function returns `False`, meaning the expression is not balanced.
     - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element (the last unmatched opening bracket) from the stack and checks if it matches the current closing bracket using the `brackets` mapping. If it does not match, the function returns `False`.

3. **Final Check**: After iterating through all characters, the program checks whether the `stack` is empty. If it is empty, this indicates that all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it returns `False`, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets left.

4. **Assumptions**: The program correctly assumes valid input (a string) as stated. It doesnâ€™t explicitly handle invalid types, but the problem description specifies that valid input will be provided.

Thus, considering all aspects of the logic implemented in the program, it aligns with the requirements of the problem description to check if the expression is balanced or not. Hence, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
