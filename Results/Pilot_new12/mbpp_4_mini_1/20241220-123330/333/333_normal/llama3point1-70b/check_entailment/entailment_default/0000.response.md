Explanation: The provided code defines a function that checks whether brackets in the given expression are balanced. It utilizes a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing brackets. According to the output hints, the function correctly checks all potential cases, including handling empty strings by returning `True`, invalid sequences, and extra closing brackets by utilizing the stack for matching.

Upon analyzing the logic, the function correctly returns `True` if all brackets are matched and the stack is empty at the end of the iteration. It returns `False` if there are any unmatched brackets or mismatches encountered during the process.

After closely inspecting potential edge cases, such as strings with various combinations of brackets or strings with no brackets at all, the function performs as expected. Given that the code adheres to the problem description for every potential case, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
