You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a stack-based approach to determine if the given expression containing brackets is balanced. It checks for the following:

1. It utilizes a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. It correctly matches closing brackets with their corresponding opening brackets.
3. If a closing bracket is encountered and there is no corresponding opening bracket in the stack, or if the order of brackets is incorrect, it returns False.
4. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is empty, which indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets.

The implementation seems robust and covers the necessary edge cases, such as:
- An empty string (should return True, as there are no unmatched brackets).
- Strings with no brackets (should also return True).
- Correctly nested brackets (should return True).
- Incorrectly nested or unmatched brackets (should return False).

Considering this comprehensive handling of the problem, I could not find any input or case that caused the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct as per the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and can be empty.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that may be empty or may contain characters including properly nested and matched parentheses, brackets, and braces. `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating all brackets in 'expression' are matched; otherwise, it returns False, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
