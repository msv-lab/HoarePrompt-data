Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly checks if a given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It initializes an empty list `stack` to keep track of opening brackets encountered in the expression.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
3. The program iterates through each character in the input `expression`:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `}`, or `]`), it checks if there is a matching opening bracket at the top of the stack. If there isnâ€™t, or if the brackets do not match, it returns `False`.
4. Finally, the program returns `True` if there are no unmatched opening brackets left in the stack (i.e., `stack` is empty), indicating that the expression is balanced.

This program covers all potential cases for balanced expressions. For instance:
- `"()"` returns `True`
- `"({[]})"` returns `True`
- `"(}"` returns `False` (unmatched brackets)
- `"([)]"` returns `False` (incorrect ordering)

Given the thoroughness of the logic and the handling of various potential cases, the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
