Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a stack-based approach to determine if the given expression containing brackets is balanced. It checks for the following:

1. It utilizes a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. It correctly matches closing brackets with their corresponding opening brackets.
3. If a closing bracket is encountered and there is no corresponding opening bracket in the stack, or if the order of brackets is incorrect, it returns False.
4. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is empty, which indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets.

The implementation seems robust and covers the necessary edge cases, such as:
- An empty string (should return True, as there are no unmatched brackets).
- Strings with no brackets (should also return True).
- Correctly nested brackets (should return True).
- Incorrectly nested or unmatched brackets (should return False).

Considering this comprehensive handling of the problem, I could not find any input or case that caused the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct as per the problem description.
