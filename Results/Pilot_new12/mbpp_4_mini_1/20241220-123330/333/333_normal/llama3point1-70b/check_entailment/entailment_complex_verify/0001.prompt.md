You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly checks if a given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It initializes an empty list `stack` to keep track of opening brackets encountered in the expression.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
3. The program iterates through each character in the input `expression`:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `}`, or `]`), it checks if there is a matching opening bracket at the top of the stack. If there isnâ€™t, or if the brackets do not match, it returns `False`.
4. Finally, the program returns `True` if there are no unmatched opening brackets left in the stack (i.e., `stack` is empty), indicating that the expression is balanced.

This program covers all potential cases for balanced expressions. For instance:
- `"()"` returns `True`
- `"({[]})"` returns `True`
- `"(}"` returns `False` (unmatched brackets)
- `"([)]"` returns `False` (incorrect ordering)

Given the thoroughness of the logic and the handling of various potential cases, the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and can be empty.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that may be empty or may contain characters including properly nested and matched parentheses, brackets, and braces. `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating all brackets in 'expression' are matched; otherwise, it returns False, indicating there are unmatched opening brackets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string parameter `expression` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all opening brackets in the string are properly matched and closed. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening brackets. It returns `True` if all brackets are matched correctly, meaning the stack is empty after processing the string. If any unmatched brackets are detected during processing, or if there is a mismatch (for example, closing a bracket that does not match the most recent opening bracket), it returns `False`. The function effectively handles empty strings, returning `True` since there are no unmatched brackets in that case. Potential edge cases include expressions with no brackets, invalid sequences, or extra closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
