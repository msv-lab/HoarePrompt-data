Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check if a given expression contains properly balanced brackets, including parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. The logic uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets, and it ensures that each closing bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered opening bracket.

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Stack Implementation**: The function utilizes a stack to store opening brackets. Each time an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. This is standard practice for problems dealing with balanced brackets.

2. **Matching Logic**: When a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty (indicating no corresponding opening bracket) and verifies if the last opened bracket matches the current closing bracket by popping the top of the stack and comparing.

3. **Return Value**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (`not stack`), it indicates that all opened brackets have been matched and closed properly, returning `True`. If any unmatched brackets are found, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases Handled:
- An empty string will correctly return `True` since there are no unmatched brackets.
- Strings without any brackets (e.g., "abc") return `True` as well.
- It also correctly handles cases with mismatched or extra closing brackets.

Given that the implementation adheres to the problem description and successfully handles all potential edge cases, we conclude that the code is correct.

Thus, Correctness is affirmed as **True**.
