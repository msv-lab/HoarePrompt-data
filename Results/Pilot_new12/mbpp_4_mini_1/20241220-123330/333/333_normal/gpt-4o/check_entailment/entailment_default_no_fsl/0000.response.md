Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where non-parentheses characters could be present in the input string. According to the output hints, the function is supposed to process a string of parentheses, but it makes an implicit assumption that the input will consist solely of valid parentheses characters.

For example, if the input were to include letters or numbers, such as in the expression `"{()a}[{}]"`, the function would not ignore these non-parentheses characters. Thus, it may produce incorrect results. Since the problem description does not explicitly state that only parentheses characters will be provided, the failure to account for non-parentheses characters reflects a gap in the code's logic. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
