Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to check if the given expression is balanced regarding various types of parentheses: '()', '{}', and '[]'. 

Here's how the program correctly implements this functionality:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `stack` to keep track of the opening parentheses as they are encountered. It also defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` to match each closing parenthesis with its corresponding opening parenthesis.

2. **Loop through characters**: The program iterates over each character in the string `expr`. If it finds an opening parenthesis (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), it pushes it onto the `stack`.

3. **Matching closing parentheses**: When a closing parenthesis is encountered (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), the program checks two conditions:
   - If the `stack` is empty, which would mean there's no corresponding opening parenthesis for the given closing one.
   - If the closing parenthesis does not match the top element of the stack, which indicates that it does not have a proper opening match.

   In either case, the function returns `False`, indicating the expression is unbalanced.

4. **Final check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the `stack` is empty. If it is empty, all opening parentheses have been properly matched with closing ones, and the function returns `True`. If there are any unmatched opening parentheses left in the `stack`, the return value is `False`.

5. **Assumption on input**: The function assumes that the input will strictly consist of valid parentheses characters only. Therefore, it does not handle other types of characters or invalid strings. However, this is acceptable given the problem description's context, as it does not specify handling of non-parentheses characters, thus still complying with the requirements.

The assertions provided also serve to validate the correctness of the implementation against expected outputs for both balanced and unbalanced cases.

Overall, every potential case the function is expected to handle has been adequately addressed, making the program correct as per the described functionality.
