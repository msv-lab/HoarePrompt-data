You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that may contain various types of parentheses such as '()', '{}', and '[]'.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a valid string of parentheses, `stack` is empty, and all parentheses in `expr` are balanced.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True as the 'stack' is empty and all parentheses in 'expr' are balanced
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `expr` that may contain various types of parentheses: '()', '{}', and '[]'. It checks for balanced parentheses within the string. The function iterates through each character in `expr`, using a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it is added to the stack. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening parenthesis. In both cases, the function returns `False`, indicating the parentheses are unbalanced. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (indicating all opening parentheses had a matching closing parenthesis), the function returns `True`, suggesting that the string of parentheses is balanced. However, if there are any unmatched opening parentheses remaining in the stack, the function will return `False`. The function does not handle cases where non-parentheses characters could be present, leading to an assumption that the input will solely consist of valid parentheses characters. The final state indicates whether the parentheses in `expr` are balanced (returns `True`) or not (returns `False`).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
