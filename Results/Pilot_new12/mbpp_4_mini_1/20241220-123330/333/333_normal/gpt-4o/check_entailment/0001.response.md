To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider edge cases:

The function `func_1(expr)` is intended to check if the given expression has balanced parentheses and brackets. The implemented logic uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It correctly pushes opening brackets onto the stack and pops them when encountering their corresponding closing brackets. If a closing bracket does not match the most recent opening bracket (i.e., the one at the top of the stack), it returns `False`. If the stack is empty at the end of processing the string, it returns `True`, indicating that all brackets were balanced.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

1. An empty string input, `""`, should return `True` because there are no unmatched brackets.
2. A string with only opening brackets like `"{{{"` should return `False` because there are no closing brackets to balance.
3. A string with only closing brackets like `"}}}"` should also return `False` for the same reason.
4. Nested combinations like `"{[()]}"` should return `True`, and the same applies to properly nested pairs like `"[{()}]"`.
5. Strings with mismatched types, such as `"{[}"`, should return `False`.

Considering these cases, there is no evidence that the given `func_1` would fail. Checking the original assertions in the program also confirms that they would behave as expected.

After evaluating various inputs and the implementation, we do not find any discrepancies in functionality.

Correctness: **True** 

Explanation: The function correctly handles all observed cases, including nested and mismatched brackets while ensuring the stack is appropriately utilized for tracking.
