You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `expr` that may contain various types of parentheses: '()', '{}', and '[]'. It checks for balanced parentheses within the string. The function iterates through each character in `expr`, using a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it is added to the stack. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening parenthesis. In both cases, the function returns `False`, indicating the parentheses are unbalanced. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (indicating all opening parentheses had a matching closing parenthesis), the function returns `True`, suggesting that the string of parentheses is balanced. However, if there are any unmatched opening parentheses remaining in the stack, the function will return `False`. The function does not handle cases where non-parentheses characters could be present, leading to an assumption that the input will solely consist of valid parentheses characters. The final state indicates whether the parentheses in `expr` are balanced (returns `True`) or not (returns `False`).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
