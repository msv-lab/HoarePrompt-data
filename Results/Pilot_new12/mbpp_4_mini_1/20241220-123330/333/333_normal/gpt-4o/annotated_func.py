#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `expr` that may contain various types of parentheses: '()', '{}', and '[]'. It checks for balanced parentheses within the string. The function iterates through each character in `expr`, using a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it is added to the stack. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening parenthesis. In both cases, the function returns `False`, indicating the parentheses are unbalanced. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (indicating all opening parentheses had a matching closing parenthesis), the function returns `True`, suggesting that the string of parentheses is balanced. However, if there are any unmatched opening parentheses remaining in the stack, the function will return `False`. The function does not handle cases where non-parentheses characters could be present, leading to an assumption that the input will solely consist of valid parentheses characters. The final state indicates whether the parentheses in `expr` are balanced (returns `True`) or not (returns `False`).
