Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` is adjusted appropriately. If `char` is in `matching_pairs` and the stack is empty or the popped element from `stack` does not match the corresponding pair for `char`, the function returns False. If the stack is not empty and the popped element matches, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
