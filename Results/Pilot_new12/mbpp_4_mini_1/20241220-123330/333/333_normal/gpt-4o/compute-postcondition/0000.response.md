The code initializes the variable `stack` as an empty list. The initial state of `expr` remains unchanged since the code only affects the `stack` variable. All other variables and their values, such as `expr`, are still valid and unchanged. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string that may contain various types of parentheses such as '()', '{}', and '[]'; `stack` is an empty list.**
