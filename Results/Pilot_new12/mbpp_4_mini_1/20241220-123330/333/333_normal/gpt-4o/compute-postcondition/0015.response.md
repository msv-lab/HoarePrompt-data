Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` is adjusted appropriately. If `stack` is empty or the popped element from `stack` does not match the corresponding pair for `char`, the function returns False. If neither condition is met, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
