According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expr`. The loop iterates over each character in `expr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `expr` is a non-empty string, and `char` represents the next character to evaluate. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, it means `char` is a character that should be pushed onto the stack. Otherwise, if `char` is not a matching pair, the stack would be adjusted accordingly (by popping elements).

Given that `char` refers to the next character in `expr`, the loop can execute one more time if `expr` still has remaining characters. Since `char` is the next character, we need to identify the current character's position in `expr`.

Letâ€™s assume the current position in `expr` is `pos` and `char` is the character at `pos`. The position of `char` can be incremented by 1 to `pos + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, if there is at least one more character in `expr` beyond the current character, `char` will be updated to the next character in the next iteration. This means that we will have the following adjustments:

1. `expr` must still be a non-empty string.
2. The next `char` will be `expr[pos + 1]`.
3. The stack's state will depend on the current `char` value and any modifications made during the last iteration.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, stack's state adjusted based on the last `char`.**
