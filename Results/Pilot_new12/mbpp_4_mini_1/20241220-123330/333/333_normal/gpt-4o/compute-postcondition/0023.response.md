Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, if `char` is in the values of `matching_pairs`, then the `stack` now contains the previous elements plus `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack's state was adjusted based on the last `char`, and if `char` is in matching pairs, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the popped character from the stack does not match `char`, returning False if either condition is true. If these conditions do not hold, there is no specific return statement executed.***
