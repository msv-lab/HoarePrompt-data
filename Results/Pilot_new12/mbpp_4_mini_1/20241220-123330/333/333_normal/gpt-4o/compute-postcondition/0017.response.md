Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and if `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `stack` includes `char` appended to its previous state. Otherwise, if `char` is not a matching pair, the stack is adjusted accordingly. If `char` is a matching pair and `stack` is empty or the popped element does not match the corresponding pair for `char`, the function returns False. If the stack is not empty and the popped element matches, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
