The code `stack.append(char)` is used to add the variable `char` to the list `stack`. The previous state indicates that `char` is the next character in the string `expr`, which is a non-empty string, and the stack's state has been adjusted based on the last `char`.

During this operation, the stack will now include the value of `char`. Since `char` has a specific value that would be derived from `expr`, the output can now specify that `char` is appended to `stack`.

The state of `expr` remains unchanged, and `char` retains its identity as the next character in `expr`. The stack's state will reflect the addition of this new `char` value.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` now contains the previous elements plus `char`.**
