`stack` is assigned the result of appending `char`. Since `stack` is initially an empty list and `char` is the first character of `expr`, after the code execution, `stack` will contain one element, which is `char`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list containing `char`, `char` is the first character of `expr`, and `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs**.
