Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and the stack's state is adjusted based on the last `char`. If the stack is empty or the popped character from the stack does not match the `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no specific return statement in the else part.***
