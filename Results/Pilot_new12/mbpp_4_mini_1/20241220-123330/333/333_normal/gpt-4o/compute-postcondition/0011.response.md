Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs`, then `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, `stack` remains an empty list and if `char` is found in `matching_pairs`, then `stack` contains at least one element that matches the value from `matching_pairs` for `char`.***
