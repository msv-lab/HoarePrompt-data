To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the conditions in the provided state and the `for` loop:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the non-empty string `expr`. Therefore, the loop will continue to execute for each character until it has gone through every character in `expr`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `char` is the last character processed in the loop. Since `expr` is non-empty, it contains at least one character.
3. The `for char in expr` loop will continue executing until all characters in `expr` have been processed. This means if `char` was processed in the last iteration, the next `char` would be the next character in `expr`.

Given that the loop is using `for char in expr`, we can conclude that:

- If we've processed the last character in `expr`, no more iterations will occur after this. Therefore, we need to ensure that for one more iteration, `char` must refer to the next character in `expr`.
- Since the loop processes the characters in order, if `char` is the last character, the loop cannot run again. On the other hand, if there are more characters to process, we need to adjust to have `char` be the next character in the string.

However, since there is no concrete value to adjust for `char` without additional context (like the length of `expr`), and since `stack`'s condition is based on the character currently being processed, we focus on what relates to the character and the states involved.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` must be appropriately adjusted if `char` is in `matching_pairs`**
