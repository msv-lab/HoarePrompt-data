Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`, `char` is not one of the values in `matching_pairs`, and now `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs`. The stack is either empty or the last element popped from the stack does not match the corresponding value in `matching_pairs` for `char`.***
