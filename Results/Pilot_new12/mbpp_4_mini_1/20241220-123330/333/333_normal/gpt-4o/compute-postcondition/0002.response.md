According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. For the loop to execute, `expr` must not be an empty string. If `expr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. 

At the beginning of the first iteration, the variables are:
- `stack` is an empty list, which means it will be ready to store any opening parentheses encountered.
- `char` will need to represent the first character of `expr` during the iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `expr` must contain at least one character (preferably a parenthesis), and `char` is the first character in `expr`.

State: **`expr` is a string that must not be empty, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`**
