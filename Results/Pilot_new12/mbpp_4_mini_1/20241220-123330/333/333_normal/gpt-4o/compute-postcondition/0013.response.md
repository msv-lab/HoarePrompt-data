The value of `char` is added to `stack` through the `append` method. Given that `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` will now include this new character. The previous state of `expr`, `char`, and `stack` varies based on their initial definitions, but since `char` is a valid character in `expr` and we are told to respect the existing state of the stack in conjunction with the matching rules, we will only update the state of `stack` with no changes to `expr` or `char`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` includes `char` appended to its previous state.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` includes `char` appended to its previous state.**
