Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and the stack's state was adjusted based on the last `char`. If `char` is in matching pairs, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the popped character from the stack does not match `char`, and if either condition is true, it returns False. If these conditions do not hold, no specific return statement is executed.***
