Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of comparable elements. It checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. The function returns True if the list is sorted and False otherwise. It does not handle any special cases explicitly, such as empty lists or lists with a single element, but logically these cases would return True since an empty list and a single-element list are both considered sorted. There is no error handling for non-list inputs, and the function assumes the input is always a list of comparable elements.**
