Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function fulfills the requirements and handles all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with a single element since both are inherently sorted. The output hints also confirm that the program logically behaves as expected, producing `True` for sorted lists and `False` for unsorted ones, without any errors for valid input lists. Thus, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
