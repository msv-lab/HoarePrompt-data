Correctness: **True**.

The function checks if the given list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. If they are the same, the list is sorted; otherwise, it is not. It handles all potential cases including empty lists and lists with one element, as these are inherently sorted. In all scenarios, the comparison with the sorted function adequately determines whether the list is sorted or not, meeting the problem description's requirements.
