Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. Here's an explanation of how it meets the description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of comparable elements.

2. **Sorting Check**: The line `return nums == sorted(nums)` directly checks if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. If `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order, this expression will evaluate to `True`; otherwise, it will evaluate to `False`.

3. **Correctness**: The function efficiently determines if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This logic correctly reflects whether the list is in sorted order, satisfying the requirement of the problem description.

4. **Assumptions**: The statement acknowledges that the input will be valid (i.e., a list), thus no additional error handling for invalid inputs is required.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality requested in the problem description, confirming that it behaves as expected in checking if a list is sorted.
