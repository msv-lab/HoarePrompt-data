Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly determines whether a list of comparable elements is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the input list `nums` with a sorted version of itself. In terms of functionality:

1. If `nums` is an empty list, it returns `True` because an empty list is considered sorted.
2. If `nums` contains a single element, it also returns `True` since a single-element list is trivially sorted.
3. For longer lists, it accurately checks whether the list is sorted by leveraging Python's built-in `sorted` function.

The output hints correctly state that the function handles these basic cases implicitly. Additionally, as per the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements, the lack of error handling for non-list inputs does not render the function incorrect.

Overall, the function meets the requirements set out in the problem description for all potential valid cases.
