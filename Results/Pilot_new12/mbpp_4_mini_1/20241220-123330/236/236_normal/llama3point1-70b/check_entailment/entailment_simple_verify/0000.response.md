Based on the problem description, the program aims to determine whether a specified list is sorted. The original assessment claims the program's correctness is **True**, explaining that the function returns `True` if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version, implying it handles all edge cases appropriately.

The annotated version confirms that right before the function call, `nums` is a list of comparable elements, indicating appropriate input handling. After the function call, it reiterates that the function checks if `nums` is sorted, which aligns with the problem description.

Given all the provided information in the assessment, including annotations revealing that the function satisfactorily checks the sorted condition of the list, the original assessment remains valid. The function addresses all necessary scenarios, including handling of single-element and empty lists, which are naturally sorted. There is no indication from the annotations that the function behaves incorrectly for the valid input that it assumes.

Final: **True**
