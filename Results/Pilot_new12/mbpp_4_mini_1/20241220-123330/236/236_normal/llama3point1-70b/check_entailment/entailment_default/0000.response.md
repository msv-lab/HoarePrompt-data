Explanation: The provided function `func_1` aims to check whether a list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does so by comparing the list to its sorted version using `sorted(nums)`, which is a valid approach. According to the output hints, the function returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, and it logically handles specific cases such as empty lists or single-element lists, both of which are sorted. 

Given the assumptions that the input is always a valid list of comparable elements, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
