Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly checks whether the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. The reasoning behind the assessment aligns with the output hints, which confirm that the function logically handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, both of which are considered sorted. Additionally, the function's reliance on the assumption that the input will be a valid list of comparable elements does not detract from its correctness in the context of the problem description. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and performs as expected across all tested cases.
