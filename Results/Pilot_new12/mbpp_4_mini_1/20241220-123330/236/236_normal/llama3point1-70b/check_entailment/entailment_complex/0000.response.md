Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements as defined in the problem description. It checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function accepts a list of comparable elements (`nums`) and returns `True` if `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version produced by the `sorted()` function. If the list is not sorted, it returns `False`.

2. **Special Cases**: The annotations confirm that the behavior for special cases (such as an empty list or a list with a single element) is implicitly handled. An empty list and a single-element list are defined to be sorted, which means the function will correctly return `True` for both cases. 

3. **Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements. Therefore, there is no need to handle cases of invalid input types or contents, as the task specifies to examine only the correctness of handling a list.

Thus, the function meets the requirements set by the problem description and behaves correctly for all potential valid input cases as per the assumptions made. Consequently, the answer is True.
