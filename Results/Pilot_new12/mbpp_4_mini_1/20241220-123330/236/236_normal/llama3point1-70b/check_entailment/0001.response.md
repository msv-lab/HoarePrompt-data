Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted. It uses the `sorted()` function to create a new sorted version of the input list `nums` and then compares it to the original list. This approach works for all potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with one element is also sorted.
3. **Already Sorted List**: The function will return `True` for lists that are already sorted in ascending order.
4. **Unsorted List**: The function will return `False` for lists that are not sorted.

Since the program handles all these scenarios correctly, there are no potential cases where it fails to meet the problem description.
