#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that must be sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, and the function returns True if the loop has iterated through all pairs of adjacent elements in `lst` without finding any pair where the first element is greater than the second.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all pairs of adjacent elements in the list 'lst' have been checked and are in non-decreasing order, as 'i' is less than 'len(lst) - 1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through pairs of adjacent elements. If it finds any pair where the first element is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration through all pairs without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. However, the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. In these cases, it will return `True`, which generally aligns with the expectation that an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.
