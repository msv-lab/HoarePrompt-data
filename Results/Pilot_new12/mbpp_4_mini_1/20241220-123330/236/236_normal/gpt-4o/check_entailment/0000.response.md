Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such elements are found, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions are adequate tests for the function, as they check for both sorted and unsorted cases. All edge cases, such as an already sorted list and lists with a descending order, have been considered.

Here's why the code is correct:
- For a sorted list, the loop completes without finding any pair where an earlier number is greater than a later number, hence it returns `True`.
- For an unsorted list (for example, `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`), the loop will find `20 > 17` and return `False`.
- An empty list or a single-element list is implicitly handled correctly by the function, as there will be no iterations through the loop, resulting in a return of `True`.

Thus, based on the analysis of the function, it meets all requirements of the problem description.
