Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the logic to determine if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The reasoning in the original assessment aligns with the provided output hints, which confirm that the function checks each adjacent pair of elements and returns `True` only if no elements violate the sorting condition.

The program adheres to the problem description and is capable of handling valid input types, returning `True` for an empty list or a single-element list, which is aligned with the general understanding that these cases are considered sorted. Despite the output hints noting that the handling of edge cases could be made explicit, the current behavior of the function is consistent with the expectations set by the problem description.

Thus, based on the thorough analysis and the functionality described, the program meets the requirements, and the original assessment stands correct.
