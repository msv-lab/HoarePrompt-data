Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of the problem description to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's a breakdown of why the implementation meets the criteria outlined in the problem description:

1. **Iterative Comparison**: The function loops through each adjacent pair of elements in the list `lst`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If any such condition is found, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

2. **Completed Iteration**: If the loop completes without finding any adjacent pair where the first element is greater than the second, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function implicitly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a single-element list, which should be considered sorted. Both of these cases will satisfy the loop's range condition (`len(lst) - 1` is less than 0), leading to the function returning `True`.

4. **Correct Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotations test various scenarios, including a sorted list, a reverse-sorted list, and a partially sorted list. The results of these assertions align with the expected behavior of the function.

The function adheres to the specifications in the problem description and is correctly implemented to determine the sorted status of a list, thus validating its correctness.
