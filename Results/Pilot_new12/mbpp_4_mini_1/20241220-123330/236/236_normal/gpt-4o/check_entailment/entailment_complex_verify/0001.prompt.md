You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next). The provided implementation covers all necessary logic:

1. It iterates through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element using a for loop.
2. For each element, it compares it with the next element.
3. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the subsequent element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, showing the list is sorted.

The assertions also test various scenarios:
- A fully sorted list returns `True`.
- A list that becomes unsorted by having a higher number followed by a smaller number returns `False`.
- Another mixed list returns `False` correctly.

Given the above points and the covered cases, I cannot identify any edge cases where the program fails to meet the described requirements. Hence, I conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that must be sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, and the function returns True if the loop has iterated through all pairs of adjacent elements in `lst` without finding any pair where the first element is greater than the second.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all pairs of adjacent elements in the list 'lst' have been checked and are in non-decreasing order, as 'i' is less than 'len(lst) - 1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through pairs of adjacent elements. If it finds any pair where the first element is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration through all pairs without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. However, the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. In these cases, it will return `True`, which generally aligns with the expectation that an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
