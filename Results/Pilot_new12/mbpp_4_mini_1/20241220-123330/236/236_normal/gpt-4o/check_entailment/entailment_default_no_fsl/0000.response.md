Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order correctly for lists containing multiple elements. However, it does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. While it is generally accepted that an empty list is sorted and a single-element list is also sorted, the function's output for these cases is not explicitly defined in the description or the assertions. 

The code explicitly asserts that lists such as `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` would return `True` and that lists like `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` would return `False` correctly. However, it might lead to ambiguity if, for example, the function is called with an empty list `[]` or a single-element list like `[3]`, even though it would return `True` for both cases, it lacks coverage in the initial problem description regarding those edge cases.

Therefore, since the function does not address all potential cases according to the problem description, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
