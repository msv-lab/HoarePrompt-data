You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such elements are found, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions are adequate tests for the function, as they check for both sorted and unsorted cases. All edge cases, such as an already sorted list and lists with a descending order, have been considered.

Here's why the code is correct:
- For a sorted list, the loop completes without finding any pair where an earlier number is greater than a later number, hence it returns `True`.
- For an unsorted list (for example, `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`), the loop will find `20 > 17` and return `False`.
- An empty list or a single-element list is implicitly handled correctly by the function, as there will be no iterations through the loop, resulting in a return of `True`.

Thus, based on the analysis of the function, it meets all requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through pairs of adjacent elements. If it finds any pair where the first element is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration through all pairs without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. However, the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. In these cases, it will return `True`, which generally aligns with the expectation that an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
