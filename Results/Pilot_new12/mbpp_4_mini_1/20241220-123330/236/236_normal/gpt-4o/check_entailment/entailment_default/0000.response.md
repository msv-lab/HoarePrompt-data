The code appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly identifies whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through each adjacent pair of elements. If it finds that the first element is greater than the second, it returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The output hints also mention that the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. However, since it is natural to consider both an empty list and a single-element list as sorted, the function correctly returns `True` in those cases as well.

Thus, after reviewing the functionality and confirming it adheres to the problem requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
