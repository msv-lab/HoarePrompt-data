Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's the reasoning behind why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst)` aims to check if the list `lst` is sorted. The problem description explicitly states that the function must check whether a specified list is sorted, which the program does.

2. **Logic**: The implementation uses a for loop to iterate over the list elements. It checks adjacent pairs of elements (i.e., `lst[i]` and `lst[i + 1]`) to ensure that each element is not greater than the next. If any such pair is found where the first element is greater than the second, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Return Values**: If the loop completes without finding any unordered pair, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test the function with different inputs:
   - An ascending sorted list returns `True`.
   - A list where a value decreases returns `False`.
   - Another unsorted list returns `False`. 
   All test cases validate the correctness of the function's output against expected results.

5. **Conditions and Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input will always be valid, which aligns with the given instructions that valid inputs will be provided. Therefore, even though the function does not explicitly handle cases of empty lists or non-list inputs, it adheres to the specified requirements under the assumption of valid input.

Overall, the program implements the logic required by the problem description effectively and returns the correct results for the specified cases, hence it is deemed correct.
