Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order, as described. The logic correctly compares adjacent elements and identifies whether the list is sorted or not. The assertions provided cover various scenarios such as completely sorted lists and those with elements out of order, which reaffirm its functionality.

The output hints clarify that the function's design inherently accepts edge cases like an empty list or a single-element list, where it returns `True`, aligning with the expected behavior that such cases are considered sorted. Moreover, it does not contradict the requirements stated in the problem description.

Consequently, the function meets the problem requirements and handles expected inputs correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
