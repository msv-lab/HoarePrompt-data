Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next). The provided implementation covers all necessary logic:

1. It iterates through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element using a for loop.
2. For each element, it compares it with the next element.
3. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the subsequent element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, showing the list is sorted.

The assertions also test various scenarios:
- A fully sorted list returns `True`.
- A list that becomes unsorted by having a higher number followed by a smaller number returns `False`.
- Another mixed list returns `False` correctly.

Given the above points and the covered cases, I cannot identify any edge cases where the program fails to meet the described requirements. Hence, I conclude that the code is correct.
