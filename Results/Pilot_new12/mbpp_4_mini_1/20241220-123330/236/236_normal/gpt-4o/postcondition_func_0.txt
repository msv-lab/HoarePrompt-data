The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through pairs of adjacent elements. If it finds any pair where the first element is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration through all pairs without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. However, the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty list or a single-element list. In these cases, it will return `True`, which generally aligns with the expectation that an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.
