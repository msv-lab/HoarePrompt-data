The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be of any comparable type. After executing the function body, the following cases are considered: 

- Case_1: If the current value of `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not in non-decreasing order.
- Case_2: The function returns `False`, indicating some other condition of the list.
- Case_3: The function returns `False`, indicating a different condition of the list.
- Case_4: If all pairs of adjacent elements in the list have been checked and are in non-decreasing order, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and check if all the adjacent pairs of elements are in non-decreasing order. If any pair is found in the wrong order, it returns `False`; if the list is verified to be in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of any comparable types, and returns True if all adjacent pairs are in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False.**
