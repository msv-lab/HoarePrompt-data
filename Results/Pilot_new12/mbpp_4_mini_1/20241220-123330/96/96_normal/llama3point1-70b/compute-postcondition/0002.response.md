Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` that can contain elements of any data type. It checks whether all the elements within the tuple are of the same data type. The function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. It does not handle any specific edge cases such as an empty tuple or non-tuple input, as the code assumes valid input is always provided. Therefore, while it functions correctly for standard cases, it would require additional handling to address edge cases like empty tuples or non-tuple inputs.**
