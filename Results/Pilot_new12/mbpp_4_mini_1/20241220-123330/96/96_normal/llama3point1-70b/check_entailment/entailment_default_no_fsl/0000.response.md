Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct as it does not handle the edge case of an empty tuple. According to the problem description, the function should check if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type; however, if the input tuple is empty, the code will return `True` because `len(set())` is `0`, which does not align with the expectation that an empty tuple should not have a consistent data type among its elements. Therefore, this situation is a case where the function does not behave as required by the problem description.
