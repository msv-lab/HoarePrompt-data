Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement: it checks whether all elements in the input tuple `tup` are of the same data type. The use of a set to collect the types is an effective method to determine type uniformity.

The provided output hints, while acknowledging that the function does not handle specific edge cases such as empty tuples or non-tuple inputs, confirm that the assumptions about valid input will be met. Since the problem description allows for valid inputs and does not specify the necessity to handle empty tuples specifically, the function behaves as intended under the assumption that the input tuple is valid.

Therefore, based on the correct application of the logic within the function and the alignment with the problem description, I maintain that the program is correct.
