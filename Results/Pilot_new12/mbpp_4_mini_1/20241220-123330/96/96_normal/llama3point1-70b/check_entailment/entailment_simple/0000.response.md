Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement detailed in the problem description, which asks for a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
2. The comprehension `(type(x) for x in tup)` generates the data types of each element in the tuple.
3. The `set` function then creates a set of these types, which means that all duplicate types will be removed, leaving only unique types.
4. The length of this set is checked. If it equals 1, it means that all elements in the tuple are of the same data type (since only one unique type exists). If the length is greater than 1, then there are different data types present.

Thus, the function will return `True` if all elements share the same type and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the problem's request. We also assume that valid input is provided, so the implementation correctly follows the specifications laid out in the problem description.
