Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` uses a set comprehension to collect the types of all elements in the input tuple `tup`. By checking if the length of this set is equal to 1, the function verifies whether all elements share the same data type. 

This logic works correctly for several cases:
1. If the input tuple contains elements of the same type (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`), the function will return `True`.
2. If the input tuple contains different data types (e.g., `(1, 'a', 3.0)`), the function will correctly return `False`.
3. Edge cases such as an empty tuple `()` will return `True`, as there are no elements to contradict the data type uniformity.

Given this reasoning, I cannot identify any input or edge case where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
