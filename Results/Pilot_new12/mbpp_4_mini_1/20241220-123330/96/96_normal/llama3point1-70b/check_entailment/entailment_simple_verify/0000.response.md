Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The annotations reinforce this logic by explicitly stating that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same data type and `False` otherwise. The function behaves as expected for various cases, including edge cases like an empty tuple, which aligns with the problem description's requirements. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to confirm that the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
