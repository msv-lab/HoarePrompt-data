Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code does check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, returning `True` if they do and `False` otherwise. However, the output hints suggest that the code does not handle edge cases such as an empty tuple or when the input is not a tuple. For an empty tuple, `set()` would return an empty set, and the length of that set would be 0, which would incorrectly lead to a return value of `True`. This means the function would give a false positive in the case of an empty tuple. Since it does not account for this edge case, the program fails to meet the specifications outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
