You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It accomplishes this by creating a set of types from each element in the tuple and verifying if the length of this set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all elements are of the same type; otherwise, they are not.

I have considered various potential cases:
1. A tuple with all elements of the same type (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)` or `(True, False)`).
2. A tuple with mixed types (e.g., `(1, '2', 3.0)`).
3. An empty tuple `()` which should ideally return `True`, since there are no elements to contradict the "same type" statement.

All cases function correctly, and the program meets the problem requirements without any missing logic or edge cases. Thus, the program is consistent with the problem description for all conceivable cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` that can contain elements of any data type. It checks whether all the elements within the tuple are of the same data type. The function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. It does not handle any specific edge cases such as an empty tuple or non-tuple input, as the code assumes valid input is always provided. Therefore, while it functions correctly for standard cases, it would require additional handling to address edge cases like empty tuples or non-tuple inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
