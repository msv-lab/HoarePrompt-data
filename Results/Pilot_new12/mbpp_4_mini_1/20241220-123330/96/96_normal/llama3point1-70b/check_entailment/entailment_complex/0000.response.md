Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all elements in a given tuple `tup` are of the same data type.

Here's how the implementation matches the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) which can contain elements of any data type, aligning with the requirement specified in the problem description.

2. **Processing**: The function utilizes a set comprehension to collect the types of all elements in the tuple. The use of `set` ensures that only unique types are stored. By checking if the length of this set is equal to 1 (`len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1`), the function effectively determines if all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

3. **Output**: The function returns `True` if all elements are of the same data type and `False` otherwise. This behavior is explicitly stated in the annotations, matching the requirement that the function should ascertain if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type.

Although the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty tuple or non-tuple inputs, the problem description assumes valid inputs. Therefore, the absence of such checks does not lead to the conclusion that it is incorrect, as per the provided criteria for assessing correctness under the assumption of valid input.

In summary, the function meets the outlined requirements of the problem description, making the answer correct.
