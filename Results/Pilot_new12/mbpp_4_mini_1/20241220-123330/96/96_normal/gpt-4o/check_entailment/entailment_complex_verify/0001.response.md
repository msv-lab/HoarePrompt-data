Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately concludes that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The program correctly identifies if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, as illustrated by the assertions provided for testing.

The reasoning provided in the original assessment aligns well with the annotated version of the code:

1. The function accounts for the case of an empty tuple, returning `True` as expected.
2. The type of the first element is stored and used for comparison against the types of the remaining elements.
3. It logically returns `False` if a mismatch in types is found and returns `True` if all types match.

The annotated states further confirm that the program maintains its logic and accurately checks the homogeneity of types within the tuple, without falling into any unhandled edge cases.

Given all relevant evidence and reasoning confirms that `func_1` fulfills the given requirements, the conclusion of the original assessment remains valid. Thus, the program is correct.
