Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the elements in the input tuple have the same data type. Here's how it works:

1. The function starts by checking if the tuple is empty. If it is empty, it returns `True`, which is a sensible assumption since there are no elements to check.
2. It stores the type of the first element in the variable `first_type`.
3. It then iterates over each element in the tuple and compares its type with `first_type`.
4. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`, indicating not all elements are of the same type.
5. If all elements are of the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions also cover typical use cases, including:
- All integer types.
- Mixed integer and string types.
- More integers.

Given that I cannot find any potential cases where the function would return an incorrect result for the problem description, it qualifies as correct.
