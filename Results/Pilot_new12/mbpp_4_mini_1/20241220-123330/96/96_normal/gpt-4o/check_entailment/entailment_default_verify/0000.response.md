Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to check if all elements in the input tuple have the same data type, in accordance with the problem description. The function appropriately handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is consistent with the expectations of type homogeneity since there are no elements to compare. 

The output hints confirm that the function performs as expected, outlining that it returns `True` for an empty tuple and checks the types of elements against the type of the first element. It also notes that the function returns `False` when differing types are present, which matches the examples provided in the assertions.

Furthermore, the output hints mention no missing edge cases, indicating that all typical scenarios where the function might be tested are covered. Given all this supporting evidence, the conclusion of the original assessment holds: the function meets the problem description's requirements and the expected behavior outlined in the output hints.
