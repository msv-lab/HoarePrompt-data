Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` checks whether all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same data type. It returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements share the same type as the first element.

2. **Handling Empty Tuples**: According to the problem statement, an empty tuple is handled correctly and returns `True`, indicating that there are no elements of differing types. This behavior matches the requirement to check types, as an empty tuple has no elements to compare.

3. **Type Comparison**: The program iterates over each element in the tuple and compares its type with the type of the first element. If any element has a different type, the function returns `False`, which signifies that the tuple does not meet the requirement of having the same data type for all its elements.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` only if all elements are of the same type or if the tuple is empty. This aligns perfectly with the question's expectation to determine whether all elements have the same data type.

5. **Testing**: The assertions provided in the annotated code confirm that the function behaves correctly in various scenarios, including both homogenous and heterogenous tuples.

Overall, all specifications laid out in the problem description are met by the function implementation, and it handles the expected cases as anticipated. Therefore, the conclusion is that the implementation is correct.
