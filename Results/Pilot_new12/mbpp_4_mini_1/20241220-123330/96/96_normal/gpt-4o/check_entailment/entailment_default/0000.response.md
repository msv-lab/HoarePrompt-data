Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it meets all the requirements set out in the problem description. The function checks if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. It first handles the edge case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`. Then, it compares the type of each element in the tuple to the type of the first element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The output hints also support this, confirming that the function behaves correctly for various inputs, including the specified examples.

Correctness: **True**.
