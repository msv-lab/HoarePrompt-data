To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to assess whether the implementation of `func_1` satisfies the requirement of checking if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type.

Here's the breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Check for Empty Tuple:** 
   - The function first checks if the given tuple `tup` is empty. If it is empty, the function returns `True`. This is logically consistent since there are no elements with differing types in an empty tuple.

2. **Determining the Type of the First Element:**
   - The function assigns the type of the first element of the tuple to the variable `first_type`.

3. **Iterating Through the Tuple:**
   - The function then iterates through each element in the tuple `tup`.
   - For each element, it checks if the type of that element is equal to `first_type`. If any element is found that does not match `first_type`, the function returns `False`.

4. **Return Value After Loop:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatched types, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

Based on this logic, let's analyze how the function behaves concerning the problem description:

- The function correctly identifies when a tuple is empty and returns `True`, which is in line with the requirement since there are no elements to differ in type.
- For non-empty tuples, the function guarantees that it will return `True` only if all elements have the same data type, complying with the task of checking data types within the tuple.

The function passed all the assertions provided in the sample tests, further confirming its correctness for the specified cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness result is:

Correctness: **True**
