You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. 

1. It first checks if the tuple is empty. According to the logic in the problem statement, an empty tuple is considered to have "same data type" elements since there are no elements to compare - hence it returns `True`.
2. It stores the type of the first element in `first_type`.
3. It iterates through each element in the tuple and compares its type with `first_type`.
4. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
5. If all elements have the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions test various cases, including:
- A tuple of integers where all types match (returns `True`).
- A tuple of mixed integers and a string where types do not match (returns `False`).
- Another tuple of integers where all types match (returns `True`).

No potential edge cases were found that the program does not handle correctly. Thus, the program seems to meet the problem description properly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if `tup` is empty or if all elements within `tup` are of the same type as the first element (`tup[0]`). If the tuple contains elements of differing types, it returns `False`. The state after execution confirms that if `tup` is empty, it successfully indicates this scenario; if it contains elements, it verifies the homogeneity of types among them. There are no missing edge cases identified in the current implementation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
