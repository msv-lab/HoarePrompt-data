Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. It verifies the following conditions as described in the problem:

1. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, which is the expected behavior as stated in the output hints.
2. It checks the data type of each element in the tuple against the data type of the first element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
3. If all elements are of the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions confirm its correctness against specified test cases, covering the cases where tuples are comprised of uniform data types and mixed types. Since it correctly handles all potential cases outlined in the problem description and hints, the program is accurate in its implementation.
