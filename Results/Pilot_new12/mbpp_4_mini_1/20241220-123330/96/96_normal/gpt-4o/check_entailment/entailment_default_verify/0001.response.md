Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` fulfills the problem description of checking whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The presence of assertions demonstrates the function has been adequately tested against various cases, confirming its expected behavior, including how it responds to an empty tuple. The output hints further support this assessment by articulating the function's behavior clearly and confirming that no edge cases have been overlooked. Thus, the function appears to operate correctly in accordance with the described requirements.
