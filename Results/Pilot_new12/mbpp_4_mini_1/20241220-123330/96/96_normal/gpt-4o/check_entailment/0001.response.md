Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. 

1. It first checks if the tuple is empty. According to the logic in the problem statement, an empty tuple is considered to have "same data type" elements since there are no elements to compare - hence it returns `True`.
2. It stores the type of the first element in `first_type`.
3. It iterates through each element in the tuple and compares its type with `first_type`.
4. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
5. If all elements have the same type, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions test various cases, including:
- A tuple of integers where all types match (returns `True`).
- A tuple of mixed integers and a string where types do not match (returns `False`).
- Another tuple of integers where all types match (returns `True`).

No potential edge cases were found that the program does not handle correctly. Thus, the program seems to meet the problem description properly.
