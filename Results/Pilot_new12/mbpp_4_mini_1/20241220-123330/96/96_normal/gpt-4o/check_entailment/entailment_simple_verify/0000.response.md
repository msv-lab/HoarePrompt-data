Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the problem description of checking if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. 

The annotations support this conclusion by clearly outlining the states of the program at various points:
1. The function handles empty tuples correctly by returning `True`, which is appropriate since there are no elements to compare.
2. It accurately determines the data type of the first element and compares it against the remaining elements in the tuple.
3. If a mismatch in data types is found, it returns `False`, and if all are the same, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions also confirm the function's correctness for typical cases, ensuring that the implementation works as required by the problem statement. Thus, the overall correctness of the program is supported by both the annotations and the assertions.
