Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any data type with at least 2 elements, where `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, and `element` is `tup[1]`. If `element` is not of the same type as `first_type`, the function returns False. If `element` is of the same type as `first_type`, no value is returned from the function.***
