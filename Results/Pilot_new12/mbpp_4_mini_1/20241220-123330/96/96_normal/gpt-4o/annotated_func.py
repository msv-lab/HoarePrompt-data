#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution without any direct reliance on the contents of the empty tuple `tup`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tup` is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type, and `tup` is not empty.
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple containing elements of the same type as `tup[0]`, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, and the loop completes without returning False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the loop completed successfully without returning False, and that all elements in the tuple 'tup' are of the same type as 'tup[0]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if `tup` is empty or if all elements within `tup` are of the same type as the first element (`tup[0]`). If the tuple contains elements of differing types, it returns `False`. The state after execution confirms that if `tup` is empty, it successfully indicates this scenario; if it contains elements, it verifies the homogeneity of types among them. There are no missing edge cases identified in the current implementation.
