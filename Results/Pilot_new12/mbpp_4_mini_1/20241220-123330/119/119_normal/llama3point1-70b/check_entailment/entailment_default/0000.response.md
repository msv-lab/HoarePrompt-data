Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly takes two input parameters `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple with `b` first and `a` second. The output hints accurately summarize the behavior of the function, stating that it returns the values swapped without any additional operations or validations. As per the problem description, there are no specific edge cases defined that need handling; thus, as long as valid inputs are provided, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, making it correct.
