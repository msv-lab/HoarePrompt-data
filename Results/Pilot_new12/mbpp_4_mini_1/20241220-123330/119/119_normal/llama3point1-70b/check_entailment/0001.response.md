Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement from the problem description. It takes two numbers as inputs and returns a tuple where the second number is first, followed by the first number. 

For any inputs `a` and `b`, the function `func_1(a, b)` will return `(b, a)`, which adheres to the specified behavior. Testing it with different examples such as:

- `func_1(1, 2)` will return `(2, 1)`
- `func_1(-1, 5)` will return `(5, -1)`
- `func_1(0, 0)` will return `(0, 0)`

In all these cases, the output remains consistent with the expected result described in the problem statement. Thus, the function works as intended across all potential inputs.
