Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two arguments `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple with the second argument `b` first, followed by the first argument `a`. This is exactly what the problem description specifies: to return a tuple with the second number and then the first number. There are no cases in which the function would fail to meet this specification, assuming valid input as stated in the assumptions. Therefore, the program is correct.
