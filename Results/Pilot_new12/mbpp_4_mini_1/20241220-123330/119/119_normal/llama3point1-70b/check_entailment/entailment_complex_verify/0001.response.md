Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description, which specifies that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The implementation of the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly performs this operation by returning `(b, a)`.

The original assessment accurately noted that for any inputs `a` and `b`, the function returns the correct tuple format. The behavior is consistent across various test cases provided, confirming that it adheres to the expected output regardless of the specific values of `a` and `b`.

The annotated version reinforces this correctness by clarifying that the function generates output in the order of `b` and then `a`, with no additional behavior that could introduce any errors or edge cases affecting the intended functionality.

Thus, the function operates as per the requirement established in the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness stands valid.
