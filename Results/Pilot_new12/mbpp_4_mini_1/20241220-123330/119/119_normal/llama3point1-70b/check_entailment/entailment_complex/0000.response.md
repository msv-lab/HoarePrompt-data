Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it fulfills the requirement outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1(a, b)` takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`. This is exactly what the problem specifies: to return a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

The code comments accurately describe the behavior of the function, stating that it effectively swaps the order of the two inputs in the output, which aligns with the problem statement.

Additionally, there are no constraints or requirements in the problem description regarding how the function should handle different types of inputs or edge cases, as we assume that the input will always be valid. Therefore, since the function performs the required task as described without any deviations, it can be deemed correct.
