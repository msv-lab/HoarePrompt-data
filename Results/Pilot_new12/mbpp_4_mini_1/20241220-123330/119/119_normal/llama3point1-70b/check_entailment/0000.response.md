Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly takes in two numbers and returns them in a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, as specified in the problem description. For any inputs given to the function `func_1(a, b)`, it will always produce the expected output format `(b, a)`. Since all potential cases align with the requirements of the description, the program works as intended.
