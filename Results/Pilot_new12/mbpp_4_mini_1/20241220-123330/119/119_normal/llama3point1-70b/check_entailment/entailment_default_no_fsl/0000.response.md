Correctness: **True**

The function correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that it should take two numbers (or any values) and return them in a tuple with the second number first followed by the first number. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended without performing additional operations or validations. Since the input is assumed to be valid as per the specifications, the function will always produce the correct output for any valid input. No edge cases that lead to failure of the program have been identified based on the provided information.
