The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be any two values. After executing the function body, it returns the values in the order of `b` followed by `a`, effectively swapping their order in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two values, `a` and `b`, and return them in swapped order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b` and returns the values in the order of `b` followed by `a`.**
