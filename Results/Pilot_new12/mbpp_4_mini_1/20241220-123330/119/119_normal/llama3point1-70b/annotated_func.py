#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any two values.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, effectively swapping their order in the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`. There are no additional operations or validation performed on the input values, and it directly outputs the swapped values regardless of their types or contents. The code does not handle any specific edge cases, such as handling None values or differing data types, and assumes both parameters will be provided.
