Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program is correct, but the output hints indicate that the function does not perform any validation on the input parameters. While the function correctly returns a tuple of (b, a) for valid (numeric) inputs, it fails to handle other potential input types according to the output hints. The function may produce unexpected results or errors when provided with non-numeric types, None, or other edge cases, which the problem description does not clarify it would handle. 

Thus, the lack of input validation makes the function not fully compliant with potential input variations that may be presented to it, as promised in the output hints. Therefore, the assessment of correctness should be revised.
