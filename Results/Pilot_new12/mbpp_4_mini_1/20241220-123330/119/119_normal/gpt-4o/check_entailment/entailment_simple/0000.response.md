Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` is designed to take in two numbers (which can be either integers or floats), and it correctly returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number.

The annotations and assertions demonstrate that the function correctly handles a variety of inputs:
- For the input `(10, 20)`, it returns `(20, 10)`.
- For the input `(15, 17)`, it returns `(17, 15)`.
- For the input `(100, 200)`, it returns `(200, 100)`.

In each case, the returned tuple adheres to the requirement of placing the second input before the first in the result. The implementation of the function directly corresponds to the operation described in the problem statement.

Since we assume valid inputs, there are no scenarios in which the function would fail to meet the given requirements. Therefore, the program is correct, and it consistently fulfills the criteria outlined in the problem description.
