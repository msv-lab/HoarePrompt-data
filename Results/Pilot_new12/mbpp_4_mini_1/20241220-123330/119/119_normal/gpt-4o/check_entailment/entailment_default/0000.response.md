The provided program takes two numbers as input and returns them in a tuple in a different order, specifically (b, a). The function itself operates simply and directly as described in the problem statement and the assertions support its stated behavior by validating specific input cases.

The output hints clarify that the function accepts both integers and floats as inputs and returns a tuple containing those values in reversed order. It also specifies that the function does not handle any specific edge cases like empty values, None, or non-numeric types, which is consistent with the assumption that valid input will be provided.

1. In the assertions provided, all valid cases of numeric types (integers) are handled correctly:
   - `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`.
   - `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`.
   - `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`.

The code does not need to account for edge cases like None or invalid types, as the problem states it is simply taking two numbers and returning them in a tuple, assuming that they will be valid.

Given this understanding, there are no identified instances where the function behaves incorrectly according to the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
