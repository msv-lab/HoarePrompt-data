Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Explanation:
1. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats.
2. It correctly returns a tuple in the order of `(b, a)`, which aligns with the requirement to return a tuple that has the second number first and then the first number.
3. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function produces the expected output for the given inputs:
   - `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is again correct.
   - `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, also correct.

The program does not handle any edge cases or validation since the problem description assumes valid numeric input. However, the correctness of the output is unaffected as it consistently forms the required tuple. Thus, the function correctly implements the specified output requirements for all valid numerical inputs as stated, justifying the conclusion that the program is correct.
