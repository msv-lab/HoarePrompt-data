Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description by correctly taking in two numbers and returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the code confirm the expected behavior of the function for the given inputs, matching the outputs specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the function's behavior and clarifies that it correctly returns a tuple `(b, a)`. Given that it is stated that valid inputs will be provided, and no errors will occur, the function is correctly defined per the requirements. Thus, the original assessment correctly identifies the program's correctness.
