You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, as stated in the problem description. Additionally, all provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified inputs. Since no edge cases or exceptions are described in the problem and the function seems to handle all potential cases correctly (such as negative numbers or zero), the implementation can be considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. It returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`, in that order. The function does not perform any additional validation or manipulation of the input parameters, meaning it behaves the same regardless of the types or values of `a` and `b`, including edge cases such as empty values, None, or non-numeric types. The final state of the program is that a tuple with the values `(b, a)` is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
