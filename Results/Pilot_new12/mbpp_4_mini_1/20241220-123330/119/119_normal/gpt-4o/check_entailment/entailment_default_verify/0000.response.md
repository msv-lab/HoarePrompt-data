Final: **False**

The original assessment identifies the program as correct based solely on the problem description and the assertions provided. However, the output hints clarify that the function does not perform any validation on the input parameters and will simply return a tuple `(b, a)` regardless of the types or values of `a` and `b`.

Given these hints, it becomes apparent that the function is not restricted to only handling numerics (integers or floats) as the problem description implies. It also does not handle cases of non-numeric inputs (like `None`, strings, or other types) that are potentially harmful. Therefore, while it may behave as expected in well-defined cases, the lack of input validation suggests it's not adequately robust to cover all scenarios, especially since the problem description does not explicitly clarify the types of inputs expected.

As a result, the original assessment of correctness is not aligned with the details provided in the output hints, indicating that the program could behave incorrectly with invalid inputs. Thus, the final assessment should be marked as incorrect.
