Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which specifies that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number.

Here's how the code works:

- The function `func_1` is defined to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`.
- Within the function, it returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the requirement of returning the second number first and then the first number.

The assertions provided in the program also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, maintaining correctness.

Since there are no edge cases or unexpected inputs that cause the function to behave incorrectly, the program fulfills the described requirements accurately for all potential input cases.
