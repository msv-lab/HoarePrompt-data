Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, as stated in the problem description. Additionally, all provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified inputs. Since no edge cases or exceptions are described in the problem and the function seems to handle all potential cases correctly (such as negative numbers or zero), the implementation can be considered correct.
