Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as arguments and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number, which aligns perfectly with the requirements given in the problem description. 

The annotated version confirms that at the point of function call, the inputs `a` and `b` are indeed numbers and are returned in the correct order as specified. All assertions provided confirm that the function behaves correctly for the specified inputs.

Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support this correctness, the conclusion is that the program is correctly implemented.
