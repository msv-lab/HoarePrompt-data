Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description effectively. The function `func_1` correctly takes two numbers and returns them as a tuple in the specified order: `(second number, first number)`. The annotated code indicates that the inputs are numbers, and the behavior of the function aligns perfectly with this expectation. The assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases, and no edge cases present any risk of failure given the assumption that valid inputs are always provided. Therefore, the overall functionality of the program is sound, supporting the conclusion that its correctness is indeed **True**.
