Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description clearly states that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The implementation of `func_1` achieves this by correctly returning `(b, a)`, where `b` is the second parameter and `a` is the first.

The annotated version of the code supports this correctness by verifying that before the function call, `a` and `b` are indeed numbers (either integers or floats). The return statement confirms that the values are returned in the correct order.

Additionally, the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, yielding the correct tuples for each test case. Since there are no edge cases or unexpected behaviors identified in the annotations that would affect the validity of the function under the assumption of valid inputs, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
