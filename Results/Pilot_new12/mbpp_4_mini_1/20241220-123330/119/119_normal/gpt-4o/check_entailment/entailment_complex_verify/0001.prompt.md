You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which specifies that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number.

Here's how the code works:

- The function `func_1` is defined to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`.
- Within the function, it returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the requirement of returning the second number first and then the first number.

The assertions provided in the program also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, maintaining correctness.

Since there are no edge cases or unexpected inputs that cause the function to behave incorrectly, the program fulfills the described requirements accurately for all potential input cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (can be integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, where b is a number and a is a number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. It returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`, in that order. The function does not perform any additional validation or manipulation of the input parameters, meaning it behaves the same regardless of the types or values of `a` and `b`, including edge cases such as empty values, None, or non-numeric types. The final state of the program is that a tuple with the values `(b, a)` is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
