Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple consisting of `b` followed by `a`, in that specific order. The assertions provided further confirm that the output meets the expected results.

The output hints do not present any case where the function fails. They confirm the function's behavior, stating that it does not perform additional validation or manipulation of the inputs and will return a tuple for any valid values of `a` and `b`, without raising errors. Given that input is assumed to be valid, the function behaves as specified in every reasonable scenario laid out by the problem description.

Overall, since there are no identified cases of failure and all provided examples work as intended, I conclude that the program is correct.
