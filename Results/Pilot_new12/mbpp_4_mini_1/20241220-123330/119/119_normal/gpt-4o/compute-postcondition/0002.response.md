Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be either integers or floats. It returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`, in that order. The function does not perform any additional validation or manipulation of the input parameters, meaning it behaves the same regardless of the types or values of `a` and `b`, including edge cases such as empty values, None, or non-numeric types. The final state of the program is that a tuple with the values `(b, a)` is returned.**
