To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the function implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{Area of base} \times \text{Length} \]

Where:
- The area of the triangular base is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \]

Consequently, the volume becomes:

\[ V = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \right) \times l \]

Where:
- \( b \) = base of the triangle
- \( h \) = height of the triangle
- \( l \) = length of the prism

### Function Implementation
Given the provided implementation of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

Letâ€™s break down the implementation:
- The function computes the volume by first calculating the area of the triangular base and then multiplying it by the length of the prism.
- Mainly, the formula used in the code is accurate:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \]

### Validating the Logic Against Potential Edge Cases
1. If any of the inputs \( b \), \( h \), or \( l \) is 0 or negative, the volume should logically be 0 or undefined, which the code handles correctly since multiplication by 0 will result in 0.
2. There are no scenarios in standard geometric interpretation where the negative dimensions would yield a valid volume.

### Conclusion
Since the function provides correct results aligned with the mathematical formula of the volume of a triangular prism under normal circumstances, and it handles edge cases (e.g., zero and negative values), we can conclude that the implementation meets the problem description.

Therefore, I find no cases where the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
