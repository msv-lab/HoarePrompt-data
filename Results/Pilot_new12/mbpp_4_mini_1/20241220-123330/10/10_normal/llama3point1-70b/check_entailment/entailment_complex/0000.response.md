Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to calculate the volume of a triangular prism given the base `b`, height `h`, and length `l`. 

The formula used in the function, `(b * h / 2) * l`, accurately represents the mathematical calculation for the volume of a triangular prism. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is computed using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{Area of triangular face} \times \text{Length of the prism}
   \]
   where the area of the triangular face is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{b \times h}{2}
   \]
   Hence, the overall volume is correctly calculated as:
   \[
   V = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
   \]

2. **Input Assumptions**: The problem states that `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers, and the program functions correctly under this assumption. Since we're assuming valid input as per the task description, the absence of validation for negative or zero inputs does not affect the correctness of the implementation. 

3. **Correct Function Definition**: The function accepts three parameters and performs the necessary calculation, returning the computed volume as expected.

Overall, given that all conditions of the problem description are met, we conclude that the program behaves as intended.
