Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism as per the problem description. The formula used in the function is \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \), where \( b \) is the base of the triangular face, \( h \) is the height of the triangular face, and \( l \) is the length of the prism. 

This calculation correctly computes the area of the triangular face using \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \) and then multiplies that area by the length \( l \). Since the function assumes the inputs are valid positive numbers, it meets the requirements as outlined in the problem description without any cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, it fulfills the requirements of the task efficiently and directly.
