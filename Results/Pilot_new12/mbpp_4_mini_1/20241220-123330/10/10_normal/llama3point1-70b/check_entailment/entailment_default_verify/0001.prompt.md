You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the function implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{Area of base} \times \text{Length} \]

Where:
- The area of the triangular base is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \]

Consequently, the volume becomes:

\[ V = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \right) \times l \]

Where:
- \( b \) = base of the triangle
- \( h \) = height of the triangle
- \( l \) = length of the prism

### Function Implementation
Given the provided implementation of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

Letâ€™s break down the implementation:
- The function computes the volume by first calculating the area of the triangular base and then multiplying it by the length of the prism.
- Mainly, the formula used in the code is accurate:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \]

### Validating the Logic Against Potential Edge Cases
1. If any of the inputs \( b \), \( h \), or \( l \) is 0 or negative, the volume should logically be 0 or undefined, which the code handles correctly since multiplication by 0 will result in 0.
2. There are no scenarios in standard geometric interpretation where the negative dimensions would yield a valid volume.

### Conclusion
Since the function provides correct results aligned with the mathematical formula of the volume of a triangular prism under normal circumstances, and it handles edge cases (e.g., zero and negative values), we can conclude that the implementation meets the problem description.

Therefore, I find no cases where the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters, `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. All three parameters are expected to be positive numbers. Upon execution, the function calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h \div 2) \times l\), which represents the area of the triangular face multiplied by the length of the prism. The function directly returns the computed volume. However, the function does not include any validation for the input values; it assumes that `b`, `h`, and `l` are strictly positive, meaning that it would not handle cases where any of these values are zero or negative. Additionally, there are no explicit checks or error handling for invalid types of input, which could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
