Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the volume of a prism, which is: 

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} \]

In this case, the base area of the triangular base is computed as \( \frac{b \times h}{2} \) where \( b \) is the base length and \( h \) is the height of the triangle. The length \( l \) is then multiplied to yield the final volume.

Since all calculations are correct and adhere to the problem statement without any edge cases improperly handled, the program is deemed correct.
