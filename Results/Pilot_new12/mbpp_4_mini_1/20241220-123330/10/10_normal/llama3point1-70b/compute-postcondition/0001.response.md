The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. Each parameter is a positive number, where `b` represents the base of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangular face, and `l` represents the length of the prism. After executing the function body, the program calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h \div 2) \times l\) and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive numbers representing the dimensions of a triangular prism and return its volume. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, all positive numbers, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as \((b \times h \div 2) \times l\).**
