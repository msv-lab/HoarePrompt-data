#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive number representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive number representing the height of the triangular face, and l is a positive number representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base 'b' multiplied by height 'h' divided by 2, then multiplied by length 'l')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. All three parameters are expected to be positive numbers. Upon execution, the function calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h \div 2) \times l\), which represents the area of the triangular face multiplied by the length of the prism. The function directly returns the computed volume. However, the function does not include any validation for the input values; it assumes that `b`, `h`, and `l` are strictly positive, meaning that it would not handle cases where any of these values are zero or negative. Additionally, there are no explicit checks or error handling for invalid types of input, which could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed.
