#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a positive number representing the area of the triangular base, height is a positive number representing the height of the triangle, and length is a positive number representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns volume which is equal to 0.5 * base * height * length, where base is a positive number representing the area of the triangular base, height is a positive number representing the height of the triangle, and length is a positive number representing the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, all of which are expected to be positive numbers. It calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula volume = 0.5 * base * height * length, where base represents the length of the triangular base, height represents the height of the triangle, and length represents the length of the prism. The function returns the calculated volume. However, the code does not handle cases where the input parameters may be zero or negative values, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if such values are passed in.
