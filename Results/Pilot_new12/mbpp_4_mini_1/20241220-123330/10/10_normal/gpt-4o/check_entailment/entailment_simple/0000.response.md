Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the volume of a triangular prism. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding of Volume Calculation**: The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula:

   \[
   V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
   \]

   where the base area for the triangular base is given by:

   \[
   \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
   \]

   Thus, combining both parts, the volume can be expressed as:

   \[
   V = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \right) \times \text{Length} = 0.5 \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \times \text{Length}
   \]

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` implements this formula as follows:

   - It takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`.
   - It calculates the area of the triangular base correctly using the formula \( 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - It then calculates the total volume by multiplying the base area by the prism's length, which matches the formula above.
   - Finally, it returns the calculated volume.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test specific cases of the function and confirm that it behaves as expected:
   - For inputs `(10, 8, 6)`, the expected output is \( 0.5 \times 10 \times 8 \times 6 = 240 \).
   - For inputs `(3, 2, 2)`, the expected output is \( 0.5 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 6 \).
   - For inputs `(1, 2, 1)`, the expected output is \( 0.5 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \).

Each of these assertions passes, which reinforces that the implementation meets the problem description's requirements.

Overall, the function is implemented correctly, fulfilling the requirements of calculating the volume of a triangular prism, and it has been adequately validated by the provided assertions.
