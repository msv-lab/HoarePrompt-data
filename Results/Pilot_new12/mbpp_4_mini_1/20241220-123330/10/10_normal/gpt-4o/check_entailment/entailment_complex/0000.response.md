Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to compute the volume of a triangular prism based on the given problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. According to the problem statement, these parameters represent the relevant dimensions needed to calculate the volume of a triangular prism.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The function calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, which aligns with the geometric principle for the area of a triangle. It then multiplies the area by `length` to obtain the volume of the prism, using the formula `volume = base_area * length`.

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided verify that the function is returning the expected volume for given inputs. Each assertion checks the function against known output, confirming that the computed volumes are correct for the sample inputs.

4. **Handling of Input Validity**: The problem description assumes that valid positive numbers will always be provided as inputs. The code does not explicitly handle cases of negative or zero values, but since it is assumed that only valid inputs will be provided, this is not a failing factor in this context.

Overall, the function behaves as expected, consistently producing the correct output for valid inputs, thereby fulfilling the requirements set out in the problem description.
