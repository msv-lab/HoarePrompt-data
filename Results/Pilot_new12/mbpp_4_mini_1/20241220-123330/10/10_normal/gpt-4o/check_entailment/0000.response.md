Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

where the base area of a triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

The provided assertions verify the function with different sets of inputs, and all assertions pass based on the calculations performed in the function:

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the volume calculates to \(0.5 \times 10 \times 8 \times 6 = 240\).
2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the volume calculates to \(0.5 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 6\).
3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the volume calculates to \(0.5 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 1\).

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as bases or heights of zero resulting in zero volumes. Since there are no failing cases or missing logic identified, the program is correct.
