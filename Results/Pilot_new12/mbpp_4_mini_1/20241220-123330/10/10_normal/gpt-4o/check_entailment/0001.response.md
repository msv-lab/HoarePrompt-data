Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case where any of the parameters (base, height, or length) are negative or zero. The function should return a valid volume, which cannot be negative, and a triangular prism cannot have negative dimensions or a height of zero. For example:

- If `func_1(-10, 8, 6)` is called, it would return a negative volume, which is incorrect.
- If `func_1(0, 8, 6)` is called, it would return a volume of zero, which in the context of a triangular prism does not make sense since dimensions should be positive.

Since the code does not account for these edge cases and can produce incorrect results for certain input values, the program is deemed incorrect.
