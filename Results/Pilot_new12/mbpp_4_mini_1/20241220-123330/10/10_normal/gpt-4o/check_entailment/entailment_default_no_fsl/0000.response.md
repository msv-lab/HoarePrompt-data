Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input parameters (base, height, and length) may be zero or negative values. Although the problem description expects positive numbers, the program's implementation lacks any validation to handle invalid inputs, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if such values are provided. For instance, if `func_1(0, 2, 3)` or `func_1(-1, 2, 3)` is called, the function would still calculate a volume but with incorrect logic, resulting in erroneous output. Thus, since the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem statement, it is considered incorrect.
