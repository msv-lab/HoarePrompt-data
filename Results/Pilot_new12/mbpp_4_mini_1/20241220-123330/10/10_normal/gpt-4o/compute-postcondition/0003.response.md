The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive numbers. After executing the function body, it calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `0.5 * base * height * length`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive numbers: `base`, `height`, and `length` and return the volume of the triangular prism based on these parameters.  

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length, all of which are positive numbers, and returns the volume of a triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
