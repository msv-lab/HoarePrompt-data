Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `month` in the range 1 to 12. It checks if this `month` represents a month with 31 days, returning `True` for months 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), and 12 (December). It returns `False` for months with fewer than 31 days (i.e., February, April, June, September, and November). However, the function does not handle invalid input such as negative values or numbers greater than 12, which may lead to unintended behavior if such inputs are provided. The final state of the program upon execution is that it will either confirm the presence of 31 days in the provided month or deny it, providing no error handling for out-of-bound inputs.**
