The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not handle invalid month numbers (i.e., numbers less than 1 or greater than 12). However, the annotated version explicitly states that the inputs provided to the function will be valid and in the range 1 to 12. Therefore, based on this assumption of valid input, the function will correctly identify which months have 31 days.

The function checks membership in the set of months with 31 days and returns the expected results for the valid input cases presented in the assertions. Thus, the original assessment does not align with the conditions provided in the annotated version, which assumes valid inputs will be given.

Given that the program meets the problem description under the assumption provided (valid input), and all test cases confirm the correct functionality of the program, I conclude:

Final: **True**
