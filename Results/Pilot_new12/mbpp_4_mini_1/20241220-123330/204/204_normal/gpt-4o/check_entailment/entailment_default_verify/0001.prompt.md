You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check if a given month number contains 31 days. While it correctly identifies the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), it fails to adequately handle edge cases such as providing an invalid input. Specifically, if a user inputs a month number outside the range of 1 to 12 (e.g., `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`), the function will return `False`, which is not correct according to the problem description. The correct behavior would be to either raise an exception or return a specific value indicating the input is invalid. Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `month` in the range 1 to 12. It checks if this `month` represents a month with 31 days, returning `True` for months 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), and 12 (December). It returns `False` for months with fewer than 31 days (i.e., February, April, June, September, and November). However, the function does not handle invalid input such as negative values or numbers greater than 12, which may lead to unintended behavior if such inputs are provided. The final state of the program upon execution is that it will either confirm the presence of 31 days in the provided month or deny it, providing no error handling for out-of-bound inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
