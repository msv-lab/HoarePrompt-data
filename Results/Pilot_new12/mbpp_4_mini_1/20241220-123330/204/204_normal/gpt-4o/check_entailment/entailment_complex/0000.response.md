Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number (1 through 12) corresponds to a month that has 31 days. 

Here’s why the function is correct:

1. **Valid Month Handling**: It checks for specific months—January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12)—which are precisely the months with 31 days. The program returns `True` for these months and `False` for all others (February, April, June, September, and November).

2. **Use of Set for Membership Testing**: The implementation leverages a set (`months_with_31_days`), which provides an efficient way to check membership. The statement `month in months_with_31_days` will return `True` if the month is one of those in the set, fulfilling the requirement effectively.

3. **Boundary Cases**: The function properly addresses the boundaries of the valid month numbers since it only exists in the range of 1 to 12 as specified by the problem. 

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem description assumes valid input without the need for error handling for out-of-bound values. Accordingly, the program does not fail or behave unexpectedly when valid inputs are provided.

Thus, based on the functionality and the assumptions noted, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
