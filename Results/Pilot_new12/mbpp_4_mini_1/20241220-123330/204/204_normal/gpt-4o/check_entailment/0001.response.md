Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check if a given month number contains 31 days. While it correctly identifies the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), it fails to adequately handle edge cases such as providing an invalid input. Specifically, if a user inputs a month number outside the range of 1 to 12 (e.g., `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)`), the function will return `False`, which is not correct according to the problem description. The correct behavior would be to either raise an exception or return a specific value indicating the input is invalid. Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
