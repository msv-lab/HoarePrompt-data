Final: **True**

The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number corresponds to months that have 31 days. The assertions provided also show that the function behaves as expected for the valid input range of 1 to 12, returning `True` for January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, and returning `False` for all other months. 

While the original assessment highlighted concerns about handling invalid input (e.g., numbers outside the range of 1 to 12), the provided annotations state that we assume valid input will be given, which is crucial for judging the function's correctness per the problem description. Given that the function successfully meets the requirements under the assumption of valid input, it is appropriate to conclude that the function is correct for the specified task.

Therefore, overall, the function does meet the problem's requirement given the specified conditions. The previous assessment's focus on potential invalid inputs is not applicable here since we are told to assume valid inputs will always be provided, contributing to a determination of correctness. Thus, the final assessment is **True**.
