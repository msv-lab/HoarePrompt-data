Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly determines whether a given month has 31 days. The function uses a set to check for months with 31 days, but does not handle invalid month numbers (i.e., numbers less than 1 or greater than 12). For example, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would not raise an error but would incorrectly return `False`, which is not valid behavior as those are not valid month numbers. Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases specified in the problem description.
