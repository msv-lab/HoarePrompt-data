Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to account for the month of February (month number 2), which does not have 31 days. In the test cases provided, `func_1(2)` is asserted to return `False`, which is correct. However, the assertions for the months that do not contain 31 days (specifically months 4, 6, 9, and 11) are not included in the assertions, meaning there is no test to ensure that the function correctly identifies them. 

Months with 31 days are accurately represented, but the logic does not explicitly rule out all months without 31 days, and there are missing assertions for those months. Thus, it cannot be assured that the function handles all cases as the problem description outlinesâ€”the lack of assertions for February and the months with fewer than 31 days lead to uncertainty.

Therefore, while the provided function has some correct logic, it does not demonstrate correctness for all cases as specified in the problem description.
