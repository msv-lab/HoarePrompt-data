Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle invalid input cases such as negative values or numbers greater than 12, which are outside the range of valid months (1 to 12). According to the output hints, if an invalid month number is provided (e.g., -1, 0, or 13), the function would behave unexpectedly as it does not include error handling for these potential cases. Therefore, since the program does not meet the problem description requirements for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
