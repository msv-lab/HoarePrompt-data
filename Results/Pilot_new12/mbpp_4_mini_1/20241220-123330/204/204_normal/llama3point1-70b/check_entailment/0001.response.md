Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, it checks if a given month number (represented by `n`) contains 31 days. However, it does not account for invalid month numbers.

For example:
- If the input `n` is `0`, `13`, or any number outside the range `1-12`, the program will incorrectly return `False`, even though the month number itself is invalid.
- The input `n = 2` (February) would also incorrectly return `False`, despite February having only 28 or 29 days (not 31).

Thus, since the program does not handle invalid month numbers and provides incorrect results for them, it fails to meet the specifications of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
