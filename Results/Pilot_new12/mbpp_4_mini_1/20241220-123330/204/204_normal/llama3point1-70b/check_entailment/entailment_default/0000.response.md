Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` checks if the month number `n` is in the list of months that contain 31 days. While the function works correctly for valid month numbers in the range 1 to 12, it does not handle cases where the month number is outside of this range (for example, negative numbers or numbers greater than 12). In those cases, the function will still return `False` without any feedback or indication that the input was invalid. Thus, the function does not fulfill the problem description completely, as it does not consider all potential input cases.
