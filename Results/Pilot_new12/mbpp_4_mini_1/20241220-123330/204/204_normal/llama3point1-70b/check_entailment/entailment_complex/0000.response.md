Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` representing the month number (where 1 corresponds to January and 12 corresponds to December). The function checks if the provided month number is one of the months that have 31 days by looking it up in the predefined list `months_31_days`, which includes the correct months: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The function returns `True` if `n` is in that list, indicating that the month has 31 days. If `n` is not in the list, it returns `False`, indicating that the month does not have 31 days. 

As per the assumptions stated, the input is always valid within the range of 1 to 12. Therefore, the function always behaves as required by the problem description, accurately identifying whether the given month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days.
