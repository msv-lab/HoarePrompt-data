Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` checks if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days. However, it does not handle cases where the input is outside the valid month range (1 to 12). For example, if the input is 0 or 13, the program will incorrectly return `False`, although this behavior is not specified in the problem description. 

Moreover, if an invalid month number is passed, the function provides no feedback or error indication, which is also outside the expectations of the problem description. Therefore, since it does not handle all potential cases correctly, the program is considered incorrect.
