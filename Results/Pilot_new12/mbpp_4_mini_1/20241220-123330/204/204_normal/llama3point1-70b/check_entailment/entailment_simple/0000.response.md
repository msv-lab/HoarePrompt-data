Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It checks whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Validity**: The function is designed to receive an integer `n` that represents a month number. The problem description specifies that `1 <= n <= 12`, and the program accurately assumes valid input for this range.

2. **Months with 31 Days**: The function defines a list `months_31_days` which contains the month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. This list is comprehensive for the months that indeed have 31 days.

3. **Membership Test**: The function checks if the input month number `n` is present in the `months_31_days` list using the expression `n in months_31_days`. This leverages a straightforward and efficient membership test to determine if the month has 31 days.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if `n` is in the list (indicating that the month has 31 days), and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to check the number of days in a month.

Since the program fulfills the criteria laid out in the problem description for every valid input, it is determined to be correct.
