Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether a given month number (1 for January, 2 for February, ... , 12 for December) contains 31 days. It uses a list to store the month numbers that have 31 days and checks if the provided month number is in that list. 

It's important to note that:
- Months 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), and 12 (December) do have 31 days.
- The program returns `False` for months that do not have 31 days (2 for February and 4, 6, 9, 11 for the months that have less than 31 days).

All potential cases appear to be handled correctly, thus confirming the correctness of the program.
