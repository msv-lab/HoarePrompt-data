Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description and accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days. The annotated version confirms that the input, `n`, is always a valid integer between 1 and 12, aligning with the expectations of the function. The list `months_31_days` correctly includes all the months with 31 days. Therefore, the program functions as intended, returning `True` for valid months with 31 days and `False` for the others, which is consistent with the problem statement. The program handles all specified cases without any oversight.
