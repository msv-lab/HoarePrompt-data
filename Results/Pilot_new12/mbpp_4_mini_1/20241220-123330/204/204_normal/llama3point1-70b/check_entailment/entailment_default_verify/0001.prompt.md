You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, it checks if a given month number (represented by `n`) contains 31 days. However, it does not account for invalid month numbers.

For example:
- If the input `n` is `0`, `13`, or any number outside the range `1-12`, the program will incorrectly return `False`, even though the month number itself is invalid.
- The input `n = 2` (February) would also incorrectly return `False`, despite February having only 28 or 29 days (not 31).

Thus, since the program does not handle invalid month numbers and provides incorrect results for them, it fails to meet the specifications of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n`, which represents a month number between 1 and 12. It checks whether `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days by determining if `n` is in a predefined list of months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function returns True if `n` is in that list, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the month does not have 31 days. The function does not handle cases outside the valid range of month numbers (1 to 12) or provide error feedback for such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
