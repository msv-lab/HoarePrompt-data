#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the month number, such that 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if n (month number) is in the list months_31_days which includes the months that have 31 days, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n`, which represents a month number between 1 and 12. It checks whether `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days by determining if `n` is in a predefined list of months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function returns True if `n` is in that list, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the month does not have 31 days. The function does not handle cases outside the valid range of month numbers (1 to 12) or provide error feedback for such cases.
