The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which states that it should calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Implementation**: The function `func_1(n)` computes \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which does not relate to the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficients \( C(n, k) \) represent the coefficients in the expansion of \( (x + y)^n \), and the even indices refer to \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), \ldots \), which cannot be represented simply by \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

2. **Example Assertions**: The assertions do not relate to the sum of even index binomial coefficients either. For example, for \( n=4 \), the even indexed coefficients would be \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \), which does not match the asserted value of 8. Hence, the provided assertions are misleading and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
