Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The problem description specifies that the function should compute the sum of even-index binomial coefficients. However, the implementation simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not align with the expected behavior: summing specific binomial coefficients. Furthermore, the output hints acknowledge this issue by discussing the return value rather than relating it to the sum of even-index binomial coefficients. Thus, the code does not meet the criteria established in the problem description. For example, for `n = 4`, the correct sum of the even-index binomial coefficients (which are `C(4,0)`, `C(4,2)`, and `C(4,4)`, equaling `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`) does not match the way `2 ** (n - 1)` has been used here. This directly indicates a failure in the implementation, confirming that the code is incorrect.
