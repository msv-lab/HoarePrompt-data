Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer n. Instead, the program computes `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not reflect the required calculation of binomial coefficients in any way.

For instance, when `n=4`, the correct sum of the even index binomial coefficients (from the expansion of `(1 + 1)^4`, which corresponds to the coefficients `1, 4, 6, 4, 1`) should be `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`. The function seems to produce the right result for this specific case, but it does not follow the intended logic of summing the binomial coefficients at even indices.

Additionally, the implementation offers no flexibility for handling a range of cases related to the sums of binomial coefficients, as it is essentially just returning powers of 2. It therefore fails to meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
