Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately pointed out that the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients based on the problem description. The annotated version reiterates that the function returns \(2^{(n-1)}\) instead of calculating the even indexed binomial coefficients, confirming the assessment.

In conclusion, the reasoning behind the original assessment holds true: the calculations performed by `func_1` do not align with the expected results based on the properties of binomial coefficients for the provided values of \(n\). The annotations do not change this understanding; they merely clarify how the function operates.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
