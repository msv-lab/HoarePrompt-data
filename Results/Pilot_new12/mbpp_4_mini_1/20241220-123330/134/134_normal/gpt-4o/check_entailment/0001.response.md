To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the implementation of the function.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

### Program Analysis:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

The function `func_1` returns `2 ** (n - 1)` for any input `n`. The assertions check whether this output matches expected values for specific inputs.

### Understanding the Output:
- The binomial coefficient for a certain `n` can be computed using `math.comb(n, k)` where `k` is the index.
- "Even index binomial coefficients" means summing the values of `C(n, 0)`, `C(n, 2)`, `C(n, 4)`, etc., up to the maximum allowable index within `n`.

### Expected Outputs for the Given Inputs:
1. For `n = 4`, the binomial coefficients are:
   - C(4, 0) = 1
   - C(4, 1) = 4
   - C(4, 2) = 6
   - C(4, 3) = 4
   - C(4, 4) = 1
   - Sum of even indexed coefficients: **1 (C(4,0)) + 6 (C(4,2)) + 1 (C(4,4)) = 8** (This is correct for `n=4`).

2. For `n = 6`, the coefficients are:
   - Sum of even indexed coefficients: **1 (C(6,0)) + 15 (C(6,2)) + 20 (C(6,4)) + 1 (C(6,6)) = 37** (But the assertion is expecting 32, which is incorrect).

3. For `n = 2`, the coefficients are:
   - Sum of even indexed coefficients: **1 (C(2,0)) + 1 (C(2,2)) = 2** (This is correct for `n=2`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the sum of even index binomial coefficients for `n=6`, as the expected sum is not producing the correct result. Because there is a failure on at least one input case, the program does not meet the problem specification.

Correctness: **False**
