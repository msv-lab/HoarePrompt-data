To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze whether it accurately computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \).

The program includes an assertion for various values of \( n \) which implies an expected output calculated using the function `func_1`. However, I need to verify the correctness of the logic implemented in the function.

The function implemented is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Function

1. **Understanding Binomial Coefficients**: 
   - The binomial coefficients are typically represented as \( C(n, k) \), with \( C(n, k) \) being the coefficient of \( x^k \) in the expansion of \( (1 + x)^n \).
   - The even index coefficients would be those for \( k = 0, 2, 4, \ldots \) (depending on \( n \)).

2. **Computing the Sum of Even Index Binomial Coefficients**:
   - The coefficients can be computed using the formula:
     - For even indices, we have \( C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots \)
   - The sum of even index coefficients can also be derived from the identity:
     - The total sum of coefficients, \( (1 + 1)^n = 2^n \).
     - The alternating sum \( (1 - 1)^n = 0 \) for all \( n > 0 \).
   - Using these properties, the sum of coefficients at even indices equals half of the total sum, which can be expressed as \( 2^{n-1} \).

### Test Cases Provided

- The assertions in the program are:
  - `func_1(4) == 8`
  - `func_1(6) == 32`
  - `func_1(2) == 2`

Each of these holds true based on the function logic because:
- For \( n = 4 \):
  - The even indexed binomial coefficients are \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \) (this appears to be incorrect)
- For \( n = 6 \):
  - The sum \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \) (not matching)
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The sum \( C(2, 0) = 1 \) (this is not matching)

### Conclusion

The function does not correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for inputs, and the assertions provided do not yield their expected results based on the function's logic. It appears that the logic should directly compute binomial coefficients, rather than just returning \( 2^{n-1} \).

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the requirements of the problem description accurately, particularly in calculating the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.
