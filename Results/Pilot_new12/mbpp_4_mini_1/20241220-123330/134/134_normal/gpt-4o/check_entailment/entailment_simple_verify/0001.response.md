Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The annotated code confirms that the function is simply returning `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is not aligned with the task of calculating the sum of even indexed binomial coefficients, particularly failing for `n = 6` as demonstrated in the analysis. Thus the program is incorrect and does not perform as intended.
