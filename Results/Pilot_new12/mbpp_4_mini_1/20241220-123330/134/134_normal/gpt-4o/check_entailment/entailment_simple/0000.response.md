Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). However, the function `func_1` merely returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \), which is not related to binomial coefficients or their summation.

Binomial coefficients at even indices correspond to coefficients from the binomial expansion, and the function should compute the sum of those values rather than computing a power of 2. For example, for \( n = 4 \), the even indexed binomial coefficients of \( (x + y)^4 \) are \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) + C(4, 4) \), which equals \( 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \). Although the program returns 8 for this case, it does so incorrectly, as it never actually calculates the binomial coefficients.

Thus, the implementation fails to address the requirements of the problem as described.
