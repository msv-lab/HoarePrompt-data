Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer, and it returns the value of `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`. After the function concludes, if `n` is 1 (the smallest positive integer), it will return `1`, since \(2^{(1 - 1)} = 2^0 = 1\). If `n` is greater than 1, it will return powers of 2 corresponding to the input value, effectively yielding integers in the sequence of powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. It does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer (e.g., `n` is 0 or negative), and the function's correctness relies on the assumption that the input is indeed a positive integer.**
