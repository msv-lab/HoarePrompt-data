In the provided code snippet, `sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to its current value. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is initialized to 1, we can compute the value of `math.comb(n, 1)` which equals `n`, since the combination of `n` items taken 1 at a time is simply `n`. 

The initial value of `sum` is 1, so after executing the line `sum += math.comb(n, i)`, the new value of `sum` will be updated to `1 + n`.

The variable `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `sum` and retain the characteristics of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
