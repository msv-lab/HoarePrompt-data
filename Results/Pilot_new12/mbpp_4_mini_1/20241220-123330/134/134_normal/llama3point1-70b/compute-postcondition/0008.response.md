According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` (since the range goes up to `n + 1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, since `i` is 2 after this next increment, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is equal to 1 if `i` is odd (which will be false since `i` becomes 2), and for the next iteration, `i` will be 2.**
