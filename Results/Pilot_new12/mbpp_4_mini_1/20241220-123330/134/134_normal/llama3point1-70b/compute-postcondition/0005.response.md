According to the code, the loop iterates over `range(n + 1)`, which means it will execute from `i = 0` to `i = n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `sum` is 1. Since the loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to check the next value for `i`. 

The next value for `i` will be 1 (i.e., `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and `n` is still a positive integer, meaning it must be at least 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
