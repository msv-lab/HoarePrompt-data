`sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)`, which calculates the number of combinations of `n` taken `i` at a time. Since `i` is currently 0, `math.comb(n, 0)` equals 1 for any positive integer `n`. Therefore, `sum` is now equal to 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0, and `i` is currently an even integer as `i` mod 2 equals 0.**
