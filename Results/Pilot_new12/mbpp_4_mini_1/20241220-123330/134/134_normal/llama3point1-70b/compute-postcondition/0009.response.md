In the provided code snippet, `sum` is incremented by the value of `math.comb(n, i)`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2 based on the initial conditions. The function `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time.

1. The initial state of `sum` is either 1 or the result of the previous calculations involving `i`, but since `i` was odd at the previous point and now `i` becomes 2, we consider `sum` as starting from this initial state.

2. The calculation `math.comb(n, i)` where `i = 2`, evaluates to `n * (n - 1) / 2` due to the combinatorial formula, since we are selecting 2 items from `n`. 

3. The overall update of `sum` is done by adding the result from `math.comb(n, 2)` to the existing value of `sum`.

Thus, the output state combines the updated value of `sum` and retains all applicable conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 2; `sum` is equal to 1 plus the value of `math.comb(n, 2)` which is equal to 1 + (n * (n - 1) / 2)**
