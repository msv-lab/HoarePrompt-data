The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function calculates and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` from 0 to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the sum of the combinations of `n` taken `i` at a time for all even values of `i` from 0 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, inclusive.**
