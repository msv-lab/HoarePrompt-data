According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is greater than or equal to 1. The `for` loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, inclusive. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will first be 0 as the loop starts iterating. The state of `sum` doesn't affect the ability of the loop to execute but can change in the loop's body.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` starts at 0.

So the adjusted state for the loop execution would be: 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
