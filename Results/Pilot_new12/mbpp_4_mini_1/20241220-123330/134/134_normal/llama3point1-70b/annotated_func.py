#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`, inclusive.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` ranging from `0` to `n`, inclusive. It returns this sum as an integer. If `n` is negative or non-integer, the function does not handle these cases explicitly but assumes that the input will always be a valid positive integer as per the function's context and preconditions.
