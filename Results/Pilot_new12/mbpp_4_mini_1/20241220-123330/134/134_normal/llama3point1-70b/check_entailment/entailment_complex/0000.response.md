Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`, inclusive. 

Here's a breakdown of how the implementation aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Suitability**: The function accepts a positive integer `n`. The problem description specifies the input will always be a positive integer, so the program does not need to handle invalid input cases. 

2. **Looping Through Indices**: The function uses a for loop that iterates over the range of `n + 1`. This correctly covers all integers from `0` to `n`, ensuring all potential even indices are evaluated.

3. **Checking for Even Indices**: Inside the for loop, there is a condition `if i % 2 == 0:` which checks if the current index `i` is even. This ensures that the sum only includes coefficients at even indices.

4. **Summation of Binomial Coefficients**: The summation uses `math.comb(n, i)` for the valid even indices. The binomial coefficient function `math.comb(n, i)` computes the number of ways to choose `i` elements from a total of `n`, which aligns with the usage for obtaining binomial coefficients.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the computed sum, which, as stated in the annotations, represents the sum of the specified binomial coefficients for all valid even indices.

Given that the function accomplishes exactly what is required by the problem description, it is deemed to be correct and fulfills the specified task under the provided assumptions. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
