Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by defining a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single input parameter `n`, which is specified to be a positive integer. The program correctly assumes that the input will adhere to this requirement.

2. **Sum of Even Indexed Binomial Coefficients**: The program uses a loop that iterates from `0` to `n`, checking if the index `i` is even (using the condition `i % 2 == 0`). For each even index, it computes the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and accumulates it into the variable `sum`.

3. **Correct Range of Indices**: The loop iterates through all indices from `0` to `n`, thus covering all possible even indices up to `n`.

4. **Return Value**: After the loop completes, the function returns the accumulated sum, which aligns with the requirement of finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, producing the correct output by adding only the binomial coefficients that have even indices.
