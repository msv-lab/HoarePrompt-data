The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients as described in the problem description. The logic within the function iterates from `0` to `n` and sums the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` only for even indices `i`. 

The output hints confirm that the function handles even indices from `0` to `n`, and it does indeed return the sum of these coefficients correctly. The problem description specifies that the function takes in a positive integer `n`, and the hints also indicate that negative values or non-integers are not handled, but it assumes valid input as per the function's context, which aligns with the instruction.

Testing the function for a variety of `n` values, such as `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 3`, reveals that:
- For `n = 0`, the sum is `math.comb(0, 0) = 1`.
- For `n = 1`, the sum is `math.comb(1, 0) = 1`.
- For `n = 2`, the sum is `math.comb(2, 0) + math.comb(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- For `n = 3`, the sum is `math.comb(3, 0) + math.comb(3, 2) = 1 + 3 = 4`.

All results are as expected based on the calculations for even indices.

In conclusion, the implementation aligns perfectly with the requirements laid out in the problem description, and there are no edge cases or scenarios where it fails to work as intended, assuming valid input. 

Correctness: **True**.
