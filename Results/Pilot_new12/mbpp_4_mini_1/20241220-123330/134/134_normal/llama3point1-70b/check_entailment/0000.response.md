Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. 

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding of Binomial Coefficients**: The function `math.comb(n, i)` computes the binomial coefficient `C(n, i)`, which gives the number of ways to choose i elements from a set of n elements. The even indexed coefficients correspond to taking values of i that are even (0, 2, 4, etc.).

2. **Looping through indices**: The loop iterates from `0` to `n`, and for each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even using `i % 2 == 0`. If it is, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the total sum.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When `n` is `0`, the only coefficient is `C(0,0)`, which is `1` (even index), and the output will be correct.
   - For other positive integers, it correctly sums only those coefficients at even indices, making it reliable for any positive input.

Since all tested cases and the logic appear to be correctly addressed, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
