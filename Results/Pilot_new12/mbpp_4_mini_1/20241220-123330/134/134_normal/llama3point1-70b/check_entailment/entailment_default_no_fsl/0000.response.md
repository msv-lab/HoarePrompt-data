Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices, which range from `0` to `n`. The loop iterates through all integers from `0` to `n`, checking if each index `i` is even and adding the corresponding binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the total sum when it is.

Since the problem description specifies that the function should work with positive integers and assumes the input is always valid, the program does not need to handle negative or non-integer inputs. Under these assumptions, the implementation will produce the correct output for all valid positive integer inputs. 

As a result, the program functions as intended for all appropriate inputs, leading to the conclusion of correctness.
