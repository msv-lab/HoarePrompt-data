The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` ranging from `0` to `n`, inclusive. It returns this sum as an integer. If `n` is negative or non-integer, the function does not handle these cases explicitly but assumes that the input will always be a valid positive integer as per the function's context and preconditions.
