The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of a rectangle. After executing the function body, the program returns the area of the rectangle, calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative integers or floats for the dimensions of a rectangle and return the area calculated as the multiplication of these dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
