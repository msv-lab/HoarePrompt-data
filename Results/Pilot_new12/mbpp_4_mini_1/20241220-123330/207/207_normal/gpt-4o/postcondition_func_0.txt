The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle as the product of `length` and `width`. The function does not handle any edge cases related to negative or non-numeric inputs, and it assumes that the inputs adhere to the stated constraints of being non-negative integers or floats. If given valid inputs, it will successfully return their product; however, invalid inputs may lead to unintended behavior.
