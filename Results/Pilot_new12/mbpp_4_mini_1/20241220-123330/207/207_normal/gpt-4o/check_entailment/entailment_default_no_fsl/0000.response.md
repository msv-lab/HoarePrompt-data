Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge cases related to negative or non-numeric inputs. Although the function correctly calculates the area for valid non-negative integer or float inputs, the output hints clearly state that the function does not account for these important edge cases. For example, if the inputs were negative (e.g., `func_1(-10, 5)`), the function would incorrectly return a negative area, which is not valid in the context of calculating the area of a rectangle. Thus, since the program fails for at least one potential case (negative inputs), it cannot be deemed correct.
