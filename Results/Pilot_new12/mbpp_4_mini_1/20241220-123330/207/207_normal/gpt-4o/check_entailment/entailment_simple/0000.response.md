Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two inputs, `length` and `width`, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying these two inputs, which is the precise definition of the area of a rectangle.

The assertions provided test the function with various valid inputs, and in all cases, the function returns the expected area:
- For a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20, the area correctly computes to 200.
- For a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 5, it computes to 50.
- For a rectangle with a length of 4 and a width of 2, it computes to 8.

Since the input constraints specify that the inputs will always be non-negative integers or floats, the function will always perform correctly without encountering errors, and it adheres to the problem requirement of calculating the rectangle's area.

Hence, the program meets the specifications of the problem description accurately.
