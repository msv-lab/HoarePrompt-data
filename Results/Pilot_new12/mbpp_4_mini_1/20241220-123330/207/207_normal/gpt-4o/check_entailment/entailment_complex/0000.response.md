Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description by defining a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle based on the given `length` and `width`. The function performs the operation of multiplying the two parameters, which is indeed how the area of a rectangle is calculated (Area = Length * Width).

The assertions provided before the function definition serve as verification of its correctness, confirming that for the given inputs, the outputs match the expected areas:

1. `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the correct area for a rectangle with length `10` and width `20`.
2. `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, matching the area for length `10` and width `5`.
3. `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, consistent with the area for dimensions `4` and `2`.

Additionally, the function adheres to the required constraints mentioned in the annotations, assuming the input values are valid non-negative integers or floats. The function does not include any checks for invalid input, which aligns with the assumption that inputs will always be valid.

As such, the program meets the expectations set forth by the problem description and correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for the valid inputs considered.
