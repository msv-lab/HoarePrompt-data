Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle based on the given length and width parameters. The assertions provided test various valid cases for rectangles of different dimensions, and they all return the correct area as expected (length * width). Additionally, there are no edge cases related to input handling or invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description, which focuses solely on calculating the area.

Since the function handles the intended input types (integers or floats for length and width) and performs the correct calculation, I can't identify any potential case where it would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the program works as intended and meets the problem's requirements for calculating the area of a rectangle.
