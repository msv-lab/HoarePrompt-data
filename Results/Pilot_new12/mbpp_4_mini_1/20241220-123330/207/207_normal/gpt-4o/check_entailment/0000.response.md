Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the area of a rectangle. The function `func_1(length, width)` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. The provided assertions test the function with various inputs:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is correct.
- `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is correct.
- `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which is correct.

The implementation meets the problem description requirements, as it correctly computes the area for positive integer values. It will return correct results for any valid inputs where length and width are non-negative numbers. There are no missing cases or edge cases that cause it to behave incorrectly.
