The provided function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters. According to the problem description, it is asserted that the outputs for specific inputs are correct. 

Output hints indicate that the function expects `length` and `width` to be non-negative integers or floats. However, it does not handle cases where invalid input might be provided (such as negative numbers, zero, or non-numeric types). The function's output aligns with the basic calculation of area; it will return the product of the two parameters as specified.

Given that the problem description does not indicate how to handle cases of non-numeric or negative inputs, or zeros (as the area of a rectangle with dimensions of zero would intuitively be zero, but isn't explicitly addressed in the hints), we can assume for this evaluation that proper input is provided according to the specifications.

Since we do not have any specific cases outlined in the output hints or the problem description that show incorrect behavior for valid inputs, it appears that the function would return the correct area for the duly asserted test cases.

Correctness: **True**.
