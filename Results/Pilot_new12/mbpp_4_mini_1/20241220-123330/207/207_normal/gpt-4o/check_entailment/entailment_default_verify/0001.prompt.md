You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200
assert func_1(10, 5) == 50
assert func_1(4, 2) == 8

def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle based on the given length and width parameters. The assertions provided test various valid cases for rectangles of different dimensions, and they all return the correct area as expected (length * width). Additionally, there are no edge cases related to input handling or invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description, which focuses solely on calculating the area.

Since the function handles the intended input types (integers or floats for length and width) and performs the correct calculation, I can't identify any potential case where it would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the program works as intended and meets the problem's requirements for calculating the area of a rectangle.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle as the product of `length` and `width`. The function does not handle any edge cases related to negative or non-numeric inputs, and it assumes that the inputs adhere to the stated constraints of being non-negative integers or floats. If given valid inputs, it will successfully return their product; however, invalid inputs may lead to unintended behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
