#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are positive integers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as the product of length and width, both of which are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle as the product of `length` and `width`. However, the function does not validate that the inputs are indeed positive integers, which could lead to incorrect results or errors if negative or non-integer values are provided. After execution, the program state includes the computed area of the rectangle but does not handle or indicate any input errors.
