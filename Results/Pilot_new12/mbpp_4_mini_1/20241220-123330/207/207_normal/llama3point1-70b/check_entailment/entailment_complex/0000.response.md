Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The program's function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be positive integers representing the dimensions of the rectangle. It returns the product of these two parameters, effectively computing the area of the rectangle. 

Since the correctness assessment assumes that valid inputs (positive integers) will always be provided, the lack of input validation does not detract from the program's adherence to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program meets the expectations set forth in the problem description and delivers the correct output when valid inputs are supplied.
