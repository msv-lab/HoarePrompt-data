Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description by defining a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. 

- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`, which are stated to be positive integers. 
- The return statement in the function computes the area by multiplying these two parameters (`length * width`).
- The product of the length and width gives the correct area of a rectangle, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Since the function performs the calculation as specified and there is an assumption that valid inputs (positive integers) will be provided, the program meets the outlined requirements. Thus, the program fulfills the task of finding the area of a rectangle as given in the problem description.
