Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(length, width)` accurately calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \). 

This implementation adheres to the problem description and will correctly compute the area for any non-negative numerical inputs for length and width. It also implicitly handles edge cases such as zero values for length or width, since the area of a rectangle with zero dimensions is defined to be zero.

Therefore, there are no identifiable inputs or cases where the function does not work as described, confirming the accuracy of the implementation across all relevant scenarios.
