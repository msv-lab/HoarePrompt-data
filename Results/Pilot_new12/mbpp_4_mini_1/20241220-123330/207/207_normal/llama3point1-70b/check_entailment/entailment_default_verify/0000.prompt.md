You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula area = length * width. It will yield the correct area for both positive and negative values, as well as zero. The potential cases include:

1. Both length and width are positive.
2. One of them is negative (which will still mathematically give an area value).
3. Either length or width is zero (the area will be zero).

Since the function performs the multiplication correctly and no invalid inputs were specified that wouldn't make sense (like negative dimensions in the context of areas), the code adheres perfectly to the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle as the product of `length` and `width`. However, the function does not validate that the inputs are indeed positive integers, which could lead to incorrect results or errors if negative or non-integer values are provided. After execution, the program state includes the computed area of the rectangle but does not handle or indicate any input errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
