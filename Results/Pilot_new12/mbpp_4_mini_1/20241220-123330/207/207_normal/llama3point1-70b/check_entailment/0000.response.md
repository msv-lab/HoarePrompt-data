Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula area = length * width. It will yield the correct area for both positive and negative values, as well as zero. The potential cases include:

1. Both length and width are positive.
2. One of them is negative (which will still mathematically give an area value).
3. Either length or width is zero (the area will be zero).

Since the function performs the multiplication correctly and no invalid inputs were specified that wouldn't make sense (like negative dimensions in the context of areas), the code adheres perfectly to the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it is correct.
