The function accepts a parameter `input_list`, which can be a list of any data type, and returns a tuple that contains all elements from `input_list`. If `input_list` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle or process any potential issues related to the contents of `input_list`, such as nested lists or data types that may not be easily convertible into a tuple, but it will still successfully convert the provided input list into a tuple regardless of the data types contained within.
