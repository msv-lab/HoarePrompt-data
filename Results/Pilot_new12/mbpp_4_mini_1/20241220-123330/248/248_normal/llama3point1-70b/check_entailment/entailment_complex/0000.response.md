Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a list (`input_list`) and utilizes the `tuple()` constructor to convert the list into a tuple. 

Here is a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Type**: The function is expected to take a list of any data type. The program adheres to this requirement, as it will process the input `input_list`, which we assume to be a valid list based on the assumptions specified.

2. **Output Type**: The function correctly returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. This is exactly what the problem statement asks for.

3. **Handling Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, the `tuple()` constructor will return an empty tuple, which aligns with the expected behavior specified in the annotations.

4. **Flexibility with Data Types**: The function does not impose restrictions on the data types of the elements in the list; thus, it will successfully convert lists containing any data types (including nested lists) to tuples as per the problem description.

Since the function behaves in accordance with the problem description and handles the provided assumptions effectively, it is correct.

In summary, as all conditions of the problem statement are satisfied, the program is correctly implemented to accomplish its intended task.
