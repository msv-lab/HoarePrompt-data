Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements as the input list. 

To verify that it meets the requirements, consider the following cases:

1. An empty list `[]` should convert to an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list with a single element, e.g., `[1]`, should convert to a tuple with that single element `(1,)`.
3. A list with multiple elements, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, should correctly convert to `(1, 2, 3)`.
4. A list with different data types, e.g., `[1, "two", 3.0]`, should convert correctly to `(1, "two", 3.0)`.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, there are no identified edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail. 

Thus, the program is correct.
