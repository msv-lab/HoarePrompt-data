Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input parameter `input_list`, which is assumed to be a list of any data type. The program then converts this list into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and returns it.

Hereâ€™s why it always does what is specified in the problem description:
1. The function correctly transforms a list into a tuple without any additional modifications or data type checks, adhering to the problem's requirement of directly converting a list to a tuple.
2. The return statement provides the expected output as a tuple, which aligns perfectly with the task described.

Since the assumptions state that valid input will always be supplied, we do not need to worry about handling cases of invalid input, making this implementation correct for the specified problem.
