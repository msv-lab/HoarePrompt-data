Final: **True**

The original assessment declaring the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement of converting a list to a tuple. The evaluation of its functionality is consistent with the output hints provided, which outline that:

1. The function accepts any list and returns a tuple containing all its elements.
2. An empty input list results in an empty tuple, as expected.
3. The function's behavior for different data types, including integers, strings, and floats, is also correctly stated in the output hints.

The output hints clarify that the function does not handle nested lists or potential data type conversion issues, but since valid input is assumed, this does not affect the correctness of the function for the defined scope. The implementation performs as intended, providing the correct output for all specified cases.

Given this evidence and alignment between the program, the problem description, and the output hints, the function's correctness holds. Therefore, the final assessment remains as originally stated.
