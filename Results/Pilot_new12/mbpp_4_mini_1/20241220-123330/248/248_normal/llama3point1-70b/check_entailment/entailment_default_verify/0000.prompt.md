You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. For any valid input list (including an empty list), the function will produce the expected tuple representation of that list. It handles various edge cases such as:

- An empty list `[]` converts to an empty tuple `()`.
- A list with integers, strings, or mixed types will be correctly converted to a tuple.

Since the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any apparent missing logic or edge cases, the correctness is confirmed as true.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `input_list`, which can be a list of any data type, and returns a tuple that contains all elements from `input_list`. If `input_list` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle or process any potential issues related to the contents of `input_list`, such as nested lists or data types that may not be easily convertible into a tuple, but it will still successfully convert the provided input list into a tuple regardless of the data types contained within.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
