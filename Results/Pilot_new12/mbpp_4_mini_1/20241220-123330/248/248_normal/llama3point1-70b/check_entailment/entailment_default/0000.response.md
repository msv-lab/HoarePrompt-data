Explanation: The provided function correctly converts a list into a tuple. It is straightforward and operates as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function handles any list of elements and returns a tuple that includes all elements, and it correctly produces an empty tuple for an empty list. The code does not need to handle specific types within the list since the problem only requires conversion to a tuple and does not impose constraints on the elements. Thus, we see no cases where the function behaves incorrectly regarding the provided problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
