Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. For any valid input list (including an empty list), the function will produce the expected tuple representation of that list. It handles various edge cases such as:

- An empty list `[]` converts to an empty tuple `()`.
- A list with integers, strings, or mixed types will be correctly converted to a tuple.

Since the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any apparent missing logic or edge cases, the correctness is confirmed as true.
