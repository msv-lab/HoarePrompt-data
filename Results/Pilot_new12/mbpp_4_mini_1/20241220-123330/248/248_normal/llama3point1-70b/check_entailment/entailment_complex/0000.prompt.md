You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list of any data type.
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
    #The program returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `input_list`, which can be a list of any data type, and returns a tuple that contains all elements from `input_list`. If `input_list` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle or process any potential issues related to the contents of `input_list`, such as nested lists or data types that may not be easily convertible into a tuple, but it will still successfully convert the provided input list into a tuple regardless of the data types contained within.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
