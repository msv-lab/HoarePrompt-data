Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as per the problem description. It handles various cases, including converting a list of any data type to a tuple and returning an empty tuple when given an empty list. The output hints confirm this functionality, stating that the function will successfully convert the provided input list into a tuple regardless of the types contained within, and that it does not raise errors or fail due to the content of the list.

Since the problem description specifies that valid input will be provided and does not require special handling for nested lists or incompatible types, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases described. Thus, the function is deemed correct.
