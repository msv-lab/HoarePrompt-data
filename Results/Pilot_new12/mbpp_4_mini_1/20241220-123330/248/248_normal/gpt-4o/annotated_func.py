#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any type of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing all elements from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements of any type. It converts the list into a tuple and returns this tuple. If `lst` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not perform any validation on the contents of `lst`, meaning it can contain any type of elements, including nested lists, None, or any other object.
