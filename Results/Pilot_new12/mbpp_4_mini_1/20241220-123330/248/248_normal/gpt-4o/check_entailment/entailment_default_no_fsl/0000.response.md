Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list into a tuple as described in the problem statement. It meets the requirements for all potential cases, including:

1. Converting a non-empty list to a tuple, as demonstrated by the assertions that show various lists being successfully converted.
2. Returning an empty tuple when given an empty list, as a tuple conversion of an empty list yields an empty tuple `()`.
3. Handling lists that contain elements of any type, including nested lists or `None`, as the function simply uses `tuple()` without specific validations.

Since the assumptions state that the input will always be valid, the function performs correctly under the constraints provided. The output hints align with the functionality of the program, confirming its correctness across various scenarios. There are no identified edge cases where the behavior would not match the requirements of the problem description.
