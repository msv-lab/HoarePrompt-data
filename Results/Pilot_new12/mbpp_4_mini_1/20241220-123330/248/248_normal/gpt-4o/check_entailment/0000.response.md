Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It does this by using the built-in `tuple()` function, which accurately transforms any input list into a tuple. The provided test cases confirm that this function behaves correctly for a variety of inputs, including lists of varying lengths and integer values. Since the conversion from list to tuple does not have edge cases or exceptions that it needs to handle for the types of inputs described, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
