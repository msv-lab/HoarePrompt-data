Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list as an input and converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. It correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function will return a tuple containing the original elements of the list and correctly handle an empty list by returning an empty tuple. Since it does not impose any restrictions on the types of elements in the list and operates as expected for all described scenarios, the implementation is indeed correct for every potential case.
