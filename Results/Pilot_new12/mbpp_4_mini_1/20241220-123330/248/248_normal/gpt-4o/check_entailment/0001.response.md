Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list as input and correctly converts it into a tuple. The provided assertions in the program cover multiple cases of lists with varying lengths and contents, and they all correctly validate the expected output of the function.

### Rationale:
1. The function uses Python's built-in `tuple()` constructor, which is designed specifically to convert iterable structures (like lists) into tuples. This guarantees that the function behaves correctly for any valid list input.
2. It handles empty lists as well, converting them to an empty tuple, which is also a valid and expected behavior.
3. There are no constraints in the problem description that the program fails to address.

Since I cannot identify a case where the program fails, I conclude that it meets the problem requirements completely.
