Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the program's functionality as meeting the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` utilizes the built-in `tuple()` constructor, which is appropriate for this purpose. The assertions provided cover various scenarios, including lists of different lengths and contents, and all evaluate to the expected tuple outputs. 

The annotations confirm that before calling the function, the input (`lst`) is defined as a list of any type of elements, and the function returns a tuple of these elements without exceptions. Furthermore, since we assume that the input will always be valid, the program does not need to handle non-list or invalid cases, which further supports the assessment of correctness.

Overall, both the original assessment and the annotations align in affirming the correctness of the program in fulfilling the stated requirement of converting a list to a tuple.
