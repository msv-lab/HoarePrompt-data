Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` performs as intended by converting a list into a tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The assertions validate the functionality across various input scenarios, confirming the correctness of the implementation. Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function can handle lists of any data type and returns an empty tuple if given an empty list. The program does not need to perform validation on the contents of `lst`, as we assume valid input based on the problem description. Therefore, all aspects of the program meet the criteria outlined in the initial assessment.
