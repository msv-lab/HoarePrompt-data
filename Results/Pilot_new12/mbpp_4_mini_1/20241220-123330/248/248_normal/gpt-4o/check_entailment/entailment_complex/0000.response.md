Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to write a function that converts a list to a tuple. 

Here's why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list.

2. **Conversion to Tuple**: The core functionality of the function is implemented using the `tuple()` constructor. This directly converts the list `lst` to a tuple, thereby achieving the goal of the problem description.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the tuple created from the list. If the input list is empty, the function appropriately returns an empty tuple, which is also consistent with the behavior expected from converting an empty list.

4. **No Input Validation Needed**: The problem statement specifies that we assume valid input will be provided. Therefore, the lack of validation on the contents of `lst` does not affect the correctness of the function.

Thus, since the function accurately converts any given list into a tuple (including handling empty lists correctly), it adheres to the specified problem description perfectly.
