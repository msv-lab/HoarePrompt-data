Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` successfully converts a list of any type of elements into a tuple, as confirmed by the assert statements which test various lists with expected results. The output hints also reinforce that the function behaves as expected, returning an empty tuple for an empty input list and being flexible with the types of elements it can process. There are no indicated edge cases in the problem description that the function fails to handle, and the assumption of valid input further supports the correctness of the implementation. Thus, the conclusion that the program meets the requirements is justified.
