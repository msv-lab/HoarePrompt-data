Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description of converting a list to a tuple, as the function `func_1` correctly implements the `tuple()` function to achieve this. The annotated version supports this by confirming that the function receives a list and returns its elements as a tuple. The provided test cases effectively demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs. Since we are assuming valid input will be provided, the program does not need to handle any errors related to input validation, adhering to the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
