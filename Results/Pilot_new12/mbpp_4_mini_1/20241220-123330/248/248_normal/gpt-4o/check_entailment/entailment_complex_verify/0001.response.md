Final: **True**

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, which is supported by the provided annotations and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using Pythonâ€™s built-in `tuple()` constructor. The assertions validate various cases, including normal lists of integers and an empty list scenario, all yielding the expected results. 

The annotations corroborate this by clarifying that the function is designed to accept a list of any type of elements and returns a corresponding tuple. There is also acknowledgement that the function does not require validation for the contents of the list, as it is assumed that users will provide valid input according to the problem description. 

Since there are no discrepancies between the program's output and the problem requirements, and because the function behaves correctly under the described assumptions, the assessment of correctness remains accurate.
