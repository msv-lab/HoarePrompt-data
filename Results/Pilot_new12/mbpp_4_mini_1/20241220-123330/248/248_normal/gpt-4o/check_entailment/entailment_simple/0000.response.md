Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The task was to convert a list to a tuple. The function takes a list `lst` as its input and uses the built-in `tuple()` function to perform the conversion.

Here's the reasoning for the correctness:

1. **Functionality**: The function directly returns the result of `tuple(lst)`, which translates the list into a tuple, effectively fulfilling the requirement to convert a list to a tuple.

2. **Valid Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program test various scenarios where different lists are passed to `func_1`, and in each case, the output matches the expected tuple. The function correctly converts each provided list into a tuple, demonstrating that it works for an array of inputs.

3. **Assumption Handling**: The problem states that inputs will be valid and that the function does not need to handle invalid cases. Therefore, since all expected inputs conform to the guidelines, the functionâ€™s design remains correct.

In conclusion, `func_1` consistently and correctly converts any valid list input into a corresponding tuple as required by the problem description.
