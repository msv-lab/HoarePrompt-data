The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements of any type. It converts the list into a tuple and returns this tuple. If `lst` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not perform any validation on the contents of `lst`, meaning it can contain any type of elements, including nested lists, None, or any other object.
