#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' as it is, regardless of the values of 'first_index' and 'last_index' since they do not affect the return of 's'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index` (indicating that `ch` occurs multiple times in `s`).
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string 's' with the first and last occurrences of character 'ch' removed, taking the substring from the start of 's' to 'first_index' (not including 'first_index'), then the substring from 'first_index + 1' to 'last_index' (not including 'last_index'), and finally the substring from 'last_index + 1' to the end of 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It checks for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` occurs multiple times, it returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. The function handles edge cases where `ch` is not found in `s` and where `ch` only appears once, ensuring that `s` is returned unchanged in those scenarios.
