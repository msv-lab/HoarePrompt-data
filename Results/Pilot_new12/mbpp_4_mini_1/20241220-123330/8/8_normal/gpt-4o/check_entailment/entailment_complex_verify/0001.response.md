The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False**, highlighting that it does not handle the case where the character to be removed is the only character in the string (e.g., `func_1('a', 'a')` should return an empty string but would return `'a'` instead).

Upon reviewing the program and the provided annotated version, I find that the assessment remains accurate. The function checks whether the character appears more than once in the string and only removes the first and last occurrences in cases where `first_index` is different from `last_index`. 

In the case of a single character string like `'a'` with `ch` as `'a'`, the indexes would be equal, and the function would rightly return the string itself (`'a'`) instead of an empty string. This behavior does not meet the problem description's requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of the character entirely.

The annotations affirm this behavior by illustrating that when `first_index` and `last_index` are equal, the function bypasses the substring manipulation and simply returns the original string.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment regarding the inability of the function to handle the specified case correctly reflects the program's behavior accurately.

Final: **False**
