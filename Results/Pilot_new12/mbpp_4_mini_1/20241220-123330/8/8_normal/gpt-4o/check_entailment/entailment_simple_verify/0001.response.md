The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because it fails to handle the case where the input string consists of a single character that equals the character to be removed. The code does not correctly return an empty string when `func_1('a', 'a')` is called, instead, it would return `'a'` due to the condition that checks whether the first and last indices are the same.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior. The annotations clarify that when the character to be removed is the only character in the string, the check for `first_index == last_index` results in the function returning the original string `s`, which contradicts the problem's requirement to remove the character.

Because the program does not meet the specified conditions of the problem description—specifically, failing to return an empty string when the only character in the string is the one requested for removal—the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.

Thus, based on the problem description, original assessment, and annotated version of the code, I conclude:

Final: **False**
