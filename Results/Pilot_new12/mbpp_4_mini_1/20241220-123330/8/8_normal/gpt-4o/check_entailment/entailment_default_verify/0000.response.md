The original assessment correctly identifies that the function has a critical flaw when handling cases where the character occurs multiple times, particularly when it appears at the start and end of the string. 

The output hints reinforce this point by clarifying that the function is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` in `s`, but it does not account for scenarios where the character appears at both positions. Specifically, in cases such as `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`, the function would return 'aaaa' instead of an empty string as expected. 

Thus, the analysis performed in the original assessment is validated by the output hints and demonstrates a clear inconsistency with the requirements of the problem description, which calls for both the first and last occurrences of the character to be removed.

Final: **False**
