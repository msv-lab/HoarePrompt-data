The given problem description specifies that the program should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

Hereâ€™s an analysis of the program:

- The function uses `s.find(ch)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch`, and `s.rfind(ch)` for the last occurrence.
- If both indices are found or if they are the same, the function returns the original string without modification.
- The construction of the return value excludes the characters at these indices.

Now, we can identify edge cases that the program might not address:

1. If the character `ch` does not exist in the string, both `first_index` and `last_index` will be `-1`, and the function will return the original string, which is correct.
2. If the character `ch` is present only once (for example, `func_1('a', 'a')`), the character at its index (both first and last) will be the same; hence the function will return the original string, which is also correct.
3. However, a critical case is when the character appears multiple times but only at the beginning and end of the string (for example, `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`). In this case, the function will wrongly return the string without removing anything when it should return an empty string.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect. 

Correctness: **False**.
