Correctness: **True**

The provided program satisfies the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the function meets the problem requirements:

1. **Finding First and Last Occurrences**: The function uses `s.find(ch)` to find the index of the first occurrence of character `ch` in the string `s`, and `s.rfind(ch)` to determine the index of the last occurrence of `ch`. This is essential for removing the correct instances of the character.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `ch` does not exist in `s` (`first_index` or `last_index` is -1), or if `ch` appears only once in the string (where `first_index` equals `last_index`), the function correctly returns the original string `s`. This approach ensures that no removal occurs when it is not appropriate to do so.
   - If `ch` appears multiple times, the function constructs a new string that excludes the characters at both `first_index` and `last_index`. It concatenates the portions of `s` before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence.

3. **Accurate Assertions**: The assertions provided at the beginning of the code correctly validate that the function performs as expected for various inputs.

Thus, the function handles all specified cases according to the problem description, verifying that it conforms to the requirements.
