After analyzing the annotated version of the code and considering the problem description, the reasoning aligns with the original assessment. 

The function is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a character `ch` in the string `s`. The annotations indicate the function's behavior under different conditions, clearly stating how the function behaves when the character is not found or when it appears only once. However, the crucial failure point identified in the original assessment persists: when the character appears multiple times at the beginning and end of the string (e.g., `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`), the function does not remove those occurrences properly, returning the original string instead of an empty string.

Thus, the conclusion of the original assessment remains valid based on a consistent understanding from both the code and the annotations. 

Final: **False**.
