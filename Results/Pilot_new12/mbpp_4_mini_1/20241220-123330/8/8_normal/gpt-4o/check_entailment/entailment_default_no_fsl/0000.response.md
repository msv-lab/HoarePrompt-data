Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` are the same, which leads to incorrect behavior. For instance, consider the input `func_1("aaaa", "a")`. 

In this case, both the first and last occurrence of `a` are at index 0, and since they are the same, the program will return the original string `s` ('aaaa') instead of removing that single occurrence of 'a', which violates the requirement to remove both occurrences.

Thus, there is a missing case where the first and last occurrence of `ch` are the same, meaning the program's logic does not fully align with the problem description requirements.
