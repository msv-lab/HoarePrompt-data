You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' as it is, regardless of the values of 'first_index' and 'last_index' since they do not affect the return of 's'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index` (indicating that `ch` occurs multiple times in `s`).
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string 's' with the first and last occurrences of character 'ch' removed, taking the substring from the start of 's' to 'first_index' (not including 'first_index'), then the substring from 'first_index + 1' to 'last_index' (not including 'last_index'), and finally the substring from 'last_index + 1' to the end of 's'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
