The program provided is intended to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. 

Let's analyze the code in detail considering the problem description and the output hints:

1. The code checks for the first and last index of the character `ch` in the string `s` using `s.find(ch)` and `s.rfind(ch)`.
2. If either occurrence is not found (i.e., `first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), or if the first and last indexes are the same (indicating that `ch` appears only once), the function returns the original string `s`.
3. If the first and last occurrences are found and they are different, the function constructs a new string excluding the character at these indices.

This implementation generally follows the problem description. However, we need to verify its correctness by analyzing different inputs:

- For `func_1('hello', 'l')`, it correctly returns `'heo'`.
- For `func_1('abcda', 'a')`, it correctly returns `'bcd'`.
- For `func_1('PHP', 'P')`, it correctly returns `'H'`.

On closer inspection, let's consider an edge case where the character appears only at the boundaries of the string:
- For instance, calling `func_1('aabca', 'a')` should return `'abc'` but would actually return `'abca'`. The function fails to remove the first occurrence at index 0 and the last occurrence at index 4, because it does not account for how the construction of the new string handles indices.

Therefore, there are cases where the provided program does not work correctly according to the description of removing the first and last occurrences of a character.

Correctness: **False**.
