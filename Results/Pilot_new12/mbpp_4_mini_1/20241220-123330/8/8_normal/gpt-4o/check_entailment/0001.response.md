Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the character to be removed is the only character in the string. For example, if we call `func_1('a', 'a')`, the expected output should be an empty string (`''`), but the program would return `'a'` because the first and last occurrences are the same, resulting in the condition `first_index == last_index` returning true and thus returning the original string. 

Therefore, for this input case, the program does not meet the problem description requirements.
