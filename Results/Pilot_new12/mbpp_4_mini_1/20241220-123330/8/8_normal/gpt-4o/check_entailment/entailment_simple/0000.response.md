Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. According to the problem description, the task is to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string. However, if the character occurs only once in the string (which constitutes the first and last occurrence simultaneously), the program returns the original string `s` instead of removing that character.

For example:
- If the input is `('x', 'x')`, the program would return `'x'`, which contradicts the problem requirement. According to the problem description, since 'x' is both the first and last occurrence, it should be removed, resulting in an empty string `''`.

Therefore, the program fails to handle the case where the character appears only once, thus it does not always conform to the problem description.
