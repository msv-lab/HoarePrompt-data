The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It checks for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` occurs multiple times, it returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. The function handles edge cases where `ch` is not found in `s` and where `ch` only appears once, ensuring that `s` is returned unchanged in those scenarios.
