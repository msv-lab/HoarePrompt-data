The code assigns `last_index` the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which returns the highest index in the string `s` where the substring `ch` is found. If `ch` is not present in `s`, `last_index` will be -1. 

The variable `first_index` previously held either the index of `ch` in `s` (if found) or -1 (if not found). The new value of `last_index` will now depend on the initial state of `s` and `ch`. 

If `ch` is found multiple times in `s`, `last_index` will be greater than or equal to `first_index`. If `ch` is absent in `s`, `last_index` will be -1. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will depend on whether `ch` was found or not and what the relationship between `first_index` and `last_index` is.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
