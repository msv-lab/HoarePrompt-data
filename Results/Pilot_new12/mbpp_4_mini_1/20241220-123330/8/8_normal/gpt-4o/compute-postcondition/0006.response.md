The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string, and a parameter `ch`, which is a single character string. In Case_1, the function returns the string `s` as it is, regardless of any other variables. In Case_2, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` removed, by constructing a new substring that excludes those occurrences. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, returning either the original string `s` or a modified version of `s` with the specified character removed at both ends. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, returning the original string `s` or a modified version of `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
