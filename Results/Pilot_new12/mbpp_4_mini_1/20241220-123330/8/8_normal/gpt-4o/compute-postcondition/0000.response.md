The variable `first_index` is assigned the value obtained from the `find` method of the string `s`, which returns the lowest index of the substring `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, `first_index` will be set to -1. The value of `s` and `ch` remains unchanged, so only `first_index` is affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
