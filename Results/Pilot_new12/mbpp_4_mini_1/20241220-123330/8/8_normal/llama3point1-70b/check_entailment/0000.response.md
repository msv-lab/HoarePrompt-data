To assess the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze whether the program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Here's the key functionality based on the problem description:

1. **Identify the first occurrence** of the character in the string.
2. **Identify the last occurrence** of the character in the string.
3. If the character is found:
   - If both occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), it should remove that single occurrence.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the program should remove only those two occurrences.

Now let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)  # Find the first occurrence of 'char'
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)  # Find the last occurrence of 'char'
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:  # If 'char' is found
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:  # If there is only one occurrence
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)  # Replace that single occurrence
        else:  # If there are multiple occurrences
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s  # If 'char' is not found, return the original string
```

### Case Analysis

1. **Single Occurrence Input**: If the string is "a" and the character is "a", the function should return an empty string. This is correctly handled.
  
2. **Multiple Occurrences Input**: For the input "banana" with character 'a', we expect it to return "ban". The first 'a' at index 1 and the last 'a' at index 5 should both be removed. This is correctly handled.

3. **No Occurrence Input**: For the input "hello" with character 'z', the function returns "hello", which is correct since the character does not exist.

4. **Edge Cases**: An edge case is the input string where the character to be removed is found at the very beginning or very end. For instance, given the string "racecar" and the character 'r', it should return "aceca" (removing the first and last 'r'). However, the current logic will work here as well.

5. **Invalid Character Cases**: If the character is not present in the string, the function returns the original string, which is correct.

### Potential Case Issue

Let's consider an edge case where the character to be removed appears in other forms or characters. For example:

- Input: `s = "pop"`, `char = "p"` should ideally return `"o"` since both 'p's should be removed. However, the logic for slicing and reconstructing the string does not account for cases where the occurrences overlap or are adjacent.

In summary, while the basic premise of removing the first and last occurrences is mostly handled, the program fails to sufficiently account for certain edge cases (like multiple adjacent occurrences or overlapping cases) which makes it unable to handle all expected scenarios flawlessly.

Correctness: **False**.
