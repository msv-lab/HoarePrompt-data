To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the program and the output hints thoroughly.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)  # Finds the index of the first occurrence of char
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)   # Finds the index of the last occurrence of char
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:  # Only one occurrence
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)  # Removes it once
        else:
            # Removes both the first and last occurrences
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s  # char does not occur in s, return original string
```

**Output Hints:** The function modifies the string based on occurrences of `char`:
- If `char` occurs exactly once, it removes it from `s` once.
- If `char` occurs multiple times, it returns the substring excluding both the first and last occurrences.
- If `char` does not occur, it returns the original string.
However, it does not handle cases where `char` might be an empty string or if `s` is empty.

**Missing Cases:**
1. **Empty String Input:** If `s` is an empty string (`s = ""`), the program returns `""`. This follows the description since there is nothing to remove, but it doesn't trigger any specific condition.
2. **Empty Character Input:** If `char` is an empty string (`char = ""`), the behavior is not defined by the problem. The function would effectively be trying to find the index of an empty string, which could lead to unexpected behavior since the `.find` and `.rfind` methods would always return 0, and the function would incorrectly manipulate the string.
3. **Valid Inputs Case:** The program should handle the valid cases correctly according to the problem description, removing first and last occurrences of `char` as intended.

**Conclusion:**
Thus, while the function works for the described expected cases, it has not been constructed to handle edge cases, specifically when the character is empty. According to the directive, failing to manage every potential case means the correctness of the function is in question.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program would fail for the case where `char` is an empty string, as it would attempt to treat it as a legitimate character to find in `s`.
