To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to create a function that removes the **first** and **last** occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program Walkthrough
1. The function begins by using `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and `s.rfind(char)` to locate the last occurrence of `char`.
2. It checks if both occurrences exist (i.e., `first_occurrence` is not -1 and `last_occurrence` is not -1).
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it indicates that `char` occurs exactly once in the string, and the program removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it joins the slices of the string before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding them), and after the last occurrence to return a string without the first and last occurrences of `char`.
3. If `char` is not found at all (either first or last occurrence is -1), it simply returns `s` unchanged.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description
- **Correct Handling of Single Occurrence**: The program correctly removes the character if it appears only once in the string, which aligns with the requirement in the problem description.
- **Correct Removal of Multiple Occurrences**: When `char` appears more than once, both the first and last occurrences are correctly identified and excluded from the result.
- **No Changes When Character is Absent**: If the character does not exist in the string, the function returns the original string, which is also correct behavior.

### Edge Cases
1. If `s` contains two or more occurrences of `char`, the function properly excludes both the first and the last occurrences.
2. If the character doesn't exist in the string, it returns the string unchanged.
3. If `char` appears only once, it removes it as needed.

Based on this thorough evaluation, the function consistently adheres to the requirements of the problem description within all expected scenarios.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the functionality to remove the first and last occurrences of a character from a string.

Correctness: **True**
