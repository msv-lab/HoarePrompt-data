Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for the case where the `char` input might be an empty string. If the `char` parameter is an empty string, the program will not function as expected since it is trying to find the position of an empty character in the string `s`, which does not have a defined behavior in this context.

For example, if we call `func_1("hello", "")`, the function does not handle this scenario properly, and the expected behavior is not defined in the problem description. According to the output hints, the program should be able to handle cases where the `char` might be absent or an empty string; hence, the lack of handling for an empty `char` leads to its incorrectness.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for at least one potential case.
