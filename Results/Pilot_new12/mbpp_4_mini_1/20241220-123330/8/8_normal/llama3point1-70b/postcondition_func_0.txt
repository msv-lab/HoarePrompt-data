The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`, and modifies the string based on the occurrences of `char`. If `char` occurs exactly once in `s`, it removes `char` from `s` once. If `char` occurs multiple times, it returns the substring of `s` that excludes both the first and last occurrences of `char`. If `char` does not occur in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s`. The function is designed to handle cases where `char` is either absent, present once, or present multiple times. However, it does not account for cases where `char` might be an empty string or if the string `s` is empty. In such cases, it will return the string `s` unaffected.
