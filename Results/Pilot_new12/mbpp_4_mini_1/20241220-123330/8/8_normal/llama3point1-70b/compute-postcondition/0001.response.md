The `last_occurrence` variable is assigned the value of the last index of `char` found in the string `s`. If `char` is not in `s`, `last_occurrence` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, if `char` is found in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be the last index of that occurrence; if not found, it remains -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not found, `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not found.**
