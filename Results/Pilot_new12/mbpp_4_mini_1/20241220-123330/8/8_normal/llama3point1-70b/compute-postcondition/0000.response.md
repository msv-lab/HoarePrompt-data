In this case, `first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which returns the lowest index in the string `s` where the substring `char` is found. If `char` is not found, it returns -1. The variables `s` and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes `s` as a string and `char` as a single character and specifies the value of `first_occurrence`.

Since the precise values of `s` and `char` are not given, we state the result in terms of their relationships.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, and `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not found.**
