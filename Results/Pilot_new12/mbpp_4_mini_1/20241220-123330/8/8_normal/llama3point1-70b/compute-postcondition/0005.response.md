Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not found, `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not found. The current value of `first_occurrence` is not -1, the current value of `last_occurrence` is not -1, and `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`, indicating that `char` appears multiple times in `s`.***
