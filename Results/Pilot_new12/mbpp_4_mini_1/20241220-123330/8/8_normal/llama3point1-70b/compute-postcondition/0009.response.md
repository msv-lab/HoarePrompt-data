The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character. After executing the function body: 

- If `char` occurs exactly once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the character `char` removed once. 
- If `char` occurs more than once in `s`, the function returns the substring of `s` that excludes the first and last occurrence of `char`. 
- If `char` does not occur in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, and based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`, it returns a modified version of the string `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` (a string) and `char` (a single character), and returns a modified string based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `char` occurs exactly once, it removes `char` once from `s`. If `char` occurs multiple times, it returns `s` excluding the first and last occurrence. If `char` does not occur, it returns the original string `s`.**
