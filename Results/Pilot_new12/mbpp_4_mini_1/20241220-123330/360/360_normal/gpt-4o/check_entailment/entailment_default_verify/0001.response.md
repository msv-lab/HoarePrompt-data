Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The program accurately computes and returns the sublist that has the maximum sum of elements from the list of lists, fulfilling the functionality described. 

The function initializes a variable (`max_sum`) to negative infinity, ensuring that any valid sum of elements will be greater. It then iterates through each sublist, computes the sum, and updates the `max_sum` and `max_list` when a higher sum is found. This logic ensures that the sublist with the highest sum is returned.

The output hints elaborate on the specifics of the functionality, including the behavior if `list_of_lists` is empty (returning an empty list) and the risk of runtime errors with non-numeric elements in the sublists. However, as stated in the problem, the assumption is that the input will be valid, which aligns with the criteria for correctness in this context. 

Given that all assertions test cases return expected results and that there are no unhandled edge cases that could affect functionality based on the assumptions provided, the conclusion of the original assessment stands firm. Therefore, the function is verified as correct.
