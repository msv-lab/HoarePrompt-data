The provided program is designed to return the sublist from a list of lists with the highest sum of its elements. Let's analyze the code and the output hints to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

1. **Code Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates its sum, and compares it to an ongoing maximum sum (`max_sum`). If a sublist has a higher sum than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to that sublist.

2. **Output Hints**: The hints detail that the function will:
   - Identify and return the sublist with the maximum sum.
   - Return the first sublist with the maximum sum if there are ties.
   - Return an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
   - Potentially cause a runtime error if there are non-numeric elements in any sublist since these would cause `sum()` to fail.

3. **Testing with Given Assertions**: The provided assertions in the code indicate that the function returns the correct sublists when given normal inputs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will indeed return `max_list`, which is initialized as an empty list.
   - **Non-numeric Elements**: If any of the sublists contained non-numeric elements (e.g., strings or `None`), the function would crash due to a `TypeError` when attempting to sum them, resulting in an incorrect handling of such cases.

Although the function behaves correctly for all valid cases and appropriately handles the expected input structure as per the problem description, it does not safeguard against non-numeric elements, which theoretically could occur based on the problem specification stating it accepts lists containing integers or floats. This failure to handle potential input issues suggests the function is incomplete per the problem description.

Therefore, there's at least one scenario where the program could fail to perform correctly. 

Correctness: **False**.
