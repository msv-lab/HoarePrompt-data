You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is equal to the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is equal to the sublist that has this maximum sum, and `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists which may be empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_sum` remains float('-inf') and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist 'max_list' that has the maximum sum from 'list_of_lists', which may be empty. If 'list_of_lists' is empty, 'max_list' remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It identifies and returns the sublist from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the first one encountered is returned. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Additionally, if any sublist within `list_of_lists` consists of non-numeric elements, it could cause a runtime error, as the function does not handle such cases. The final state of the program indicates that `max_list` will contain the sublist with the highest sum or remain an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
