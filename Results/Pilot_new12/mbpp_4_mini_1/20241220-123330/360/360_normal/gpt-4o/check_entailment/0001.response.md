Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist whose elements sum to the highest value. 

- The variable `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity, ensuring that any sum of the sublists will be larger than this initial value.
- The function iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and compares it to `max_sum`.
- If a sublist has a greater sum than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
- Finally, it returns `max_list`, which correctly represents the sublist with the highest sum.

The assertions provided test different scenarios and the function returns the expected results in each case. 

No edge cases or potential inputs were found that would cause the function to misbehave or yield incorrect results according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
