Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. It iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the highest sum and associated sublist. 

All test cases provided validate the implementation:
1. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` correctly returns `[10, 11, 12]` since its sum (33) is greater than other sublists.
2. `func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]])` returns `[12, 11, 10]` with the highest sum of 33.
3. `func_1([[2, 3, 1]])` returns `[2, 3, 1]`, which is the only sublist and thus valid.

Since the program handles these test cases correctly and does not have any edge cases indicated that would fail, it is deemed correct. All input scenarios, including single-element lists or varying list lengths, are accounted for by the way the function is structured.
