Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s how the function `func_1` meets the criteria:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list consists of numerical elements (integers or floats), as expected.

2. **Finding Maximum Sum**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. During the iteration over `list_of_lists`, it computes the sum of each sublist (`current_sum`) and compares it with `max_sum`.

3. **Updating Maximums**: If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list`. This ensures that by the end of the loop, `max_list` will contain the sublist with the highest total sum.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist that has the maximum sum of its elements. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list, as indicated in the annotations.

5. **Handling Multiple Sublists with Same Maximum Sum**: The function is designed to return the first sublist with the maximum sum if there are multiple sublists with the same sum, which aligns with the problem description.

Thus, the function successfully fulfills all the requirements specified in the problem description. It successfully identifies and returns the sublist from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements. The assumptions about valid input also align with the program's design, as there are no error-handling mechanisms for invalid inputs, consistent with the problem parameters.
