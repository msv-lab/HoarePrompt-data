Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to return the sublist from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion. It indicates that before the function call, the input is appropriately structured, and after executing the loop, the program retains the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist correctly. Additionally, the program will return the expected results for the provided test cases:

1. For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the program correctly identifies the sublist `[10, 11, 12]` with the highest sum.
2. For the input `[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]`, it correctly returns `[12, 11, 10]`.
3. For the input `[[2, 3, 1]]`, the only sublist `[2, 3, 1]` is correctly returned.

Further, the annotation states that in case of an empty input list, the function will return an empty list, which is a logical behavior for the problem stated. Given that the function handles the expected valid input as per the assumptions and retains correct behavior through its logic, the original assessment holds. Therefore, the final judgment on the correctness of the program remains **True**.
