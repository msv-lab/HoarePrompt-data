Final: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description as it lacks proper handling for certain edge cases as indicated in the output hints. Specifically, the output hints mention that if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function should return an empty list. However, the provided code will return an empty list for an empty input, and no explicit handling for non-numeric elements is implemented, which could lead to a runtime error if such elements are present. These factors suggest that while the function may work correctly for valid inputs, its robustness is not guaranteed, therefore it does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
