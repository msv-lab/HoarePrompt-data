Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements detailed in the problem description. Here is how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function takes in `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). The problem description specifies that the input will be valid, so the function does not need to handle invalid cases.

2. **Objective**: The aim of the function is to find and return the list from the input that has the highest sum of its elements. The implementation correctly iterates through each sublist, computes the sum of its elements, and keeps track of the maximum sum and corresponding sublist.

3. **Tracking Maximum**: The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. As it iterates, it checks if the current sublist's sum exceeds the `max_sum`. If it does, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum.

4. **Return Value**: After processing all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which will contain the sublist with the highest sum. If the input list is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list, which is a valid output given the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as when the input is a single sublist or when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, since it will return the first one it encounters with that maximum sum.

Since the function consistently adheres to the specifications of the problem description across all defined scenarios, it can be deemed correct.
