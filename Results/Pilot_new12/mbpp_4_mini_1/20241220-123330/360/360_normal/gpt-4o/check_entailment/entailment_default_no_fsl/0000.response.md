Correctness: **False**

While the function correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the maximum sum in most cases tested, it does not handle the situation where any sublist within `list_of_lists` contains non-numeric elements. This could lead to a runtime error due to the `sum()` function, which expects numbers. For example, if we consider the input `[[1, 2, 'a'], [4, 5, 6]]`, the program would raise a TypeError when it encounters the string 'a' in the first sublist. This invalid case is not accounted for, leading to incorrect handling of potential inputs. 

Thus, the function fails when given non-numeric values, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
