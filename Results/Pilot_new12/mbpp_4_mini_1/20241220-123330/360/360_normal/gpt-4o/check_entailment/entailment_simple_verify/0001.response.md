The original assessment concluded that the program is correct. Upon evaluating the provided annotated version and the program's behavior, I find that the original assessment is indeed justified:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists. This is aligned with the problem description.

2. **Variable Initialization and Logic**: 
   - `max_sum` starts at negative infinity, which ensures that any sum calculated from the sublists will be higher, avoiding any erroneous comparisons.
   - The logic in the loop iterates through each sublist, calculates the current sum, and compares it against `max_sum`. If it finds a greater sum, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list`.

3. **Return Value**: At the end of execution, `max_list` will contain the sublist with the maximum sum, or be an empty list if `list_of_lists` was empty (which is an assumption we made regarding valid input).

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided effectively test various scenarios, and the results confirm that the function behaves as expected.

5. **Annotations**: The annotations further clarify that before the function is called, `list_of_lists` is expected to be a valid list of numerical sublists, and after execution, `max_list` accurately captures the required output based on the highest sum. 

Given that all elements of the assessment and the annotations uphold the program's correctness relative to the original problem description, I conclude that the program is correctly function.

Final: **True**
