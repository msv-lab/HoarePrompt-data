According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, the loop will execute one more time for the third sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists. Assuming the current sublist being processed is the second one, the next index would be for the third sublist.

For the loop to be executed one more time:
- `max_sum` remains greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`,
- `max_list` will still be equal to `sublist` (the second sublist),
- `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 sublists, 
- and now the loop will process the third `sublist`.

State: **`max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, and the next `sublist` is the third sublist.**
