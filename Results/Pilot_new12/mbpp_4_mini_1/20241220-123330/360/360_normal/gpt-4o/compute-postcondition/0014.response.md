To determine the output state after running the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact on the program:

1. We know that `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. 
2. The initial state indicates that `max_sum` is greater than negative infinity and equal to `current_sum`. This means that after executing the line of code, `current_sum` will have a specific value, which is the result of summing up the `sublist`.
3. Since `max_sum` is stated to be equal to `current_sum`, after the execution of the line `current_sum = sum(sublist)`, `max_sum` will now also be equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.

The values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` are interdependent since `max_sum` is initially equal to `current_sum`. The specific numerical values depend on the content of `sublist`, but both `max_sum` and `current_sum` will be equal to the result of `sum(sublist)`.

Given that `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists and we are concerned with the third sublist, we conclude that the calculations are tied to the data from that sublist.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` which is now the sum of `sublist`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, and the next `sublist` is the third sublist.**
