Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, and `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist with `current_sum` being the sum of elements in `sublist` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains the same, and `max_list` remains unchanged.***
