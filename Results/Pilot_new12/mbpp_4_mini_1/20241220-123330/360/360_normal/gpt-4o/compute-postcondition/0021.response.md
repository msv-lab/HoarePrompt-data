Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It identifies and returns the sublist from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the first one encountered is returned. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Additionally, if any sublist within `list_of_lists` consists of non-numeric elements, it could cause a runtime error, as the function does not handle such cases. The final state of the program indicates that `max_list` will contain the sublist with the highest sum or remain an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.**
