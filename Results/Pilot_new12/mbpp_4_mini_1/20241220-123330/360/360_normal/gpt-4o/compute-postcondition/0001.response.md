`max_list` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables, `list_of_lists` and `max_sum`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), and `max_list` is an empty list. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list**
