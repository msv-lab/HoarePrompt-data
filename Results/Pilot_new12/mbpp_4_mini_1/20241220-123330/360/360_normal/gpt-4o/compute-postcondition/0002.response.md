According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least one sublist, the loop will execute. The current values of `max_sum` and `max_list` before the loop starts do not affect the execution of the loop; they can be adjusted within the loop anyway. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist. At the start of the loop, `sublist` should refer to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists**
