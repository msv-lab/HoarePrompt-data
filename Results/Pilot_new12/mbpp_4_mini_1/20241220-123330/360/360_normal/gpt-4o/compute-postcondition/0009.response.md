The `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. Given that `sublist` is a part of `list_of_lists`, which has at least two sublists, the specific value of `current_sum` will be the total of all the elements present in `sublist`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
