According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, which is expected to contain at least one sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, which indicates that a sublist was evaluated. In each iteration, `sublist` is updated to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Since `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, if the loop is to execute one more time, we must consider the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. If we assume there are at least 2 sublists, it implies that `sublist` will change with each iteration, and the index associated with `sublist` would increase.

Given that `current_sum` may or may not change depending on the next `sublist`, the relevant state parameters for the next iteration would include an updated `sublist`, but the values of `max_sum`, `max_list`, and the current iteration status regarding the sums need to be clear.

Thus, the state must reflect the expectation that a second sublist exists and be set to reflect that `sublist` has changed.

State: **`max_sum` is greater than float('-inf') and equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
