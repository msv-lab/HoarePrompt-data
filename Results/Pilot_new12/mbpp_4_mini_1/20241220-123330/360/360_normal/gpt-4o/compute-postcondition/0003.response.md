`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of elements in `sublist`. Since `max_sum` is initially `float('-inf')`, it remains unchanged unless `current_sum` exceeds it. The variable `max_list` is still an empty list, and the initial conditions of `list_of_lists` remain valid with at least one sublist that is being referenced as `sublist`. 

As `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of the first sublist's elements, we do not have specific values for `sublist` or its sum unless provided. Therefore, the final Output State describes the derived variables while holding the other conditions valid.

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of elements in `sublist`.**
