The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. As `max_list` was previously an empty list, it will now contain the same elements as `sublist`. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged, as it depends on `current_sum`, which is also unaffected by this operation. Since `current_sum` is the sum of elements in `sublist`, it holds the sum from before but does not change in this operation. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf'); `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist; `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of elements in `sublist`.**
