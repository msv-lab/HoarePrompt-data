The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Prior to this operation, `max_list` was equal to `sublist`, and after the assignment, it remains equal to `sublist`. Therefore, there is no change in the value of `max_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, and `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`.**
