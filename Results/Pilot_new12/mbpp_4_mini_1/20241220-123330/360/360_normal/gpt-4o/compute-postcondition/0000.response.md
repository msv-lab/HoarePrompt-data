The value of `max_sum` is assigned to `float('-inf')`, which represents negative infinity in Python. This sets a starting point for comparisons against potential sums of the inner lists. The state of the variable `list_of_lists` remains unchanged and unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats); `max_sum` is float('-inf').**
