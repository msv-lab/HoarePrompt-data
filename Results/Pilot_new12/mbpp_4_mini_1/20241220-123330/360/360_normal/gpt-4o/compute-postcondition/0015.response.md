The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. As `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, the previous reference to `max_sum` as equal to the sum of `sublist` still holds true as `current_sum` represents that sum.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of `sublist`; `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists; and the next `sublist` is the third sublist.**
