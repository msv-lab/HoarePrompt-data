#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is equal to the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is equal to the sublist that has this maximum sum, and `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists which may be empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_sum` remains float('-inf') and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist 'max_list' that has the maximum sum from 'list_of_lists', which may be empty. If 'list_of_lists' is empty, 'max_list' remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It identifies and returns the sublist from `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the first one encountered is returned. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Additionally, if any sublist within `list_of_lists` consists of non-numeric elements, it could cause a runtime error, as the function does not handle such cases. The final state of the program indicates that `max_list` will contain the sublist with the highest sum or remain an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
