The function accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the inner list from `lists` that has the highest sum of its integers. If `lists` is empty, the behavior is not explicitly handled, so it may raise a `ValueError` when calling `max()`. The function does not account for cases where multiple inner lists have the same highest sum; in such instances, it will return the first one it encounters.
