After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I can conclude the following:

1. The function `func_1` is designed to return the inner list from `lists` that has the highest sum of integers. This functionality aligns with the problem description.
2. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` to determine the list with the highest sum is appropriate and correct for this requirement.
3. The output hints indicate that the function may raise a `ValueError` if it is called with an empty list (`lists`). This is a significant aspect that was not addressed in the original assessment.
4. The original assessment stated that the function was correct and handled all cases. However, it did not acknowledge the potential issue with an empty input list. This can lead to an incorrect conclusion about the robustness of the code.

Given these considerations, the function can be deemed incorrect due to the unhandled case of an empty list input. Therefore, the original assessment fails to capture this limitation.

Final: **False**
