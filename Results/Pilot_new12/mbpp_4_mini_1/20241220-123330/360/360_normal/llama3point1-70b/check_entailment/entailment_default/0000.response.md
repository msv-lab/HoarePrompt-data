The program provided correctly implements a function to return the inner list from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The use of the `max()` function with `key=sum` effectively identifies the list with the maximum sum. 

However, the output hints specify that the function does not explicitly handle the case when the input list `lists` is empty. In such a situation, calling `max()` on an empty list will lead to a `ValueError`. Therefore, the program does not cover all potential cases described in the prompt. 

Moreover, while the hints mention the situation with multiple inner lists having the same highest sum, the function's behavior of returning the first one it encounters is acceptable as per the problem description, which does not specify a handling of ties. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The failure to handle an empty input list (leading to an error) means the function does not meet the problem description under all scenarios, hence it is considered incorrect.
