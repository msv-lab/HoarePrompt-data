Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If `lists` is an empty list, calling `max(lists, key=sum)` will raise a `ValueError` because there are no items to operate on. According to the problem description, the function needs to correctly handle every potential case, and an empty list scenario is a valid case that the program does not address. Hence, the program fails to meet the requirement. Additionally, while the function returns the first list in the event of a tie (which is a correct behavior), the lack of handling for an empty input is a more critical flaw, leading to its overall incorrectness.
