Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

1. It uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument, which means it evaluates the sum of each list and returns the one with the maximum sum.
2. It handles cases where:
   - All lists are empty, returning an empty list (if provided).
   - There are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, returning the first one encountered.
   - Mixed numeric types are not a concern as all elements in a list should ideally be of the same type (either all integers/floats).

No specific edge cases or incorrect behaviors can be identified as the implementation adheres strictly to the problem description. Thus, it fulfills the requirement correctly across potential input cases.
