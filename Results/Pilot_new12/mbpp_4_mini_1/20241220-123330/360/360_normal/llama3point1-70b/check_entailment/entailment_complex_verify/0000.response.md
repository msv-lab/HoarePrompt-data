Final: **False**

The original assessment incorrectly concludes that the program is correct without addressing a critical issue highlighted in the annotated version. Specifically, the function does not explicitly handle the case when an empty list is provided as input. While the assumption is made that input will be valid, the absence of handling for an empty list inherently makes the program potentially incorrect because it may raise a `ValueError` if called with an empty input. This should be considered a significant flaw, as the program's behavior does not align with the problem description's implied requirement for robustness in handling various input scenarios. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness should be marked as false due to the potential for unhandled exceptions.
