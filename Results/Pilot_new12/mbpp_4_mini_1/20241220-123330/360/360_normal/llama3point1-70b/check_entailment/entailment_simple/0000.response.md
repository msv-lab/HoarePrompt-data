Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists.
2. The function utilizes the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`. This means it will evaluate the sum of each inner list and return the inner list with the highest sum.
3. The function effectively identifies and returns the inner list that contains the integers summing to the largest total.

The description explicitly asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest, and the program achieves that functionality accurately by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements for any valid input according to the assumed constraints.
