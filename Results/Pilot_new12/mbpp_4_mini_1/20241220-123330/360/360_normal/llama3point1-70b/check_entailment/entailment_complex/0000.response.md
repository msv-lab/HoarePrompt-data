Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` receives a list of lists, each containing integers, and it utilizes Python's built-in `max` function with the `key=sum` argument to identify and return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements. 

Hereâ€™s how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Specification**: The function accepts a list of lists, assuming valid input as specified in the annotations. This aligns with the requirement.

2. **Correct Functionality**: The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` precisely selects the inner list with the highest sum, which is exactly what the problem requires.

3. **Behavior on Empty Lists**: Although the function does not explicitly handle an empty list (which could lead to a `ValueError`), the problem description states that we assume valid input will always be provided. Therefore, this does not detract from its correctness under the given assumptions.

4. **Handling Ties**: The function will return the first inner list encountered in the case of ties (multiple lists having the same maximum sum). While the problem description does not specify how to handle ties, returning the first one is a reasonable and common approach.

Considering all these factors, the function faithfully performs the task as described in the problem statement for any valid input scenario, thus it is correct.
