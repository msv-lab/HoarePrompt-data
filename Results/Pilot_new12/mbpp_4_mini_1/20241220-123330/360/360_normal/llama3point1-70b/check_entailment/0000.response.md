Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. It uses the built-in `max` function with the `key=sum`, which efficiently identifies the list with the maximum sum. 

The function works under the following scenarios:
1. If given lists with different lengths, it will correctly compute the sum of elements for each list.
2. If multiple lists have the same highest sum, `max` will return the first one it encounters.
3. If an empty list is provided as input, Python's `max` will raise an error, so it's assumed that the input will always be a non-empty list of lists or the function is not required to handle such cases based on the problem description.

As no edge case violates the problem's requirements, the program is functioning correctly.
