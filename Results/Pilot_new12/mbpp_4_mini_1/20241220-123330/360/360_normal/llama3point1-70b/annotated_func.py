#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the inner list from 'lists' that has the highest sum of its integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the inner list from `lists` that has the highest sum of its integers. If `lists` is empty, the behavior is not explicitly handled, so it may raise a `ValueError` when calling `max()`. The function does not account for cases where multiple inner lists have the same highest sum; in such instances, it will return the first one it encounters.
