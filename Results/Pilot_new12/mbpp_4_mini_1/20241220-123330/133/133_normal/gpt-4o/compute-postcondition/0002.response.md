Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which contain numerical elements of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements in `tup2` from `tup1`. The function assumes that both input tuples are of the same length; otherwise, it will raise a `ValueError` during the execution of `zip`. If either tuple is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The output tuple contains the computed differences of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.**
