The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that consists of the differences of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numerical elements and return a tuple containing the differences of their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, containing numerical elements, and returns a tuple with the differences of the corresponding elements from both tuples.**
