The provided code defines a function `func_1` that correctly implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples of the same length. The output hints mention that the function raises a `ValueError` when the input tuples are of different lengths, which aligns with the expectations since the subtraction operation assumes element-wise operations on tuples of identical lengths. 

The hints also clarify that if either tuple is empty, the function should return an empty tuple, which the current implementation correctly handles as well (by returning an empty tuple for empty tuples due to the behavior of `zip`).

Additionally, the function is tested with assertions, which verify that the code provides correct results for various scenarios. 

Importantly, the function does not specify behavior for cases where the input tuples are of different lengths, though it does raise an error (which is a reasonable implementation detail). Nonetheless, the problem description implies that the function should be designed to take two tuples that are the same length, and the provided output hints cover the expected behavior in those scenarios.

In conclusion, since the implementation adheres to the conditions specified in the problem description and given hints, covering the cases of equal length and empty tuples, it follows all stated requirements.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
