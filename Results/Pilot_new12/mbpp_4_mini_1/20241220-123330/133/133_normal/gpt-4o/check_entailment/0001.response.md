To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let’s analyze the code and consider possible edge cases.

The function `func_1` is designed to subtract corresponding elements of two tuples. Here’s what it does step by step:

1. It takes in two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`).
2. It uses `zip` to iterate through both tuples element by element.
3. It then subtracts the elements from `tup2` from those in `tup1`.
4. Finally, it returns a new tuple containing the results of these subtractions.

The provided assertions already test the function with three different tuple inputs. However, we should also consider edge cases, such as:

1. **Different Length Tuples**: If `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, `zip` will truncate to the shortest tuple, potentially missing elements from the longer tuple.
   - For example: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would return `(-2, -2)` but wouldn't consider the element `5` in `tup2`, leading to loss of information.
   
2. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, `func_1((), ())` should return `()`, which it does correctly. An input like `func_1((), (1,))`, however, will also lead to `()`.

3. **Non-Numeric Input**: The current implementation does not handle non-numeric inputs. For instance, `func_1((1, 2), (3, 'a'))` would raise a `TypeError` due to attempting to subtract a string from an integer.

Given these considerations, the program has potential cases where it does not meet the requirements:

- It does not handle tuples of different lengths gracefully.
- It does not validate that the elements of the tuples are numeric, which could lead to runtime errors.

Due to these issues, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
