Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires that two tuples be subtracted element-wise, which implies that they must have the same length. While the current implementation of `func_1` performs the subtraction as intended when given two tuples of the same length, there is no built-in check for the tuple lengths. As noted in the original assessment, if the function is provided with tuples of differing lengths, it would still proceed to calculate the results for the overlapping elements without producing an error or meaningful output for the mismatched sizes, thereby leading to unexpected results or logical errors. Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the stated requirements of the problem description, confirming the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
