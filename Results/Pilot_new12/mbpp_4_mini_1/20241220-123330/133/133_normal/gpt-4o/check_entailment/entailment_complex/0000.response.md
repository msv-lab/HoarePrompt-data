Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as inputs and returns a new tuple containing the difference of corresponding elements from the two input tuples. 

Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Tuple Input**: The function accepts two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) containing numerical elements.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: It utilizes the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples in parallel and computes the difference of corresponding elements (i.e., subtracts elements of `tup2` from `tup1`).

3. **Returns a Tuple**: The results are returned as a new tuple, matching the expected output format.

4. **Assumptions Validated**: The assumption that both tuples will be of the same length is implicitly handled by the `zip` function, which will stop iterating when the shortest input is reached. The function will return an empty tuple if both inputs are empty, thus it adheres to the behavior laid out in the problem description.

The assertions provided in the annotated code further validate that the function performs as expected with different inputs, demonstrating its correctness under various scenarios outlined in the problem description. Since it satisfies all requirements, the correctness of the program is indeed confirmed.
