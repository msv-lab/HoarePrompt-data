The provided program appears to be designed to subtract elements of two tuples with the same indices. The program uses the `zip` function to pair elements from both tuples, calculates the difference, and returns a new tuple reflecting these differences.

Examining the assertions provided:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))` correctly results in `(8, -1, -13)`.
2. `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))` correctly results in `(-13, -43, -13)`.
3. `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))` correctly returns `(-3, 7, -3)`.

The output hints indicate that the function will return a new tuple, where each element is the result of subtracting corresponding elements in `tup2` from `tup1`. It highlights that:
- The function assumes both tuples are of the same length, and if they are not, a `ValueError` will be raised during the execution of `zip`.
- If either tuple is empty, an empty tuple will be returned.

However, the problem description specifies that both tuples should be of the same length, and considering this assumption, as outlined in the guidance for correctness evaluation, we must assess whether the program properly handles all potential scenarios.

The main potential issue that could arise is when the tuples are of different lengths. In such a case, the function would not be able to subtract correctly, and the program would raise an error. This situation is not explicitly covered in the output hints, so it implies that the program does not correctly handle this case according to the problem description.

Therefore, since the program does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases (specifically regarding tuples of unequal lengths), we must conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
