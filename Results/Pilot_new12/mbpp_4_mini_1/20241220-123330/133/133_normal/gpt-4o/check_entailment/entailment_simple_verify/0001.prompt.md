You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let’s analyze the code and consider possible edge cases.

The function `func_1` is designed to subtract corresponding elements of two tuples. Here’s what it does step by step:

1. It takes in two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`).
2. It uses `zip` to iterate through both tuples element by element.
3. It then subtracts the elements from `tup2` from those in `tup1`.
4. Finally, it returns a new tuple containing the results of these subtractions.

The provided assertions already test the function with three different tuple inputs. However, we should also consider edge cases, such as:

1. **Different Length Tuples**: If `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, `zip` will truncate to the shortest tuple, potentially missing elements from the longer tuple.
   - For example: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would return `(-2, -2)` but wouldn't consider the element `5` in `tup2`, leading to loss of information.
   
2. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, `func_1((), ())` should return `()`, which it does correctly. An input like `func_1((), (1,))`, however, will also lead to `()`.

3. **Non-Numeric Input**: The current implementation does not handle non-numeric inputs. For instance, `func_1((1, 2), (3, 'a'))` would raise a `TypeError` due to attempting to subtract a string from an integer.

Given these considerations, the program has potential cases where it does not meet the requirements:

- It does not handle tuples of different lengths gracefully.
- It does not validate that the elements of the tuples are numeric, which could lead to runtime errors.

Due to these issues, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length containing numerical elements.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the difference of corresponding elements from tuples 'tup1' and 'tup2'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
