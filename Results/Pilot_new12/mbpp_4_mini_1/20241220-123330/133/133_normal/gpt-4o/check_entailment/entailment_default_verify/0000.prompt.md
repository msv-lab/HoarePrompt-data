You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the tuples have different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should subtract corresponding elements by index, which implies that both tuples need to have the same length. However, if the two tuples are of different lengths, the current implementation would still proceed without an error, but it will not produce a meaningful subtraction for the missing indices, which could lead to an unexpected result or a logical error in the intended functionality.

For example:
```python
func_1((10, 4), (2, 5, 18))
```
This would lead to a situation where the first tuple has only two elements, and the second tuple has three elements. The function would only operate on the first two elements of the second tuple, effectively ignoring the third element entirely and returning `(8, -1)` instead of an expected tuple of the same length or an appropriate error indicating the mismatch. Therefore, the implementation as it stands does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which contain numerical elements of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements in `tup2` from `tup1`. The function assumes that both input tuples are of the same length; otherwise, it will raise a `ValueError` during the execution of `zip`. If either tuple is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The output tuple contains the computed differences of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
