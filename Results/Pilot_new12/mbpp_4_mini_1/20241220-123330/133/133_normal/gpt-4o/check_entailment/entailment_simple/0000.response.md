Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. 

Here are the reasons why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Format**: The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as input. These tuples contain numerical elements, which aligns with the assumption stated in the problem description that valid input will always be provided.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function utilizes the `zip` function to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their indices. It then performs the subtraction `a - b` for each pair of elements. This directly corresponds to the requirement to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index.

3. **Return Type**: The output is constructed using the `tuple()` function, which ensures that the result is returned as a tuple, as required.

4. **Validation**: The assertions provided in the program test multiple cases, demonstrating that the function behaves correctly across various scenarios, producing expected results for indexed subtractions.

Given all these points, the program fulfills the objectives of the problem description correctly for the defined constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
