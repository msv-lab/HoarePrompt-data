Based on the problem description, the goal is to write a function that takes two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the corresponding elements of the second tuple. 

The provided program, `func_1`, uses `zip` to pair elements of the two tuples and subtracts the elements as intended, returning a new tuple with the differences.

The original assessment pointed out several shortcomings:
1. The function does not handle tuples of different lengths gracefully.
2. The function does not validate that the elements are numeric, which could lead to runtime errors.

However, the annotated version clarifies that before the function calls, the program is expected to handle valid inputs: both tuples contain numerical elements and are of the same length. The annotations suggest that if the inputs are valid, the function should work correctly under these assumptions. 

Given that we are assuming valid inputs as stipulated, the issue of differing lengths does not apply since we are guaranteed that the inputs will meet this requirement. The original assessment assumed general usage scenarios where invalid inputs might exist.

Taking all of this into account, the function `func_1` does meet the requirements of the problem description under the assumption of valid input. Consequently, the original assessment indicating that the program is incorrect does not hold because it considers possibilities that will not occur if we assume that the function only receives valid inputs as stated.

Final: **True**
