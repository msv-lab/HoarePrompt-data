Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the tuples have different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should subtract corresponding elements by index, which implies that both tuples need to have the same length. However, if the two tuples are of different lengths, the current implementation would still proceed without an error, but it will not produce a meaningful subtraction for the missing indices, which could lead to an unexpected result or a logical error in the intended functionality.

For example:
```python
func_1((10, 4), (2, 5, 18))
```
This would lead to a situation where the first tuple has only two elements, and the second tuple has three elements. The function would only operate on the first two elements of the second tuple, effectively ignoring the third element entirely and returning `(8, -1)` instead of an expected tuple of the same length or an appropriate error indicating the mismatch. Therefore, the implementation as it stands does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
