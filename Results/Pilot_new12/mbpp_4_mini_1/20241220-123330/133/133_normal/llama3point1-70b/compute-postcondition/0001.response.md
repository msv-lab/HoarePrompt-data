The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, containing numerical elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the difference between each corresponding element of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numerical elements of the same length and return a new tuple representing the element-wise differences between the two input tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length containing numerical elements, and returns a tuple of their element-wise differences.**
