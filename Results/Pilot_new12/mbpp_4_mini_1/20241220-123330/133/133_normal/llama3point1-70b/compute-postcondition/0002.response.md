Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be of the same length and contain numerical elements. It calculates the element-wise difference between corresponding elements of the two tuples, resulting in a new tuple that consists of these differences. The function directly returns this resulting tuple. The annotations are accurate in describing this behavior, and there are no apparent missing elements or edge cases in the current logic, assuming that the inputs meet the expected conditions. However, if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will not handle that case, potentially leading to a runtime error. The function effectively performs the operation as intended under the given assumptions.**
