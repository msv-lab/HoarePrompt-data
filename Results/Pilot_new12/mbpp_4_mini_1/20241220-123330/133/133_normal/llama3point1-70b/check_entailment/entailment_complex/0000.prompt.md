You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numerical elements.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the difference between each corresponding element of `tup1` and `tup2`, i.e., (a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be of the same length and contain numerical elements. It calculates the element-wise difference between corresponding elements of the two tuples, resulting in a new tuple that consists of these differences. The function directly returns this resulting tuple. The annotations are accurate in describing this behavior, and there are no apparent missing elements or edge cases in the current logic, assuming that the inputs meet the expected conditions. However, if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will not handle that case, potentially leading to a runtime error. The function effectively performs the operation as intended under the given assumptions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
