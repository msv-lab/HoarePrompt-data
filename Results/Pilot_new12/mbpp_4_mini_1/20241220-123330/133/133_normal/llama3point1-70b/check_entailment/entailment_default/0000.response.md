The program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple, producing a new tuple with the results. 

The output hints indicate that the function is supposed to return a tuple containing the element-wise differences of the two input tuples. However, the hints also highlight a crucial limitation: the function does not handle the case where the tuples are of different lengths. If the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` are of unequal lengths, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to unhandled values in the longer tuple.

For example:
- If `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(-3, -3)` instead of raising an error or indicating that the tuples must be of the same length. This is a failure to meet the requirements of the problem description of subtracting corresponding elements by index, as it does not account for the possibility of differing tuple lengths.

Given this analysis, we conclude that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
