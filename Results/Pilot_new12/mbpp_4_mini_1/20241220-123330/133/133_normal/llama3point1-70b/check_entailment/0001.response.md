Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic of subtracting the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index. It uses `zip` to pair the elements of the two tuples and a generator expression to perform the subtraction for each paired element. Since the problem description is fulfilled for all potential cases, including different lengths of tuples or any type of numeric input (assuming they are compatible for subtraction), there are no edge cases that have been overlooked based on the provided information. 

The function will handle tuples of the same length correctly by subtracting their elements index-wise and will raise an error (IndexError) if the tuples are of different lengths, which does not explicitly violate the problem statement but needs to be noted. However, since the prompt does not specify to handle tuples of different lengths, the implementation aligns with the expectations laid out in the problem description. Thus, it satisfactorily achieves the intended functionality.

Overall, it is safe to conclude that the program is correct as is.
