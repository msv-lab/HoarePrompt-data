Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, it defines a function `func_1` that takes in two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) and computes the element-wise difference between these tuples. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Tuples**: The precondition specifies that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical elements. The code does not explicitly handle any invalid input or perform type checks, but according to the assumptions given, we consider that valid inputs will always be provided.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The program uses the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from both tuples, and then utilizes a generator expression `(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))` to compute the subtraction for each pair `(a, b)` where `a` is an element from `tup1` and `b` is the corresponding element from `tup2`.

3. **Output as Tuple**: The results of the subtractions are collected into a new tuple using the `tuple()` constructor, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to return a tuple.

4. **Correct Behavior**: For any valid input tuples, the function will always return a tuple containing the results of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the first, indexed accordingly. This behavior is in direct compliance with the problem description.

Thus, the function correctly implements the specified requirements, confirming its correctness as per the provided problem description.
