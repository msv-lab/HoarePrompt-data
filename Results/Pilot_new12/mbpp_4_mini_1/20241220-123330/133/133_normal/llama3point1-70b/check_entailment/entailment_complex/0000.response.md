Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples in pairs. The list comprehension generates a new tuple containing the differences between the corresponding elements (`a - b`).

The annotations accurately describe the operation being performed, which is to return a tuple that contains the element-wise differences of the two input tuples. The requirements regarding tuple length and numerical types are mentioned in the comments, and it is explicitly stated that the function will work under the assumption that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and contain numerical values.

Since it is also stated that we can assume input validity, and the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem requirements for the valid input case, the function meets the expectations laid out in the problem description. Therefore, the function is considered correct for the specified assumptions.
