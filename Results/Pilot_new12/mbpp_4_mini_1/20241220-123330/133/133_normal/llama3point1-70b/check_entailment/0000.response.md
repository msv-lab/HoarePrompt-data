To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function against the requirements stated.

**Problem description**: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

The function `func_1` is designed to subtract elements of `tup2` from `tup1` using the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously. It creates a new tuple from the results of the subtraction.

**Testing edge cases**: 
1. If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple. Therefore, any elements in the longer tuple would not be subtracted, which deviates from typical expectations where both tuples might need to be of equal length for element-wise operations.

   For example:
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))  # Expected: (-3, -3, 3), but will return (-3, -3) and ignore the last element in tup1.
   ```

2. If either tuple is empty, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is the intended behavior, but itâ€™s worth noting that there are no calculations performed.

3. If the tuples contain any non-numeric types (like strings), the program will throw a `TypeError` when trying to perform subtraction.

Given the observation that the function does not handle tuples of different lengths and returns incomplete results, and it may fail if given non-numeric values, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not cover all potential cases as outlined in the problem description; specifically handling tuples of unequal length leads to partial results, which is contrary to the intent of performing element-wise subtraction for all indices.
