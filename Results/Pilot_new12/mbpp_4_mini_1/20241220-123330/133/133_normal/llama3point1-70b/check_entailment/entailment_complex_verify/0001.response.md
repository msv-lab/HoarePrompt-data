Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description by correctly implementing the logic to subtract the corresponding elements of the two tuples, assuming they are of the same length. The annotations confirm this behavior, stating that the function calculates the element-wise difference and returns a new tuple consisting of these differences. 

While the function does not handle tuples of different lengths, the problem description does not specify that such scenarios need to be addressed, and it is reasonable to assume that valid input will be provided per the assumptions stated. The annotations specifically note that the state before the function call involves tuples of the same length containing numerical elements, aligning with the requirements of the problem description. 

Overall, as the implementation fulfills the intended functionality given the constraints, the function is correctly assessed as true.
