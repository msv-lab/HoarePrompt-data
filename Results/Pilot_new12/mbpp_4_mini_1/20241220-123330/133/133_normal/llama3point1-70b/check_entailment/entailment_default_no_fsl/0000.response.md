Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) are of different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should subtract corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, if the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only process up to the length of the shorter tuple and ignore any remaining elements in the longer tuple. This leads to incomplete calculations based on the assumption of equal tuple lengths. 

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)` which results in `(-3, -3)`, and it will disregard the value `3` in `tup1`. Thus, there are cases where the program does not meet the full requirements of the problem description.
