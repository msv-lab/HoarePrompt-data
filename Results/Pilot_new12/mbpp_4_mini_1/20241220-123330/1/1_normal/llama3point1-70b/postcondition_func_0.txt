The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple that contains the unique elements common to both lists. If there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function effectively ignores any duplicate entries within either list since it converts them to sets before calculating the intersection. However, the function does not handle scenarios where the input parameters are not lists (such as if they are empty, `None`, or some other type), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
