The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both parameters are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a tuple containing the elements that are common between the lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a tuple of their common elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists and returns a tuple containing the elements that are common between the two lists.**
