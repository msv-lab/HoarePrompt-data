Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (or lists, according to the problem description) as inputs and returns a tuple containing the shared elements. 

Here's why the program seems correct:

1. **Inputs**: The function uses `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)` to convert the input tuples to sets, which allows the use of the intersection operator `&` to find common elements efficiently.
2. **Returns**: The intersection operation ensures that only the elements present in both input sets are included in the result.
3. **Output Type**: The output is converted back into a tuple, as specified in the function, which meets the requirement of the problem description.

The program handles basic scenarios such as:
- When both lists are empty, the output will be an empty tuple `()`.
- When there are no common elements, the output will also be `()`.
- It handles cases where:
  - One list is empty.
  - Both lists contain duplicate elements (the use of sets will take care of this).
  - All elements are shared between two lists.

Since I can't identify any input cases where the program fails, I determine that the implementation is correct. Hence, Correctness is **True**.
