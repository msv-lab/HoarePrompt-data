You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Functionality**: The function attempts to find common elements between two input lists (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`). It does this by converting both lists to sets, using the intersection operator `&`, and then returning the result as a tuple.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
    - Given two lists, the output should be a tuple containing the elements that are present in both lists.
    - The result should include shared elements without any duplicates and in no specific order since sets do not maintain order.

3. **Edge Cases** to consider:
    - If one or both input lists are empty (`test_tup1 = []` and/or `test_tup2 = []`), the expected output should be an empty tuple `()`.
    - If there are no shared elements between the two lists, the output should also be an empty tuple `()`.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Case with no common elements**: 
  - `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` should return `()` and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([1, 2, 3]) & set([4, 5, 6]))  # results in ()
    ```
  
- **Case with one empty list**:
  - `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` should return `()`, and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([]) & set([1, 2, 3]))  # results in ()
    ```

- **Case with both lists empty**:
  - `func_1([], [])` should return `()`, and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([]) & set([]))  # results in ()
    ```

Thus, after testing for these various edge cases, it seems that the code functions correctly in all the tested scenarios. 

### Conclusion:

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description without failing in any example or edge case, we conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements that are common between the lists 'test_tup1' and 'test_tup2'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
