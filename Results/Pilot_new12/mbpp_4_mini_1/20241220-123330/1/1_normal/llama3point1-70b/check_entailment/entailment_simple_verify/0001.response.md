Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness as **True** is accurate based on the problem description and the annotations provided. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between the two lists (or tuples) by leveraging set operations, which is an efficient means to compute intersections. The annotations clarify that the function returns a tuple of common elements, confirming compliance with the problem requirements.

Moreover, the annotations state that before the function call, both inputs are explicitly described as lists. Given the assumption that inputs will always be valid, the function's behavior remains predictable and reliable in all specified scenarios.

Thus, all considerations point to the conclusion that the program meets its intended purpose as outlined in the problem description, hence maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
