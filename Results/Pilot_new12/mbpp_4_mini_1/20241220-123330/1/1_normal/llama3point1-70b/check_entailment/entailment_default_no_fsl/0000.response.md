Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle scenarios where the input parameters are not lists, such as if they are `None` or some other type, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if the function is called with `func_1(None, [1, 2, 3])`, it will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert `None` to a set. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
