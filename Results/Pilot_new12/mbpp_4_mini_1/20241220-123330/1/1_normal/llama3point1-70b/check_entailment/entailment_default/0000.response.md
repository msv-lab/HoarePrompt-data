Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function is intended to return the shared elements from two lists, and it uses sets to achieve this, which works correctly for the presence of common elements. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle scenarios in which the input parameters are not lists, such as if they are empty, `None`, or some other type. For example, calling `func_1(None, [1, 2, 3])` would raise a TypeError, as `None` cannot be converted to a set. Therefore, since the program does not handle all potential cases as described, it is deemed incorrect.
