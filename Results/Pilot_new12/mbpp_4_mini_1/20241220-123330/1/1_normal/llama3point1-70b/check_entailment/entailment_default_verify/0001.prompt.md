You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (or lists, according to the problem description) as inputs and returns a tuple containing the shared elements. 

Here's why the program seems correct:

1. **Inputs**: The function uses `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)` to convert the input tuples to sets, which allows the use of the intersection operator `&` to find common elements efficiently.
2. **Returns**: The intersection operation ensures that only the elements present in both input sets are included in the result.
3. **Output Type**: The output is converted back into a tuple, as specified in the function, which meets the requirement of the problem description.

The program handles basic scenarios such as:
- When both lists are empty, the output will be an empty tuple `()`.
- When there are no common elements, the output will also be `()`.
- It handles cases where:
  - One list is empty.
  - Both lists contain duplicate elements (the use of sets will take care of this).
  - All elements are shared between two lists.

Since I can't identify any input cases where the program fails, I determine that the implementation is correct. Hence, Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple that contains the unique elements common to both lists. If there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function effectively ignores any duplicate entries within either list since it converts them to sets before calculating the intersection. However, the function does not handle scenarios where the input parameters are not lists (such as if they are empty, `None`, or some other type), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
