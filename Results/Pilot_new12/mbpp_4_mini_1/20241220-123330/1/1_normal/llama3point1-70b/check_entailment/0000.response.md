To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Functionality**: The function attempts to find common elements between two input lists (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`). It does this by converting both lists to sets, using the intersection operator `&`, and then returning the result as a tuple.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
    - Given two lists, the output should be a tuple containing the elements that are present in both lists.
    - The result should include shared elements without any duplicates and in no specific order since sets do not maintain order.

3. **Edge Cases** to consider:
    - If one or both input lists are empty (`test_tup1 = []` and/or `test_tup2 = []`), the expected output should be an empty tuple `()`.
    - If there are no shared elements between the two lists, the output should also be an empty tuple `()`.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Case with no common elements**: 
  - `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` should return `()` and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([1, 2, 3]) & set([4, 5, 6]))  # results in ()
    ```
  
- **Case with one empty list**:
  - `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])` should return `()`, and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([]) & set([1, 2, 3]))  # results in ()
    ```

- **Case with both lists empty**:
  - `func_1([], [])` should return `()`, and it does:
    ```python
    return tuple(set([]) & set([]))  # results in ()
    ```

Thus, after testing for these various edge cases, it seems that the code functions correctly in all the tested scenarios. 

### Conclusion:

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description without failing in any example or edge case, we conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
