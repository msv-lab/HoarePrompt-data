Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the problem description specifies that the function should return the shared elements from two lists. However, the program is returning the shared elements as a tuple, which is not what the problem statement requires. The problem description implies that the shared elements should be returned in a list format. Therefore, the expected output type does not match the provided output type in the annotated program. 

To be correct, the function should return the common elements in a list instead of a tuple.
