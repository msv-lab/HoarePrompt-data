Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the shared elements from two lists as a tuple, effectively handling edge cases such as empty lists or no common elements. The annotations support this finding by confirming that the function behaves as expected and clarifying that the input is assumed to be valid. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the task, and the assessment remains justified.
