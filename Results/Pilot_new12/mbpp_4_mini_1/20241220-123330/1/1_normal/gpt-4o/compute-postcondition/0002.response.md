The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the sorted elements that are common to both `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists and return a tuple of sorted common elements found in both lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a tuple containing the sorted elements that are common to both lists.**
