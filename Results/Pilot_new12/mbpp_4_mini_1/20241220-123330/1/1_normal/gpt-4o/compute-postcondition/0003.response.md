Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the common elements between them. It returns a tuple containing these common elements sorted in ascending order. If either list is empty or if there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function uses the intersection operation on sets to find common elements, which ensures that duplicates are removed. Additionally, the final output is a sorted tuple, making the result predictable and ordered, regardless of the order of elements in the input lists.**
