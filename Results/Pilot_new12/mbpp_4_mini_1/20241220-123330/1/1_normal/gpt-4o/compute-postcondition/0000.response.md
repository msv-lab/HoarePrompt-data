The variable `common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection of `list1` and `list2`, which is the set of elements that are present in both lists. The states of the other variables `list1` and `list2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a list containing elements, `list2` is a list containing elements, and `common_elements` is the set of elements that are in both `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements, `list2` is a list containing elements, `common_elements` is the set of elements that are in both `list1` and `list2`.**
