You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements from the two given lists. It converts both lists to sets, uses the set intersection operation to find the common elements, and then returns them as a sorted tuple. 

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness:
1. `func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))` correctly returns `(4, 5)`.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7))` correctly returns `(3, 4)`.
3. `func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13))` correctly returns `(13, 14)`.

Additionally, the function will handle edge cases correctly, such as:
- If there are no shared elements, it will return an empty tuple `()`.
- If either list is empty, it correctly returns an empty tuple `()`.
- The function properly handles duplicates within lists, as sets automatically handle them.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet its requirements based on the problem description, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the common elements between them. It returns a tuple containing these common elements sorted in ascending order. If either list is empty or if there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function uses the intersection operation on sets to find common elements, which ensures that duplicates are removed. Additionally, the final output is a sorted tuple, making the result predictable and ordered, regardless of the order of elements in the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
