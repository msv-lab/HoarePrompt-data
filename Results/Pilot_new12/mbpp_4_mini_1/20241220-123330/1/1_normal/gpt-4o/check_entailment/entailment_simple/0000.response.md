Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description by correctly identifying the shared elements from two given lists. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two lists (or tuples, which are convertible to sets) as input parameters. It uses the `set` data structure to find the common elements between the two lists. This is achieved through the intersection operator `&`, which efficiently retrieves the shared elements.

2. **Output Format**: The common elements are then converted back into a sorted tuple, which is the required output format as stipulated by the problem description.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with various pairs of input lists, ensuring that it returns the correct shared elements for all cases presented, which confirms that the function behaves as intended.

The program performs the required functionality of finding shared elements and returns them in the specified format, thus aligning with the problem description. Therefore, it is correct and fulfills the task as described.
