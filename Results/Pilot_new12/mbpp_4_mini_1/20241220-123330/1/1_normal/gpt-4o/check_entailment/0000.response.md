Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements from the two given lists. It converts both lists to sets, uses the set intersection operation to find the common elements, and then returns them as a sorted tuple. 

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness:
1. `func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))` correctly returns `(4, 5)`.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7))` correctly returns `(3, 4)`.
3. `func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13))` correctly returns `(13, 14)`.

Additionally, the function will handle edge cases correctly, such as:
- If there are no shared elements, it will return an empty tuple `()`.
- If either list is empty, it correctly returns an empty tuple `()`.
- The function properly handles duplicates within lists, as sets automatically handle them.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet its requirements based on the problem description, the function is correct.
