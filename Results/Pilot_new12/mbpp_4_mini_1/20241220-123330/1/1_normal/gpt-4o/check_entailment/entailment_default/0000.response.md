The provided program correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists. It utilizes the intersection operation on sets, which eliminates duplicates and allows for an efficient comparison. 

The function `func_1` is tested with three assertions that check for common elements between two given lists. The output hints clarify that the function handles the case of empty lists or lists with no common elements by returning an empty tuple, as the intersection of sets would yield no results in those cases. It also mentions that the output is returned as a sorted tuple, which ensures predictability in results.

From the examination of the code, the function behaves correctly for the cases provided in the problem description and the output hints align with the operation being performed.

Furthermore, invalid input cases such as passing in non-list types are assumed to be valid based on the task guidelines. Given that the program follows the requirements correctly for the valid scenarios stated and there aren't any apparent handling issues, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
