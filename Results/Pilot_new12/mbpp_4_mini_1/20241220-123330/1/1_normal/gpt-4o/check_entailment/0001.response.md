To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description of finding shared elements from two lists, we need to evaluate the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Function Analysis

The function `func_1` is implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
```

1. **Finding Common Elements**: 
   - The sets created from the lists will only contain unique elements, which means that if there are duplicates in either list, they won't affect the result.
   - The use of the `&` operator finds the intersection of both sets, which effectively identifies all unique elements present in both lists.

2. **Returning as Tuple**: 
   - The result is converted to a sorted tuple, ensuring that the output is ordered.

### Checks for Correctness

To confirm the correctness, we can consider:
- The provided assertions indicate expected results for specific input cases.
- There is also a need to account for other edge cases, such as:
  - **Empty Lists**: 
    - Both lists being empty should return an empty tuple: `func_1((), ())` should give `()`.
  - **No Common Elements**: 
    - For two lists that have no common elements, e.g., `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))`, it should return an empty tuple `()`.
  - **Handling Duplicates**:
    - If one list has duplicates and the other does not, e.g., `func_1((1, 1, 2), (1, 3))`, it should correctly return `(1,)`, since the common element is only `1`.

### Various Test Cases

1. Testing for empty lists:
    ```python
    assert func_1((), ()) == ()  # Correct
    ```
2. Testing for no shared elements:
    ```python
    assert func_1((1, 2), (3, 4)) == ()  # Correct
    ```
3. Testing for duplicates:
    ```python
    assert func_1((1, 1, 2), (1, 3)) == (1,)  # Correct
    ```
4. Testing with one empty list:
    ```python
    assert func_1((1, 2), ()) == ()  # Correct
    ```

### Conclusion

Since the implementation correctly handles the finding of shared elements between two lists, including all described edge cases and scenarios, we conclude the program is correctly implemented as per the problem description.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
