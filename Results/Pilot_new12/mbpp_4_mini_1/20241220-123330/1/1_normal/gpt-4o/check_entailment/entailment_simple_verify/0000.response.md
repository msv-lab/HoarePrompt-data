Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the requirements set by the problem description, which is to find shared elements in two lists. The annotations confirm that `list1` and `list2` contain valid elements before the function call, and the function correctly identifies the common elements by utilizing set intersection. The resulting tuple is also sorted, as stated in the requirements.

All assertions provided in the code return the expected results, validating the correctness of the function. Furthermore, the function handles edge cases such as empty lists and duplicate values effectively, adhering to expected behavior.

Because the program successfully meets the problem criteria and the annotations reinforce the function's correctness, the final assessment remains: Final: **True**.
