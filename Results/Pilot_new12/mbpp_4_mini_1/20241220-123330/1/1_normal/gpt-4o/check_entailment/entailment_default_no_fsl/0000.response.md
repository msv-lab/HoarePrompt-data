Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It accurately identifies shared elements between two input lists by converting both lists to sets, performing an intersection to find common elements, and then sorting these elements before returning them as a tuple.

1. **Common Elements**: The assertions provided in the code verify that it finds common elements as expected for multiple test cases.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: According to the output hints, the function also correctly handles the cases where either of the input lists is empty or when there are no common elements, returning an empty tuple in these situations.

3. **Sorting and Tuple Return**: The final result is returned as a sorted tuple, ensuring that the order of elements is consistent regardless of the order in the input lists.

Since all potential cases described in the problem statement and output hints are handled correctly, the implementation is verified to be correct.

In conclusion, the program meets the requirements for all valid inputs as per the problem description and demonstrates the expected behavior for provided examples and edge cases.
