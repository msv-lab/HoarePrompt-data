Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately concludes that the function `func_1` correctly identifies shared elements from two lists. The provided assertions consistently demonstrate that the function produces the expected outputs for different sets of input lists, confirming its correctness.

The annotated version reinforces this assessment, clearly stating that the function computes the intersection of two lists, returns the common elements as a sorted tuple, and handles potential edge cases, such as empty lists and duplicates.

Both the original assessment and the annotations indicate that all requirements outlined in the problem description are satisfied, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
