Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements from the two given lists, as demonstrated by the assertions provided. The program uses set intersection to find common elements, returning them as a sorted tuple. The output hints further confirm the program's behavior: it accurately addresses common scenarios such as handling empty lists and ensuring that duplicates are removed. Overall, the function meets the problem description requirements, and no evidence suggests that it fails in any described scenario, supporting the conclusion that it is correct.
