Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition:** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both expected to be lists (or tuples, since the test cases use tuples). The problem description states that the function should find the shared (common) elements from the two provided lists.

2. **Finding Common Elements:** The program uses the set intersection operator (`&`) to determine the common elements between `list1` and `list2`. This operation inherently removes duplicates and efficiently finds the overlapping items.

3. **Returning a Tuple of Sorted Elements:** The common elements are then converted to a tuple and sorted using `sorted()`. This ensures that the output is in ascending order, as specified in the explanation of the function. If there are no common elements, the intersection will yield an empty set, and the output will correctly be an empty tuple.

4. **Correct Outputs:** The provided assertions test various cases:
   - `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)` yield `(4, 5)`.
   - `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)` yield `(3, 4)`.
   - `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)` yield `(13, 14)`.
   All outputs correctly reflect the common elements as specified in the problem description.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The function will return an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either of the input lists is empty (due to the properties of set intersection).

Thus, the program meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description and handles the expected cases appropriately.
