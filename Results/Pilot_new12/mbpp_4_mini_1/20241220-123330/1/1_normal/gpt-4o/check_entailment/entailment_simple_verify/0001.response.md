Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the analysis of the code implementation. The function `func_1` correctly identifies shared elements between two lists by utilizing set intersection and returns the result as a sorted tuple. The explicit assertions demonstrate that the function produces the expected outputs for various input cases, confirming its correctness.

Additionally, the annotated version of the code reinforces this assessment by clearly stating the behavior of the program before and after the function call, indicating that it returns the expected common elements. Since all expected edge cases are handled correctly, including duplicate elements and empty lists, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the conclusion remains that the program is correct, and the final assessment is maintained as **True**.
