Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately implements the required logic to find shared elements from two lists by leveraging set operations to compute their intersection. The annotated version reinforces this understanding and provides clarity on the program's behavior at various stages. 

The program returns a sorted tuple of the common elements, handling cases such as empty input lists, presence of duplicates, and lists without common elements appropriately â€” all of which align with the problem description. Since both the reasoning from the original assessment and the state described in the annotated version consistently support the correctness of the implementation, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
