#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists containing elements.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sorted elements that are common to both 'list1' and 'list2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the common elements between them. It returns a tuple containing these common elements sorted in ascending order. If either list is empty or if there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function uses the intersection operation on sets to find common elements, which ensures that duplicates are removed. Additionally, the final output is a sorted tuple, making the result predictable and ordered, regardless of the order of elements in the input lists.
