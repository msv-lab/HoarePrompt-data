The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input parameters. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This operation is performed for all pairs of elements from both tuples, assuming they have the same length. If the tuples are empty, the function still returns an empty tuple. There are no specified edge cases beyond ensuring the tuples are of the same length, and the function handles this requirement internally.
