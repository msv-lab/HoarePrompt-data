Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction, which aligns with the problem description. All the provided test cases also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and the implementation appears to handle the general case correctly, there is no identified issue or edge case that the code does not handle.
