Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices. The output hints confirm that the function handles the general case correctly, performing subtraction for all pairs of elements from both tuples, assuming they have the same length. Additionally, the function returns an empty tuple if the input tuples are empty, which is a valid and expected behavior. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the provided code or output hints that would invalidate the original assessment.
