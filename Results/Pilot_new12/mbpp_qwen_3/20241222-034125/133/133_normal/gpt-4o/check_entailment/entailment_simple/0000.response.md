Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of the second tuple from the first tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements from the two tuples, using the `zip` function to iterate over them simultaneously. 

Given the assertions provided:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)` is true because \(10-2=8\), \(4-5=-1\), and \(5-18=-13\).
2. `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)` is true because \(11-24=-13\), \(2-45=-43\), and \(3-16=-13\).
3. `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)` is true because \(7-10=-3\), \(18-11=7\), and \(9-12=-3\).

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement and all test cases pass, the program is correct.
