Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly performs the subtraction of the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. The annotated version clearly indicates that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`, which aligns with the problem description. All provided test cases also confirm the correct behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
