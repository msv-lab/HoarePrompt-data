Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input parameters. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor, which iterates over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` and performs the subtraction.

The program meets the following criteria:
1. It accepts two tuples as input.
2. It performs the subtraction of corresponding elements from the two tuples.
3. It returns a tuple containing the results of these subtractions.

The provided assertions also validate that the function works correctly for different inputs, ensuring that the implementation adheres to the problem description in all tested scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
