Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The use of `zip` ensures that the operation is performed element-wise, and the function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the resulting tuple. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected for tuples of different lengths and values. Since the function handles the operation correctly for all given examples and the problem description does not specify any additional edge cases, the code is correct for every potential case.
