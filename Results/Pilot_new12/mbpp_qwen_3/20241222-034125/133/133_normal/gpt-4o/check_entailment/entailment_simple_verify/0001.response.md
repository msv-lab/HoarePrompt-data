Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, indicating that the function operates as intended. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves correctly. Since the function works as expected for the given examples and the implementation handles the general case correctly, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is justified.
