Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The annotated version clarifies that the function handles tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple with the results of these subtractions. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function under different inputs. Since the program does not introduce any logical errors or fail to meet the problem description, the original assessment remains valid.
