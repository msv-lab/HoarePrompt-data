Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines the function `func_1` which takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements from the input tuples. The assertions provided in the code also demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the function handles tuples of the same length and produces the expected results, it appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case within the given constraints.
