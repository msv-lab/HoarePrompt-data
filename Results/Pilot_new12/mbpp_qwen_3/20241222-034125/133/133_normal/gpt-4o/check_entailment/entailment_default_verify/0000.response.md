Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and performs the subtraction. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The output hints also accurately describe the function's behavior, including handling cases where the tuples are of the same length and returning an empty tuple if the input tuples are empty. Since the function meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
