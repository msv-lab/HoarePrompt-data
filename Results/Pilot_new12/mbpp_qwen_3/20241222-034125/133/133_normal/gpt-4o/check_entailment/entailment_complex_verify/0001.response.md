Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly performs the operation of subtracting corresponding elements of two tuples. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program and the functionality of the function. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as intended for the given test cases and the problem description. The function handles tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple with the results of the subtraction. There are no issues or edge cases that the provided code does not handle, given the assumption that inputs are valid. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
