Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length containing numeric values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the code does not include any check for tuple length mismatch. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.**
