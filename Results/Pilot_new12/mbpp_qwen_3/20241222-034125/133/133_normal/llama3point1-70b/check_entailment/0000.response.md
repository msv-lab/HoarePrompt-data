Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the corresponding elements of two tuples. Given the problem description, this function performs the required operation for any two tuples of the same length. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided description.
