Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by subtracting the corresponding elements of two tuples. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over pairs of elements from both tuples using `zip` and applies the subtraction operation, resulting in a new tuple with the differences. Since the input tuples are assumed to be of the same length and contain numeric values, the function behaves as expected, making the original assessment correct.
