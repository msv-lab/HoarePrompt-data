Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The annotated version confirms that the function processes two tuples of the same length containing numeric values and returns a new tuple with the results of the subtraction. Although the annotated version mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples have different lengths, the original problem description does not specify handling cases where the input tuples might have different lengths. Therefore, the function correctly meets the described requirements under the assumption that the inputs are valid and of the same length.
