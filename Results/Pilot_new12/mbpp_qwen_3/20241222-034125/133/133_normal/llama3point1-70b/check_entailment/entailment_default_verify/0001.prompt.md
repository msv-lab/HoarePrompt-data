You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. Given the problem description, this implementation works for any two tuples of the same length. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction, which ensures that the result is returned as a tuple.

Since the function handles the described operation correctly for any input where both tuples have the same length, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length containing numeric values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the code does not include any check for tuple length mismatch. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
