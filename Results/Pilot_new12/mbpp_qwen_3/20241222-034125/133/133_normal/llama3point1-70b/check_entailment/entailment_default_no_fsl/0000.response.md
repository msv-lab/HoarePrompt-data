Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior by taking two tuples of the same length and returning a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function also raises a `ValueError` when the tuples have different lengths, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the problem description specifies that the tuples should be of the same length, the function correctly handles this requirement without any missing logic or edge cases.
