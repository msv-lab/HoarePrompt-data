Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation as required. Although the function does not include a check for tuple length mismatch, the original assessment does not mention this as a requirement, and the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle different tuple lengths. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
