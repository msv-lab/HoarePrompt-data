Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insight into the program's behavior, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly performs element-wise subtraction between two tuples of the same length. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor, ensuring that the result is a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the input tuples. Given the problem description and the annotated version, the program meets the required specifications without any issues.
