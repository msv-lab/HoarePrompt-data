Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. Given the problem description, this implementation works for any two tuples of the same length. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction, which ensures that the result is returned as a tuple.

Since the function handles the described operation correctly for any input where both tuples have the same length, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
