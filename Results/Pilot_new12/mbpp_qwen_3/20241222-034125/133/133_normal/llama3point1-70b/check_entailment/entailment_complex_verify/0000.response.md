Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` does correctly perform the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples of the same length, the original assessment did not account for the fact that the function does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths. As stated in the annotated version, if the tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the code does not include any check for tuple length mismatch. Since the problem description does not specify that the function should only operate on tuples of the same length, the function is incomplete and does not fully meet the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate, and the final assessment is **False**.
