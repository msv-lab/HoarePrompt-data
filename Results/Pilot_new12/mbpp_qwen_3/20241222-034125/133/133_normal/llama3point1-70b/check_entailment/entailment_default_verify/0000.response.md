Final: **False**

Reasoning: While the provided function `func_1` appears to correctly perform the subtraction operation for tuples of the same length, the original assessment did not consider the scenario where the input tuples may have different lengths. The output hints clarify that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples do not have the same length. Since the problem description does not specify how the function should handle tuples of different lengths, the function is incomplete and potentially incorrect without handling this case. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate given the provided information.
