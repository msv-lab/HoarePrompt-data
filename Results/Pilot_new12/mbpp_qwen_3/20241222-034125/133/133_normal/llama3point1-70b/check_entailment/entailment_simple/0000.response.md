Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as inputs, which are assumed to be of the same length and containing numeric values. The function then uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. 

Since the problem description specifies that the function should subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple at the same indices, the program directly achieves this by using `zip(tup1, tup2)` to pair elements and the generator expression `a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)` to perform the subtraction.

Therefore, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid cases.
