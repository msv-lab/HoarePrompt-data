Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input, which are assumed to be of the same length and containing numeric values. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to perform element-wise subtraction, resulting in a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.

The problem description requires the function to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple at the same index. The function `func_1` accomplishes this exactly by using the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and performing the subtraction operation.

While the provided code does not explicitly handle the case where the tuples have different lengths (it would raise a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError`), the problem description did not specify how to handle such cases, and the assumption is that valid inputs will be provided. Therefore, the function adheres to the problem description under the given assumptions.
