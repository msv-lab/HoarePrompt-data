Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously and performs the subtraction using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of the same length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. Additionally, the code raises a `ValueError` if the tuples have different lengths, which aligns with the problem description that assumes valid inputs. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement.
