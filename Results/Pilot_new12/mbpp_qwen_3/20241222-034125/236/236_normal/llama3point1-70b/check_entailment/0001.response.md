Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach works for all potential cases:

- If the list is already sorted, `sorted(nums)` will produce the same list, so the comparison will be true.
- If the list is not sorted, `sorted(nums)` will produce a new sorted list, and the comparison will be false.

Since the function behaves as expected for both sorted and unsorted lists, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
