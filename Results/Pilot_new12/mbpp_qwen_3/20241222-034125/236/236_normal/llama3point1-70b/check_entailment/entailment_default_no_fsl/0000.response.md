Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a list is sorted in ascending order by comparing the original list to its sorted version. The function works correctly for all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are identical. The function returns `True` for these cases as expected, indicating that the list is considered sorted. Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
