Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a list is sorted by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles various edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are identical, all of which should return `True`. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided output hints support this, the original assessment is correct.
