You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this approach is incorrect because it only verifies if the list is already sorted in ascending order, but does not check if it is sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. For instance, consider the following list:

```
nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

This list is sorted in descending order, but the function will return `False` because it checks if the original list is equal to its sorted version in ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of checking whether a specified list is sorted in any order, and hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #`The program returns True if the list 'nums' is already sorted, otherwise returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list. It checks if the list is sorted by comparing each element with the next one to ensure they are in non-decreasing order. Potential edge cases include an empty list (`[]`), a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are identical. The function correctly handles these cases by returning `True` for an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are the same.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
