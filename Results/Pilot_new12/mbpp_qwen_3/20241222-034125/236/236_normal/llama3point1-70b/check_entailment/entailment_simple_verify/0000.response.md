Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks if the list `nums` is already sorted by comparing it to its sorted version in ascending order. This approach does not account for lists that are sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. The annotated explanation clearly states that the function returns `True` if the list is already sorted (in ascending order), which aligns with the original assessment. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of checking whether a specified list is sorted in any order, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
