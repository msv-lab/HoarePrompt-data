Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version. The annotations state that the function returns `True` if the list is already sorted and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires a function to check if a specified list is sorted. Since the function behaves as intended for all valid inputs, the original assessment is accurate.
