Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. The annotations confirm that the function works as intended for all potential cases:

- An empty list returns `True`.
- A list with a single element returns `True`.
- A list where all elements are identical returns `True`.
- A list that is already sorted returns `True`.
- A list that is not sorted returns `False`.

The function does not modify the input list and correctly handles all edge cases mentioned. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
