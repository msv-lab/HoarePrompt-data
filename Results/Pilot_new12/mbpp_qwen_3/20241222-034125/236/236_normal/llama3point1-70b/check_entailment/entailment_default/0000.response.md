Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. The function `func_1` compares the original list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If both lists are identical, it means the original list was already sorted in ascending order, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The code handles all potential edge cases:
- An empty list `[]` will return `True` because an empty list is considered sorted.
- A list with a single element will also return `True` because a single-element list is trivially sorted.
- A list where all elements are identical will return `True` because such a list is sorted.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code behaves as expected for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
