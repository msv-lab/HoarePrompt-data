Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks whether the list `nums` is sorted or not. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted(nums)` function. If both lists are identical, it means the original list was already sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach works for any list of comparable elements, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
