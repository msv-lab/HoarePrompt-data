Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this approach is incorrect because it only verifies if the list is already sorted in ascending order, but does not check if it is sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. For instance, consider the following list:

```
nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

This list is sorted in descending order, but the function will return `False` because it checks if the original list is equal to its sorted version in ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of checking whether a specified list is sorted in any order, and hence it is incorrect.
