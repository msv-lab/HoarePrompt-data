Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach does not account for lists that are sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. The function will return `False` for a list that is sorted in descending order or any other non-ascending order, which contradicts the problem description requiring a function to check if a specified list is sorted in any order. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and remains incorrect.
