Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach does not account for lists that are sorted in descending order or any other custom sorting order. The output hints confirm that the function only checks for ascending order, which means it does not meet the requirement of verifying if a specified list is sorted in any order. Therefore, the program is still incorrect according to the problem description.
