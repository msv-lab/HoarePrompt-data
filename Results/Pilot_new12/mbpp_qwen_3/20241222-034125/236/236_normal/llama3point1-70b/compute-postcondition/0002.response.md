Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list. It checks if the list is sorted by comparing each element with the next one to ensure they are in non-decreasing order. Potential edge cases include an empty list (`[]`), a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are identical. The function correctly handles these cases by returning `True` for an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list where all elements are the same.**
