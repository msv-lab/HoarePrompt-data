According to the given information, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the list `lst` has at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since the list has at least 3 elements, `i + 1` (which is 2) is within the bounds of the list. 

The precondition that `lst[1]` is less than or equal to `lst[2]` ensures that the function will not return False immediately upon entering the loop for the first time. Therefore, we do not need to change the state of `lst` since the precondition guarantees that `lst[1]` is less than or equal to `lst[2]`.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
