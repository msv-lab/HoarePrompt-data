Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If `lst[i]` (which is `lst[1]`) is greater than `lst[i + 1]` (which is `lst[2]`), the function returns False. Otherwise, no change is made and the function continues execution with the original values of `lst` and `i`. Given the precondition that `lst[1]` is less than or equal to `lst[2]`, the function will always return False.***
