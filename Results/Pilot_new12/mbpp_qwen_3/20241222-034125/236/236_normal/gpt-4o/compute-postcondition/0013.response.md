Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the function encounters any element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. There are three cases where the function returns `False` (when the loop finds an element greater than the next one at any point), and one case where the function returns `True` (when the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements).**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where the list is empty, as the loop will not execute and the function will implicitly return `True` (since an empty list is considered sorted).
- The function correctly handles lists with a single element, as the loop will also not execute and the function will implicitly return `True`.
- The function correctly handles lists that are already sorted in non-decreasing order, as it will pass through the entire list without returning `False`.
