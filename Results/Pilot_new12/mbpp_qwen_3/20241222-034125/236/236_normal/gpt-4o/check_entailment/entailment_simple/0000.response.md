Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats).

2. **Loop Logic**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list from the first element to the second last element. For each pair of consecutive elements `(lst[i], lst[i + 1])`, it checks if the current element is greater than the next element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`). If this condition is true for any pair, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding any unsorted pairs, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases validate the function's behavior:
   - The first test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True` because all elements are in non-decreasing order.
   - The second test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False` because the element `20` is out of order.
   - The third test case with `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` also returns `False` because the element `15` followed by `14` is out of order.

The program adheres to the problem description by correctly checking whether the list is sorted and providing the appropriate output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
