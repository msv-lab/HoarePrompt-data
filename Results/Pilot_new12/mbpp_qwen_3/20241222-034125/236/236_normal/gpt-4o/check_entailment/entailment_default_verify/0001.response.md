Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including a fully sorted list, a list with an out-of-order element, and a list with a duplicate and an out-of-order element. The function returns `False` when it encounters any element that is greater than the next one and `True` otherwise. Given that the provided output hints and the behavior of the function align with the problem description and test cases, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
