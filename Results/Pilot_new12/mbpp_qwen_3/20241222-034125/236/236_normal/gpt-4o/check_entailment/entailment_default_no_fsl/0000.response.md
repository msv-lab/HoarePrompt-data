Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such elements, it returns `True`.

The output hints indicate that the function correctly identifies when a list is not sorted by checking each adjacent pair of elements. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True`.
- A list with a descending element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False`.
- A list with an earlier out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False`.

Since the code behaves as expected for the provided test cases and the problem description, and there are no additional edge cases mentioned in the output hints that the code does not handle, the code appears to be correct.
