Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not.
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The function iterates through the list using a for loop, comparing each element with the next one.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
   - If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.
3. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` should return `True` because the list is sorted).
   - `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` should return `False` because the element `20` is greater than `17`.
   - `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` should also return `False` because the element `15` is greater than `14`.

These test cases align with the function's behavior and demonstrate that it correctly identifies both sorted and unsorted lists.

Therefore, the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
