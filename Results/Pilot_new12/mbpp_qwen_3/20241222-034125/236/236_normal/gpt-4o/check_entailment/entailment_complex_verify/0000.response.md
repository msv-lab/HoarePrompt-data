Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` because the list is sorted.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted.

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
