You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, if no such pair is found, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover several scenarios:
1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True`.
2. A list with an out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False`.
3. A list with a duplicate and an out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False`.

These test cases cover both correct and incorrect sorting scenarios. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements that is sorted in non-decreasing order if the loop does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the function encounters any element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. There are three cases where the function returns `False` (when the loop finds an element greater than the next one at any point), and one case where the function returns `True` (when the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
