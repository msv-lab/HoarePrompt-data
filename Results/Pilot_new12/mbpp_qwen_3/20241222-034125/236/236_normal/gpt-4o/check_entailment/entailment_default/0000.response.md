Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such element, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A completely sorted list: `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True`
2. A list that is not sorted due to an out-of-order element in the middle: `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False`
3. A list that is not sorted due to an out-of-order element towards the end: `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False`

Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases, and the problem description matches the implementation, the code is correct for every potential case.
