Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, if no such pair is found, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover several scenarios:
1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True`.
2. A list with an out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False`.
3. A list with a duplicate and an out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False`.

These test cases cover both correct and incorrect sorting scenarios. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
