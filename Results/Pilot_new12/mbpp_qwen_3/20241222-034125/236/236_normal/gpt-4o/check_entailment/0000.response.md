Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` because the list is sorted.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` because the list is not sorted.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic seems sound, there are no apparent issues that would make the program incorrect.
