#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements that is sorted in non-decreasing order if the loop does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the function encounters any element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. There are three cases where the function returns `False` (when the loop finds an element greater than the next one at any point), and one case where the function returns `True` (when the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements).
