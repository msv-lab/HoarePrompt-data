The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the function encounters any element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. There are three cases where the function returns `False` (when the loop finds an element greater than the next one at any point), and one case where the function returns `True` (when the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements).
