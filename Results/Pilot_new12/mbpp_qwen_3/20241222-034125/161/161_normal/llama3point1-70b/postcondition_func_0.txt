The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns either 2, 1, or the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2 based on the value of `n`. Specifically:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- For any other value of `n`, the function computes the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n+1`-th term and returns the 7th Fibonacci number in the sequence (starting from index 2).

This covers all possible inputs for `n` and ensures that the function behaves as specified in the return postconditions.
