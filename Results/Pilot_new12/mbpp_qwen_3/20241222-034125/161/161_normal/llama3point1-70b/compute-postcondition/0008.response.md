The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. After executing the code, `a` takes the value of `b`, which is 1, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`, which is `2 + 1` or 3. The value of `n` remains greater than 2 as it was unaffected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
