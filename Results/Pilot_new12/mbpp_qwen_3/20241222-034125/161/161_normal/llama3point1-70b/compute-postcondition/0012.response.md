The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b` and updates `a` to be the sum of its original value and `b`. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4, the code will perform the following operations:

1. Swap `a` and `b`: After this operation, the new value of `a` will be the original value of `b`, which is 4.
2. Update `a` to be the sum of its original value (which was 3) and `b`: Since `b` is now 4, `a` becomes 3 + 4, which is 7.

Therefore, after the code is executed, the value of `a` is 7 and the value of `b` is 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 7, `b` is 4**
