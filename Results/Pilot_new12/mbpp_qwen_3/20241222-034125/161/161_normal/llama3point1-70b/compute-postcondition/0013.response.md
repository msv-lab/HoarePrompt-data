Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `a` is the 6th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, `b` is the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2**.

### Explanation:
- The loop starts from `2` and goes up to `n+1`. For each iteration, it updates `a` and `b` according to the Fibonacci sequence: `a, b = b, a + b`.
- Initially, `a = 2` and `b = 1`. After the first iteration (when `n = 3`), `a` becomes `1` and `b` becomes `3`.
- After the second iteration (when `n = 4`), `a` becomes `3` and `b` becomes `4`.
- After the third iteration (when `n = 5`), `a` becomes `4` and `b` becomes `7`.

Following this pattern, we can generalize that after `k` iterations, `a` will be the \((k+1)\)-th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, and `b` will be the \((k+2)\)-th Fibonacci number starting from index 2.

Thus, if the loop executes \(n-2\) times (since it starts from 2), `a` will be the \((n-1)\)-th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, and `b` will be the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number starting from index 2. Since `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute at least 3 times, the general form is that `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute at least 3 times, and the final values of `a` and `b` will follow the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 2nd index.
