`a` is assigned the value `2` and `b` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, `a` is 2, and `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
