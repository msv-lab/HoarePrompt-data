According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be increased by 1 to meet the condition of the loop.

So, the updated states are:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `a` remains 3
- `b` remains 4

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
