According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `n` must allow the loop to continue. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n`, so for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 (since the previous loop ran up to `n-1`).

Therefore, the new state should reflect these adjustments:
- `n` must now be greater than 3.
- `a` remains 1.
- `b` remains 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
