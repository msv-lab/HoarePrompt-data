The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and also updates `b` to be the sum of its original value and the new value of `a`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After the swap, `a` will take the value of `b` (which is 3), and `b` will be updated to the sum of its original value (3) and the original value of `a` (1), which is 4. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
