State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop iterates from `2` to `n + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `2` because the range starts from `2`.
3. The values of `a` and `b` (`a` is 2 and `b` is 1) do not affect the loop's ability to execute; they remain unchanged within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 2 while keeping the values of `a` and `b` as they are.
