The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple return points:
- Case_1: If a specific condition is met, the function returns 2.
- Case_2: If another specific condition is met, the function returns 1.
- Case_3: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either 2, 1, or the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2 based on certain conditions.
