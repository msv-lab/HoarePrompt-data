Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. However, based on the annotated version and the problem description, it appears there is a misunderstanding. The function provided is actually computing the n+1-th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, not the n-th Lucas number. 

The Lucas sequence is defined as \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\) with initial conditions \(L(0) = 2\) and \(L(1) = 1\). The function, however, computes the Fibonacci sequence starting from \(F(2) = 2\) and \(F(3) = 1\), and returns the (n+1)-th term of this sequence. This means:

- For \(n=0\), the function should return 2 (which is correct).
- For \(n=1\), the function should return 1 (which is correct).
- For \(n>1\), the function should return the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number, not the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence, and the original assessment is not accurate. The correct final assessment is **False**.
