Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks to find the n'th Lucas number, but the provided code implements a function that computes the n'th Fibonacci number starting from the second term (index 2). According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should return the n'th Lucas number, which is defined differently:

- The first two Lucas numbers are L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1.
- For n > 1, the n'th Lucas number is L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).

However, the given code computes the n'th Fibonacci number, which starts with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1, and follows the relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). This means the code is returning the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number starting from index 0, not the n'th Lucas number.

For example, if `n = 2`, the expected Lucas number is 3 (since L(2) = 2 + 1), but the code would return 2 (the third Fibonacci number, F(2)). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
