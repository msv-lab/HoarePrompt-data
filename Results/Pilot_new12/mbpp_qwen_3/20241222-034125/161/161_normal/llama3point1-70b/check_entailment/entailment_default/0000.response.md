Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the n-th Lucas number using a iterative approach. However, the output hints indicate that the function returns either 2, 1, or the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2 based on the value of `n`. According to the definition of the Lucas numbers, the first two numbers are 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Therefore, the n-th Lucas number should be calculated as follows:

- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \) for \( n > 1 \)

However, the provided code incorrectly computes the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. For example, if `n = 5`, the correct Lucas number is 11, but the code would return 8, which is the 6th Fibonacci number. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
