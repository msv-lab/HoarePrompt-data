Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should compute the n'th Lucas number, not the n'th Fibonacci number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. 

The function provided in the program correctly implements the Lucas sequence. However, the output hints suggest that the function returns the 7th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, which is incorrect. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not meet the problem description and the provided output hints do not align with the intended functionality.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment of the program's correctness is False.
