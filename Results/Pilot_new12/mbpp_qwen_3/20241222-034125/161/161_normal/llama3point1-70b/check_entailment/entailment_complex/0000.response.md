Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 and 1:
   - If `n` is 0, it returns 2, which matches the first Lucas number.
   - If `n` is 1, it returns 1, which matches the second Lucas number.

2. **Recursive Case**: For any other value of `n`, the function computes the n'th Lucas number using the formula \(L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}\), starting with the initial values \(L_0 = 2\) and \(L_1 = 1\). The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the variables `a` and `b` such that `a` always holds the (n+1)-th Lucas number and `b` holds the n-th Lucas number. After the loop completes, `b` contains the n'th Lucas number, which is returned by the function.

3. **Logic Flow**: The logic flow of the program matches the problem description. It correctly computes the n'th Lucas number by building the Fibonacci-like sequence starting from the initial values 2 and 1, and it returns the appropriate result based on the value of `n`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number for all valid inputs as per the problem description, the program is correct.
