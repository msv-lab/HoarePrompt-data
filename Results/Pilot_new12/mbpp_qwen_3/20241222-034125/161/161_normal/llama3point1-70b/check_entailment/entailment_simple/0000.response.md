Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. However, the annotated program implements a function to find the n'th Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas numbers are defined as a sequence where each number is the sum of its two immediate predecessors, starting with 2 and 1, while the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

- For \( n = 0 \), the program returns 2, which is correct for the 0th Lucas number.
- For \( n = 1 \), the program returns 1, which is correct for the 1st Lucas number.
- For \( n > 1 \), the program calculates values as if they were Fibonacci numbers but incorrectly starts from 2 and 1. The Lucas sequence is defined as \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \) with initial values \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \). However, the program returns the (n+1)th Fibonacci number starting from index 2, which does not match the definition of the Lucas sequence.

To meet the problem description correctly, the function should start with \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \) and calculate subsequent terms accordingly.
