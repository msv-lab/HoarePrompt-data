Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` correctly by returning 2 and 1, respectively. For other values of `n`, the function uses a loop to compute the Lucas number iteratively, which is correct. The annotated version confirms that the function works as intended, especially for larger values of `n`. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
