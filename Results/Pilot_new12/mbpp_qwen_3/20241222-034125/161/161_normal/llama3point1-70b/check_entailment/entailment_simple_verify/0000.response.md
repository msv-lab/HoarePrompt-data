Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the n'th Lucas number based on the given problem description. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function handles the base cases correctly (`n = 0` returns 2, and `n = 1` returns 1). For larger values of `n`, the function uses a loop to iteratively compute the Lucas numbers. The annotations provided match the expected behavior of the function, and there is no indication of any logical errors or mismatches between the code and the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and annotations.
