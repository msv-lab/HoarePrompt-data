Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` correctly. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to compute the Lucas number iteratively, which is correct. Since the function works correctly for the initial terms and follows the recursive definition of the Lucas sequence, it meets the requirements for finding the n'th Lucas number in all potential cases.
