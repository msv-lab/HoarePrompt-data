Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to find the n'th Lucas number. The annotated version of the code and the original assessment mistakenly refer to the sequence as the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Therefore, the program, which computes Fibonacci numbers, does not meet the requirements of finding the n'th Lucas number. The annotations and the original assessment incorrectly reference the Fibonacci sequence, leading to an incorrect evaluation.
