Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The program handles the base cases (n = 0 and n = 1) correctly and uses a loop to compute the n'th Lucas number for larger values of n. Since the logic follows the definition of the Lucas sequence for all tested cases, the program appears to be correct.
