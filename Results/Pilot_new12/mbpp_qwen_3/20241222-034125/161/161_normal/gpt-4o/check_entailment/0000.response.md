Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach. However, the program has an off-by-one error in the loop condition, which causes it to miss the last iteration when calculating the Lucas number. Specifically, the loop should run until `n`, but it runs until `n + 1`.

The correct loop condition should be `for _ in range(2, n)` instead of `for _ in range(2, n + 1)`. This ensures that the loop correctly computes the nth Lucas number for all valid inputs.

For example, if `n = 9`, the loop will run from `2` to `8` (inclusive), and the final value of `b` will be the 9th Lucas number. With the current implementation, the loop runs from `2` to `9`, leading to an incorrect result.
