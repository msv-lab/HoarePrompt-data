Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function to find the n-th Lucas number. However, the provided program implements a function to find the n-th Fibonacci number, starting with the initial values 2 and 1. The Lucas numbers are defined as a sequence where each number is the sum of its two immediate predecessors, similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial values: \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \).

To meet the problem description, the function should return the n-th Lucas number. Here's a brief comparison:

- For \( n = 0 \): The Lucas number \( L(0) = 2 \), but the function returns 2, which is correct.
- For \( n = 1 \): The Lucas number \( L(1) = 1 \), but the function returns 1, which is correct.
- For \( n = 2 \): The Lucas number \( L(2) = 3 \), but the function returns 3, which is correct.
- For \( n = 3 \): The Lucas number \( L(3) = 4 \), but the function returns 4, which is correct.
- For \( n = 4 \): The Lucas number \( L(4) = 7 \), but the function returns 7, which is correct.
- For \( n = 5 \): The Lucas number \( L(5) = 11 \), but the function returns 11, which is correct.
- For \( n = 6 \): The Lucas number \( L(6) = 18 \), but the function returns 18, which is correct.
- For \( n = 7 \): The Lucas number \( L(7) = 29 \), but the function returns 29, which is correct.
- For \( n = 8 \): The Lucas number \( L(8) = 47 \), but the function returns 47, which is correct.
- For \( n = 9 \): The Lucas number \( L(9) = 76 \), but the function returns 76, which is correct.

However, the function is actually calculating Fibonacci numbers, not Lucas numbers. The Lucas numbers are generated differently, with the initial values being 2 and 1. To generate the correct Lucas numbers, the function should use the initial values 2 and 1 but follow the same logic as the Fibonacci sequence to generate the rest of the sequence.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
