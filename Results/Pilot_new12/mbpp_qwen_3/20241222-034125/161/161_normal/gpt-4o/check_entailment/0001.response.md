Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach. However, the initial values for the Lucas sequence are set to 2 and 1 (`a = 2` and `b = 1`), which do not match the standard Lucas sequence starting with 2 and 1. The standard Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, but the program does not handle cases where the input `n` is negative or non-integer, which is a common requirement for such functions.

To verify this, consider the standard Lucas sequence:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3
- L(3) = 4
- L(4) = 7
- L(5) = 11
- L(6) = 18
- L(7) = 29
- L(8) = 47
- L(9) = 76

The program returns the correct values for `func_1(9)` and `func_1(4)`, but it does not correctly compute `L(2)`, `L(3)`, etc., as shown above. For instance, for `n = 2`, the correct Lucas number is 3, but the program returns 4.

Therefore, since the program does not generate the correct Lucas numbers for all cases, the correctness is **False**.
