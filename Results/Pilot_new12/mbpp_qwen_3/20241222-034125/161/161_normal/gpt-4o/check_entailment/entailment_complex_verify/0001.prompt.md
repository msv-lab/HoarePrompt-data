You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach. However, the initial values for the Lucas sequence are set to 2 and 1 (`a = 2` and `b = 1`), which do not match the standard Lucas sequence starting with 2 and 1. The standard Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, but the program does not handle cases where the input `n` is negative or non-integer, which is a common requirement for such functions.

To verify this, consider the standard Lucas sequence:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3
- L(3) = 4
- L(4) = 7
- L(5) = 11
- L(6) = 18
- L(7) = 29
- L(8) = 47
- L(9) = 76

The program returns the correct values for `func_1(9)` and `func_1(4)`, but it does not correctly compute `L(2)`, `L(3)`, etc., as shown above. For instance, for `n = 2`, the correct Lucas number is 3, but the program returns 4.

Therefore, since the program does not generate the correct Lucas numbers for all cases, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If \( n \geq 2 \), \( a \) is the \( (n-1) \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1, and \( b \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1; otherwise, \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \).
            return b
            #The program returns the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns either 2, 1, or the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1. Specifically:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- For any other value of `n` (i.e., \( n \geq 2 \)), the function computes the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1 using a loop and returns it.

The final state of the program after execution will be one of the following:
- If `n` is 0, the program will return 2.
- If `n` is 1, the program will return 1.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program will return the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1, where the sequence starts as 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, ...

This covers all potential cases, including the initial conditions and the general case of computing Fibonacci numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
