Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code implements the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1 instead of the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- \( L_0 = 2 \)
- \( L_1 = 1 \)
- \( L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

However, the code incorrectly calculates the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1, which does not match the definition of the Lucas sequence. For instance:
- \( L_2 = 3 \) (since \( L_2 = L_1 + L_0 = 1 + 2 \))
- \( L_3 = 4 \) (since \( L_3 = L_2 + L_1 = 3 + 1 \))

But the code returns 4 for \( n = 3 \), which is correct for the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1, but incorrect for the Lucas sequence. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
