Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that there is an off-by-one error in the loop condition of the function `func_1`. According to the annotations, the loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`, which means it misses the last iteration when calculating the Lucas number for `n >= 2`. Specifically, the loop should run from `2` to `n` to correctly compute the nth Lucas number. The annotations and the problem description clearly indicate that the function should return the nth Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1, but the current implementation does not achieve this due to the incorrect loop condition. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
