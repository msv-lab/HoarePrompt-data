Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function to find the n-th Lucas number. The problem description asks to write a function that finds the n-th Lucas number. However, the function provided actually computes the n-th Fibonacci number starting from the values 2 and 1, which is equivalent to the standard Lucas sequence starting from L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - When `n == 0`, the function returns 2, which matches the 0-th term of the Lucas sequence.
   - When `n == 1`, the function returns 1, which matches the 1-st term of the Lucas sequence.

2. **General Case**:
   - For `n >= 2`, the function uses a loop to compute the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively. In each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are updated to the next terms in the sequence, with `a` becoming `b` and `b` becoming `a + b`. After the loop completes, `b` contains the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 1, which is the n-th Lucas number.

Since the function handles all cases (initial conditions and general case) as specified in the problem description and correctly computes the n-th Lucas number, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is:

Correctness: **True**
