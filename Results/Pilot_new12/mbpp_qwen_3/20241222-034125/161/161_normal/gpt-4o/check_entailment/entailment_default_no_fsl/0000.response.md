Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the Lucas number sequence, which is defined as follows:
- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n \geq 2 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

The function `func_1` matches this definition:
- It returns 2 for \( n = 0 \).
- It returns 1 for \( n = 1 \).
- For \( n \geq 2 \), it computes the \( n \)-th Lucas number by iteratively summing the previous two values, starting from the base cases 2 and 1.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, covering all potential cases. Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
