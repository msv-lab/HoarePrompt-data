Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not generate the correct Lucas numbers for all cases. While the annotated version correctly describes the state of the program and the logic used, it confirms that the program uses the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1 instead of the actual Lucas sequence. 

The Lucas sequence is defined as:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3
- L(3) = 4
- L(4) = 7
- L(5) = 11
- L(6) = 18
- L(7) = 29
- L(8) = 47
- L(9) = 76

However, the program generates the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1. As shown in the original assessment, the program returns the correct values for `func_1(9)` and `func_1(4)`, but these are not the corresponding Lucas numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description of finding the \( n \)-th Lucas number.
