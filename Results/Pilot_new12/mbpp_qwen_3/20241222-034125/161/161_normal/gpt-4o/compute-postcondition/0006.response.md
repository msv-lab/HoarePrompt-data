`a` is assigned the value `2` and `b` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**
