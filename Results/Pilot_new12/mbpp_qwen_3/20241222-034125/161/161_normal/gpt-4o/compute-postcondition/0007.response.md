Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(2, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for _ in range(2, n + 1)` will execute as long as the range specified (2 to n+1) contains at least one valid value for the loop variable (which is `_` in this case).
   - For the range `range(2, n + 1)` to be valid and contain at least one element, `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Given the initial conditions, `n` cannot be 0 or 1 because it is explicitly stated that `n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `a` and `b` are not directly relevant to the loop condition but are provided as additional information.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
