According to the code, the loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive). The loop condition depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 because the loop starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is 3, and `b` is 1. Since the loop needs to continue, `n` must be increased to 3 or more. However, since the loop starts at 2 and iterates up to `n`, if `n` is exactly 2, the loop will not execute further. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.

The other variables (`a` and `b`) do not change within the loop based on the given information.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 1**
