According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is 1, and `b` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 3.
2. The loop increments from 2 to `n`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `a` remains 1.
- `b` remains 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 4**
