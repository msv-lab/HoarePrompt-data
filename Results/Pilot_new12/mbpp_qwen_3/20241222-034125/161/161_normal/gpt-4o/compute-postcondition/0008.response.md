The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. After executing the code:

- `b` is reassigned to its original value, which is 1.
- `a` is reassigned to the sum of the original values of `b` and `a`, which is `1 + 2 = 3`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 1**
