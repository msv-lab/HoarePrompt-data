The code `a, b = b, a + b` performs a simultaneous assignment. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 1. 

- First, the value of `b` (which is 1) is assigned to `a`.
- Then, the value of `a + b` (which is 3 + 1 = 4) is assigned to `b`.

After this, the value of `n` remains unchanged because `n` is not affected by this code. So, the updated values are `a` is 1, `b` is 4.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 4**
