The code snippet `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 4. The first part of the tuple assignment sets `a` to the current value of `b`, which is 4. The second part sets `b` to the sum of its current value (which is 4) and the current value of `a` (which is 1), resulting in `b` being set to 5.

Therefore, after the code execution, `a` is 4 and `b` is 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 5**
