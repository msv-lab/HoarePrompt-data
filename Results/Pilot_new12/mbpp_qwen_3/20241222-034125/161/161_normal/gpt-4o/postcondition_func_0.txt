The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns either 2, 1, or the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1. Specifically:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- For any other value of `n` (i.e., \( n \geq 2 \)), the function computes the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1 using a loop and returns it.

The final state of the program after execution will be one of the following:
- If `n` is 0, the program will return 2.
- If `n` is 1, the program will return 1.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program will return the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from 2 and 1, where the sequence starts as 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, ...

This covers all potential cases, including the initial conditions and the general case of computing Fibonacci numbers.
