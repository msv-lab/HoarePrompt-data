Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted, which meets the requirement of the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function concatenates the lists, sorts the combined list, and returns it. There is no indication in the annotations or the problem description that the function does not meet its requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
