Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, concatenates them into a single list, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns it. This behavior matches the problem description exactly. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases where one or more of the input lists are empty, returning a sorted list containing only the integers from the non-empty lists. Since the code meets the requirements for all described cases, the correctness is True.
