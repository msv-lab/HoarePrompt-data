Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted, which meets the requirement of the problem description. Since the function works correctly for merging and sorting any three lists, there is no potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the given problem description.
