Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes three lists of integers as input, merges them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function. The annotated version also mentions that the function will return a sorted list containing all integers from the three lists combined, even if one or more of the input lists are empty. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
