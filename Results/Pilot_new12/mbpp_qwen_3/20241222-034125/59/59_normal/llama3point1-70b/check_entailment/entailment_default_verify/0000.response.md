Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, merges them into a single list, and returns the sorted version of this combined list. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases where one or more of the input lists are empty by still returning a sorted list of the non-empty lists' integers. The function correctly merges and sorts the lists for any valid input, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
