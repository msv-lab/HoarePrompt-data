Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single sorted list. It achieves this by first concatenating the three lists using the `+` operator and then sorting the resulting list with the `sorted()` function. Since the problem description states that the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list, the program meets this requirement for any valid input of three lists of integers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
