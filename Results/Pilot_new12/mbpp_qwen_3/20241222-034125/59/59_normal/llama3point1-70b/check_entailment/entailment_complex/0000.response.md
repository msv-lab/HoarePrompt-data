Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, concatenates them into a single list, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. This exactly matches the requirement to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The explanation in the comments also correctly describes the behavior of the function, including how it handles edge cases (e.g., when one or more of the input lists are empty). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
