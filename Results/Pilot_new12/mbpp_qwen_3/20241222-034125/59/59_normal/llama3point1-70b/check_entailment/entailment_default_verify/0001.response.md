Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of merging three lists into a single sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function concatenates the input lists and sorts the result, handling edge cases like empty lists appropriately. Since the program behaves as expected according to the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate.
