Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` concatenates the three lists using the `+` operator, then sorts the resulting combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a sorted list regardless of whether the input lists are empty or contain integers. Since the code handles all described cases and the problem description is met for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
