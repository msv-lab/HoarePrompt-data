Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning a sorted list containing all integers from the three input lists. Since the function correctly merges and sorts the lists for any valid input, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness as True is justified.
