Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single list, which is then sorted using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the resulting list is always sorted regardless of the input lists. Since the function correctly merges and sorts the lists for any potential input, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
