Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes three lists (list1, list2, and list3) as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The annotations support the correctness of the function, as they describe the state of the program right before and after the function call, indicating that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
