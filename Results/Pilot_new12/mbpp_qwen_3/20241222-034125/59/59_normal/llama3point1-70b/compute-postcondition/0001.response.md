The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a sorted list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and return a sorted list containing all the integers from these lists combined.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers. It returns a sorted list containing all integers from list1, list2, and list3 combined.**
