#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all integers from list1, list2, and list3 combined
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, combines all integers from the three lists, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include when one or more of the input lists are empty; in such cases, the function will still return a sorted list containing only the non-empty lists' integers. There is no missing functionality as the code accurately performs the described operations.
