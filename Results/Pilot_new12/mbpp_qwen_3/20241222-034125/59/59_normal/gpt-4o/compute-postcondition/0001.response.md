`sorted_list` is assigned the value of `sorted(combined_list)`. This means `sorted_list` is a new list containing all elements of `combined_list` sorted in ascending order. The original lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list containing all elements of `list1` followed by all elements of `list2` and then all elements of `list3`, `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
