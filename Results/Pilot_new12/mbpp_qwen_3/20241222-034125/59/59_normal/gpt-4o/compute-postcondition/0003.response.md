The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of integers sorted in ascending order, which contains all elements of `list1`, followed by all elements of `list2`, and then all elements of `list3`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and return a single list of integers sorted in ascending order containing all elements from the input lists in the specified order.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, each being a list of integers. It returns a list of integers sorted in ascending order, which contains all elements of `list1`, followed by all elements of `list2`, and then all elements of `list3`.**
