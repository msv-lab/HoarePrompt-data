Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, each being a list of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function handles all integer elements from the input lists and ensures they are sorted together. Potential edge cases include when any of the input lists are empty; in such cases, the returned list will only contain the non-empty lists' elements. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
