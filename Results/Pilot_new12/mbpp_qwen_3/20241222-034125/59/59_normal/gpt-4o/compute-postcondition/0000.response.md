The code concatenates `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a new list called `combined_list`. The values of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged, but a new list `combined_list` is created which contains all the elements from `list1`, followed by all the elements from `list2`, and then all the elements from `list3`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is a list containing all elements of `list1` followed by all elements of `list2` and then all elements of `list3`**
