Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly merges and sorts three input lists. The output hints confirm that the function handles all integer elements from the input lists and sorts them together. While the hints mention potential edge cases like empty lists, these do not affect the correctness of the function under the assumption that valid inputs are provided. The provided assertions also validate the function across different scenarios, including lists with duplicates and varying lengths. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
