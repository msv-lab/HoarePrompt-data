Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them into a single list, and then sorts this combined list in ascending order. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling all integer elements from the input lists and ensuring they are sorted together. The provided assertions also verify the correctness of the function for the given test cases. Since there are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would cause the function to fail, and the function meets the requirements of the problem description, the original assessment of correctness (True) is maintained.
