Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and sorts it. The function concatenates the three input lists using `list1 + list2 + list3` and then sorts the resulting list using `sorted()`. This approach ensures that the merged list is sorted. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements, lists with overlapping elements, and lists of different lengths. The function handles these cases correctly, and no counterexamples were found that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
