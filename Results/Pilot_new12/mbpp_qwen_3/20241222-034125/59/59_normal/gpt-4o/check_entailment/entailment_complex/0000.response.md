Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are expected to be lists of integers.
2. **Concatenation and Sorting**: The function combines these lists using the `+` operator, creating a single list `combined_list`. It then sorts this combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and returns the sorted list.
3. **Order of Elements**: The returned list contains all elements from `list1`, followed by all elements from `list2`, and then all elements from `list3`, ensuring that the final list is sorted.
4. **Edge Cases**: The provided test cases cover different scenarios (including lists with duplicate values, empty lists, and various element orders) and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for these cases.

Since the program correctly performs the task described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, it is correct.
