Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as inputs, which aligns with the problem description of merging three lists.
2. Inside the function, these three lists are combined using the `+` operator, resulting in a single list containing all elements from the input lists.
3. The combined list is then sorted using the `sorted()` function, ensuring that the final output is a sorted list.
4. The sorted list is returned by the function, meeting the requirement of returning a single sorted list that contains all elements from the original three lists.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected for different sets of input lists. Therefore, the program correctly implements the described functionality.
