Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` concatenates the three input lists and then sorts the combined list. The output examples given in the problem description match the expected behavior of the function. The code handles all potential cases where the input lists can be of any length, including the edge case where one or more lists might be empty. Since the code works correctly for all provided examples and the problem description, and there are no indications of missing functionality or incorrect handling of cases, the program is correct.
