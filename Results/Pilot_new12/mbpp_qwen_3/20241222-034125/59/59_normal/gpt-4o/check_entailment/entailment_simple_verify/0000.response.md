Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three input lists into a single list and sorts it in ascending order. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, combining and sorting the elements of the input lists. The provided test cases in the assertions validate that the function works correctly for the given inputs, and there are no issues or edge cases identified that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
