#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a list of integers sorted in ascending order, which contains all elements of `list1`, followed by all elements of `list2`, and then all elements of `list3`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, each being a list of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function handles all integer elements from the input lists and ensures they are sorted together. Potential edge cases include when any of the input lists are empty; in such cases, the returned list will only contain the non-empty lists' elements. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
