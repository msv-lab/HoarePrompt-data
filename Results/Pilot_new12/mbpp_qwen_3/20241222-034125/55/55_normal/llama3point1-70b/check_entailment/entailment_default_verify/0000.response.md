Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without any separators, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both non-empty and empty strings appropriately. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
