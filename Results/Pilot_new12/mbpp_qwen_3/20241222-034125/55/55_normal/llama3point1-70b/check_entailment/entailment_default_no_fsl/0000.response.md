Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and joins them together without any separators. The function handles the case where the input string is an empty string by returning an empty string. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the function works correctly for every potential case described.
