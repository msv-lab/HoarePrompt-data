Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. The function `func_1` takes a snake case string, splits it into words using underscores as delimiters, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then joins them together without any separators. This approach accurately implements the transformation required by the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as intended, including handling an empty string by returning an empty string. There are no edge cases or examples provided that suggest the code does not meet the requirements.
