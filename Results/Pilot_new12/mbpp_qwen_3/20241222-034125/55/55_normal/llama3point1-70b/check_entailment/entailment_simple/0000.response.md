Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a snake case string as input and converts it to a camel case string. Here's a breakdown of why it satisfies the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a single argument `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string.
2. **Transformation**: The function correctly splits the snake case string into individual words using the underscore (`_`) as the delimiter.
3. **Capitalization**: Each word in the resulting list is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
4. **Joining**: The capitalized words are then joined together without any separators, forming the camel case string.
5. **Output**: The function returns the generated camel case string.

Since the program performs the exact transformation required (splitting the snake case string into words, capitalizing each word, and joining them together), it adheres to the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
