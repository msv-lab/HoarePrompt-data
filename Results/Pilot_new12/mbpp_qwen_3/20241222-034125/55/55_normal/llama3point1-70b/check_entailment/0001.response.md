Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all valid snake case inputs. It splits the input string by underscores and capitalizes each word, joining them back together without any additional characters. This logic handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the conversion from snake case to camel case is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
