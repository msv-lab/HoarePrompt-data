Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string according to the given problem description and output hints. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without any additional characters, which aligns with the expected behavior of converting snake case to camel case. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string by returning an empty string, as indicated by the output hints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
