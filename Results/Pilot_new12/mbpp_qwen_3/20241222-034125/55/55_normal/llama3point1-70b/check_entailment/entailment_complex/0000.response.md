Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores. The problem description specifies that the input should contain only lowercase letters and underscores, and the function correctly processes this type of input.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The function splits the `snake_case_str` into individual words using the underscore (`_`) as a delimiter with `split('_')`. Then, it capitalizes the first letter of each word using a generator expression inside `join()` and forms the `camel_case_str` by joining these words together without any separators.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The problem description mentions the handling of an empty string by returning an empty string, which is correctly implemented in the provided code.

4. **Output**: The function returns the transformed `camel_case_str`, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Since the function `func_1` processes the input as specified and produces the correct output, the program is correct according to the problem description.
