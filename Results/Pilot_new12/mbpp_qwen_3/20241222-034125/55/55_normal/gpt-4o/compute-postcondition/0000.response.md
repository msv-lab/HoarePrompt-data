The `split` method is called on `snake_str` using the underscore `_` as the delimiter. This will split the string into a list of substrings based on the underscores. The original string `snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores. After splitting, each substring (excluding the underscores) will become an element in the `components` list.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores, `components` is a list of substrings from `snake_str` separated by underscores**
