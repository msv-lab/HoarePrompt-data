Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_str` which consists only of lowercase letters and underscores. It splits `snake_str` into substrings based on underscores, then capitalizes the first letter of each substring, and finally joins these capitalized substrings together into a single string without any separators. This results in a new string where each component (originally separated by underscores) is capitalized. The function returns this new string. Potential edge cases include an empty input string or a `snake_str` that contains no underscores, in which case the function will simply return the original string as it is already in the desired format. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly handles the specified requirements.**
