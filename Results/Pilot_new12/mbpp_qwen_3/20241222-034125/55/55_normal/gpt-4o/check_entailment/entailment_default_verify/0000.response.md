Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings as described. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, handling edge cases such as an empty string or a string without underscores. Since the provided test cases and the logic in the function align with the problem description and the output hints, the program is correct.
