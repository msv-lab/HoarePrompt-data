Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings based on the examples given and the general logic applied. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. This approach handles the provided test cases and should work for any valid snake case string. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description, and the function appears to handle the basic requirements effectively, the program is correct.
