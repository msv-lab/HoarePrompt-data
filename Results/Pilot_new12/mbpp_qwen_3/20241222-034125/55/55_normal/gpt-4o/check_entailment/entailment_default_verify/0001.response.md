Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings based on the problem description and the provided output hints. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together into a single string. This approach handles the provided test cases and works for any valid snake case string, including edge cases like an empty string or a string with no underscores. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and there is no indication that the function is missing any necessary functionality. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
