Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each resulting substring, and then joins them together without any separators. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no underscores by simply returning the original string, which is already in the desired format. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code works as expected for every potential case.
