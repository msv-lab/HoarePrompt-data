Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a snake case string (a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores) and converts it to a camel case string. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function splits the input string at each underscore (`_`) using `snake_str.split('_')`. This results in a list of substrings, each of which is a word from the original snake case string.
2. It then uses a generator expression `x.capitalize()` to capitalize the first letter of each substring.
3. Finally, it joins these capitalized substrings together without any separators using `''.join(...)`, resulting in a camel case string.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs:

- `func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'`: The input 'python_program' is split into ['python', 'program'], which are then capitalized to ['Python', 'Program'] and joined to form 'PythonProgram'.
- `func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'`: The input 'python_language' is split into ['python', 'language'], which are then capitalized to ['Python', 'Language'] and joined to form 'PythonLanguage'.
- `func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'`: The input 'programming_language' is split into ['programming', 'language'], which are then capitalized to ['Programming', 'Language'] and joined to form 'ProgrammingLanguage'.

Since the function correctly transforms the snake case strings into camel case strings as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
