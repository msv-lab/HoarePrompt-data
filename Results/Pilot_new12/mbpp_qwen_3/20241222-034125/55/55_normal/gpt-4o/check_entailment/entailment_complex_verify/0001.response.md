Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected: it splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together. The function handles the provided test cases correctly and the explanation in the annotations aligns with the logic of the function. No edge cases or potential issues are mentioned that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
