You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'
assert func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'
assert func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores (_).
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string with each substring in 'components' capitalized and joined together without any separators
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_str` which consists only of lowercase letters and underscores. It splits `snake_str` into substrings based on underscores, then capitalizes the first letter of each substring, and finally joins these capitalized substrings together into a single string without any separators. This results in a new string where each component (originally separated by underscores) is capitalized. The function returns this new string. Potential edge cases include an empty input string or a `snake_str` that contains no underscores, in which case the function will simply return the original string as it is already in the desired format. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly handles the specified requirements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
