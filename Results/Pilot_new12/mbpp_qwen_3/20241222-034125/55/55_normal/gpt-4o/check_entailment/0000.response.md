Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings for all tested examples. It splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. Since the examples given (`'python_program'`, `'python_language'`, and `'programming_language'`) all produce the expected outputs (`'PythonProgram'`, `'PythonLanguage'`, and `'ProgrammingLanguage'`), and there are no apparent logical errors in the code, it appears to handle the problem description accurately for the given test cases. Given that no counterexample has been found where the program fails, we can conclude that the program is correct.
