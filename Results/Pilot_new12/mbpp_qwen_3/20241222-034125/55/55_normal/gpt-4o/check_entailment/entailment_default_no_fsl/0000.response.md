Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It handles the specified requirements and potential edge cases such as an empty input string or a string without underscores. The code splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each resulting substring, and then joins them together without any separators. This matches the problem description and the output hints provided.
