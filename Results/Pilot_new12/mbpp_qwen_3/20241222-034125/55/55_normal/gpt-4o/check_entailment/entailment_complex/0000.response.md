Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single string argument `snake_str`, which is a valid snake case string (consisting of lowercase letters and underscores).

2. **Conversion Logic**: 
   - The string is split into components using `snake_str.split('_')`. Each component represents a word in the snake case string.
   - The `x.capitalize()` method is used to capitalize the first letter of each component.
   - These capitalized components are then joined together using `''.join(...)`, resulting in a camel case string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string or a string without underscores (`_`) is handled correctly, as the function simply returns the original string.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios:
   - `'python_program'` -> `'PythonProgram'`
   - `'python_language'` -> `'PythonLanguage'`
   - `'programming_language'` -> `'ProgrammingLanguage'`

Since the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.
