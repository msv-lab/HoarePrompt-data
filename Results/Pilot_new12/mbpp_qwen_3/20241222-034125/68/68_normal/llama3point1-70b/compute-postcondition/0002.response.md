The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and return its phase angle in radians.
