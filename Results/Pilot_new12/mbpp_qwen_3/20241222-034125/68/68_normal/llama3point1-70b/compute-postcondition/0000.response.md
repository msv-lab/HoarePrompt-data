The code creates a complex number using the `real` and `imag` values. The variable `complex_num` is assigned the value of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`. The initial values of `real` and `imag` are preserved.

Output State: **`real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_num` is a complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`**
