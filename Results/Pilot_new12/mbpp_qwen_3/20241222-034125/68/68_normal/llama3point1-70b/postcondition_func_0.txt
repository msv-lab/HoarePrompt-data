The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then constructs a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis in the complex plane. This function handles valid inputs for `real` and `imag`, including both positive and negative values. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as when `real` and `imag` are both zero, in which case the phase angle would be undefined. The function also does not account for any input validation to ensure that `real` and `imag` are indeed real numbers.
