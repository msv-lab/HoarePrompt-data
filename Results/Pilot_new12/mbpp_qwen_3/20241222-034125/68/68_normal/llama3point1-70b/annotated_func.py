#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part 'real' and imaginary part 'imag'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then constructs a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis in the complex plane. This function handles valid inputs for `real` and `imag`, including both positive and negative values. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as when `real` and `imag` are both zero, in which case the phase angle would be undefined. The function also does not account for any input validation to ensure that `real` and `imag` are indeed real numbers.
