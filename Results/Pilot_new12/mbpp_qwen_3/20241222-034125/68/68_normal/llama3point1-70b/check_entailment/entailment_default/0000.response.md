Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. However, the problem description asks for a function that gets the angle of a complex number, and the code does meet this requirement for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case when both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which results in an undefined phase angle. Although the hints mention this as an edge case, it is a valid concern because the function should either handle this situation or clearly indicate that the phase angle is undefined. Since the code does not address this case, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential input.
