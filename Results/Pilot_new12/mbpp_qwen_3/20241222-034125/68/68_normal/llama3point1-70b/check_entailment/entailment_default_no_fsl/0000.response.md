Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the edge case where both `real` and `imag` are zero. In this case, the `cmath.phase` function returns `0`, but mathematically, the phase angle is undefined (it can be considered as 0 or Ï€ depending on the convention, but not precisely defined). Since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle this case, the function should either raise an error or return a specific value to indicate that the phase angle is undefined. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
