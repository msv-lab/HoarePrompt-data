Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these parts and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. This exactly matches the requirement to write a function that gets the angle of a complex number. Therefore, the program is correct as per the given problem description.
