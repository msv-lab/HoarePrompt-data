Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1(real, imag)` correctly calculates the angle of a complex number, which is true. However, the output hints mention that the function does not handle the edge case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, in which case the phase angle is undefined. While the function may work for most valid inputs, the absence of handling this specific edge case means that the function is not fully robust. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program should not be considered fully correct.
