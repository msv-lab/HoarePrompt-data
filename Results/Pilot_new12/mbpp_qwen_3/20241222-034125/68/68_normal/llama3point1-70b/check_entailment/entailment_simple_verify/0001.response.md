Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1(real, imag)` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations confirm that the function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then creates a complex number from these parts and returns the phase angle in radians. Since the problem description is to get the angle of a complex number, and the function performs this task correctly without any restrictions or missing cases, the program meets the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
