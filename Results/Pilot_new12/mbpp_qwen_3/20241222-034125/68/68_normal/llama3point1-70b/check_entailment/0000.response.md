Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase angle (also known as the argument) of the complex number, which satisfies the problem description. Since the function works for any valid complex number (where both real and imaginary parts are numbers), and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this implementation fails to handle, the program is correct.
