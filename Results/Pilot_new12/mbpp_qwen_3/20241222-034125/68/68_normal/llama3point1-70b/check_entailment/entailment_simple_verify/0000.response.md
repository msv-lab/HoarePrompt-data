Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The annotated version confirms that the function takes real numbers as inputs and returns the phase angle of the corresponding complex number. Since the problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the program fulfills this requirement without any issues or edge cases that would make it incorrect, the original assessment is correct.
