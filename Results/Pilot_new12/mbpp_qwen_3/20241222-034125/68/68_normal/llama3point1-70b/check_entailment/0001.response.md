Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(real, imag)` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. This function works for all valid real and imaginary inputs. Since the problem description is to get the angle of a complex number, and the function does exactly that without any restrictions or missing cases, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
