Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotated version confirms that the function handles valid inputs for `real` and `imag`, including both positive and negative values. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle the edge case where both `real` and `imag` are zero (which results in an undefined phase angle), this does not affect the overall correctness of the function since the problem description does not specify handling such edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
