Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then constructs a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis in the complex plane. 

The function adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description, although it does not explicitly validate the types of the inputs to ensure they are real numbers. However, as per the instructions, we are assuming that the inputs will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, under this assumption, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
