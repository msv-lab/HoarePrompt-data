You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase angle (also known as the argument) of the complex number, which satisfies the problem description. Since the function works for any valid complex number (where both real and imaginary parts are numbers), and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this implementation fails to handle, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then constructs a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed with the positive real axis in the complex plane. This function handles valid inputs for `real` and `imag`, including both positive and negative values. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as when `real` and `imag` are both zero, in which case the phase angle would be undefined. The function also does not account for any input validation to ensure that `real` and `imag` are indeed real numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
