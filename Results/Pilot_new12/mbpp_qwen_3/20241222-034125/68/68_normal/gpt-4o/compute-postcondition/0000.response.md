The code creates a complex number using the `real` and `imag` values. The `complex` function takes the `real` and `imag` values as arguments and creates a complex number. After the execution, the `real` and `imag` variables retain their original values, and a new variable `complex_number` is introduced, which holds the complex number created from `real` and `imag`.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_number` is a complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.**
