The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, and return the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers, and returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.**
