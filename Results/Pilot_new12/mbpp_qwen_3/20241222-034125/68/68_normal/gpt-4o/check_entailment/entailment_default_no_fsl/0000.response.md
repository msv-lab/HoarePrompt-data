Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The provided test cases assert that the function returns values close to the expected angles within a relative tolerance of 0.001. Given the output hints, the function correctly computes the phase angle for the given test cases. Since the problem description is to write a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the provided code satisfies this requirement for the given test cases without any apparent edge cases being overlooked, the code is correct.
