Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase (angle) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations confirm that the function takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs and returns the phase angle. The provided test cases validate the function with different inputs and compare the output to known values using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance, which confirms the correctness of the function. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
