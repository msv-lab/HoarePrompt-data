Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle (angle) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases provided in the form of assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given scenarios. The output hints also align with the functionality of the code, indicating that the function handles the creation of a complex number from real and imaginary parts and computes the phase angle accurately. Since there are no issues or edge cases mentioned that would invalidate the original assessment, we maintain that the program is correct.
