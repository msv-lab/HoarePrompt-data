Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function correctly computes the phase angle for any valid real and imaginary values. Given the examples and the problem description, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases.
