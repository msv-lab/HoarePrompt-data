You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases provided cover several scenarios:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` returns the angle for the imaginary unit `1j`, which should be approximately `1.5707963267948966` radians (90 degrees).
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` returns the angle for the complex number `2 + 1j`, which should be approximately `0.4636476090008061` radians.
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` returns the angle for the purely imaginary number `2j`, which again should be approximately `1.5707963267948966` radians.

Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the `cmath.phase` function is generally reliable, we can conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the provided function would fail based on the given examples and the general behavior of the `cmath` module.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number using these values and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed between the positive real axis and the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code, but the function correctly computes the phase angle for any valid real and imaginary values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
