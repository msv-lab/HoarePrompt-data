Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then creates a complex number using these parameters and returns its phase angle using `cmath.phase`. The provided assertions test the function with valid inputs and expected outputs, and the function behaves as intended for the given examples. Since the `cmath.phase` function is designed to calculate the phase angle of a complex number accurately, and the function is used correctly within the constraints of the problem description, the program is correct.
