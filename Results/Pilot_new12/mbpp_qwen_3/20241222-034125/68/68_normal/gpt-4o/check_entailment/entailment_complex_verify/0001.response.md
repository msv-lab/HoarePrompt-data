Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle (angle) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations clarify that the function takes two floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle in radians. The provided test cases cover typical scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Since there are no issues or edge cases identified in the annotated version, and the function meets the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
