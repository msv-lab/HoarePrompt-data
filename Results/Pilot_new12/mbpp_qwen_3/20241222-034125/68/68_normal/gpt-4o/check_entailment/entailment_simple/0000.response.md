Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function constructs a complex number using these parameters and then returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. 

The problem description asks for a function that gets the angle of a complex number. The function `func_1` correctly computes the phase angle of the given complex number, which aligns with the requirement of the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, further validating its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
