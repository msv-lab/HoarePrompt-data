Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It constructs a complex number from these parts and then returns its phase angle (the angle in radians). The phase angle is calculated using the `cmath.phase()` function, which is the appropriate method for obtaining the phase angle of a complex number.

The provided test cases assert that the function returns values close to the expected phase angles, within a relative tolerance of 0.001. These test cases cover both purely imaginary and non-purely imaginary complex numbers, ensuring that the function works for a range of inputs. Given that the function correctly uses the `cmath.phase()` function and the test cases validate the expected behavior, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
