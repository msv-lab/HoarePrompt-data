Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the cmath library. The function `func_1` takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs and returns the angle. The provided test cases check the function with different inputs and compare the output to known values using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance. Since the function uses the built-in `cmath.phase` function, which is designed to compute the phase of a complex number accurately, and the test cases cover typical scenarios, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
