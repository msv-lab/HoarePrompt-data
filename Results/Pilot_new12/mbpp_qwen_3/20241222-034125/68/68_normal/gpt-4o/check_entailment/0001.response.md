Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases provided cover several scenarios:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` returns the angle for the imaginary unit `1j`, which should be approximately `1.5707963267948966` radians (90 degrees).
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` returns the angle for the complex number `2 + 1j`, which should be approximately `0.4636476090008061` radians.
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` returns the angle for the purely imaginary number `2j`, which again should be approximately `1.5707963267948966` radians.

Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the `cmath.phase` function is generally reliable, we can conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the provided function would fail based on the given examples and the general behavior of the `cmath` module.
