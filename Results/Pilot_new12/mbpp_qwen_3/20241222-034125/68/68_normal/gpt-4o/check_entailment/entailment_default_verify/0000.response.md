Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles valid real and imaginary values appropriately and returns the expected phase angles. The test cases provided in the original assessment verify the correctness of the function for the given inputs, and there are no indications of any issues with the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
