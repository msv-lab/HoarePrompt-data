Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly computes the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations clearly describe the function's behavior and confirm that it operates as expected for the given problem description. The test cases validate the function against known values within an acceptable tolerance, further supporting the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
