#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part 'real' and imaginary part 'imag'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number using these values and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The phase angle is the angle formed between the positive real axis and the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code, but the function correctly computes the phase angle for any valid real and imaginary values.
