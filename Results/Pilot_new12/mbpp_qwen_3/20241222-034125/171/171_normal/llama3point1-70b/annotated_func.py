#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, or False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, or `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is not zero, `n` is odd and the function returns `True`; otherwise, `n` is even and the function returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly handles both positive and negative integers as well as zero.
