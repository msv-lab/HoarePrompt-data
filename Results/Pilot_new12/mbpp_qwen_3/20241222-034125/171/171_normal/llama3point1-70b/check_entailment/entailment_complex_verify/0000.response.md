Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. The annotation states that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, or `False` if `n` is an even integer. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function correctly implements this logic without any issues or edge cases mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and annotations.
