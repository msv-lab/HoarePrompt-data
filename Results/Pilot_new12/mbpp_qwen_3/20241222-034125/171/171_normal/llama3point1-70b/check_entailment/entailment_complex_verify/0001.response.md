Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1(n)` indeed returns `True` if the number `n` is odd and `False` if the number `n` is even. However, the problem description specifically asks for a function that finds whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function provided meets this requirement perfectly, as it correctly identifies odd numbers by returning `True`. The original assessment incorrectly states that the function is incorrect because it only returns `True` for odd numbers instead of specifying both odd and even parities. The function satisfies the problem description by correctly identifying the odd parity of the given number.
