Final: **False**

Reason: Although the function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies whether a given number is odd or even, the original problem description specifically asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. This means that the function already satisfies the requirement of returning the parity (odd or even) as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate based on the provided information and output hints.
