Final: **False**

Reason: The problem description asks for a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks if a number is odd by using the modulus operator (`n % 2 != 0`). However, the original assessment is correct in stating that the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. The current implementation only returns `True` for odd numbers, which means it does not fully meet the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns with the current implementation rather than the expected behavior described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the full requirements of the problem description.
