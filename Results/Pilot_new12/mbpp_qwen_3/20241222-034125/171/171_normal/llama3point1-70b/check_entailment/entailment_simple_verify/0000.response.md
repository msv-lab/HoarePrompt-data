Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `n % 2 != 0` correctly implements this logic, returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. Given the assumption that the input is always a valid integer, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
