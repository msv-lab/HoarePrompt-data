Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd, which is correct. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. 

The given function correctly identifies if a number is odd but does not satisfy the requirement of returning the parity (odd or even) as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
