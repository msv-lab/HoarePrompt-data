Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the parity of a given number. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if a number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. However, the problem description asks for the parity of a number, which typically refers to whether a number is even or odd. 

The current implementation returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, meaning it returns `True` when `n` is odd. While this part of the implementation is correct, the problem description asks to check the parity (even or odd), and the function should return `True` if the number is even (parity = even) and `False` if the number is odd (parity = odd).

To correct this, the function should be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This version will return `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd, thus correctly implementing the parity check.
