Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` meets the problem description. The function checks if a given number `n` is odd by evaluating `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles both positive and negative integers as well as zero. Since the problem description asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the function accomplishes this accurately without any edge cases or invalid input handling required (as per the assumption), the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
