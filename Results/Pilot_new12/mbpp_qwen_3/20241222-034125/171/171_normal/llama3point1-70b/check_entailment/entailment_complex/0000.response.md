Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, or `False` if `n` is an even integer. This is achieved by checking if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero using the modulo operator (`%`). 

Since the problem description asks to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, the function meets this requirement by returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The function works correctly for all valid integer inputs, including positive, negative, and zero, without any additional edge cases being required according to the provided annotations. Thus, the program is correct.
