Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if the parity of `n` is odd, and `False` if it is even. This is achieved by checking if `n % 2 != 0`, which correctly identifies odd numbers. The function works for both positive and negative integers as well as zero, as stated in the output hints. There are no edge cases mentioned in the hints, and the code handles them appropriately. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
