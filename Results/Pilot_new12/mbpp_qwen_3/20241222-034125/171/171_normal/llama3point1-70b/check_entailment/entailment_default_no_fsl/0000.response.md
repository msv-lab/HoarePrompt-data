Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly determines the parity of a given number by checking if the number is odd. It uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. If the remainder is not zero, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even. The output hints confirm that this function works for both positive and negative integers as well as zero, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function behaves as expected for all mentioned cases, the program is correct.
