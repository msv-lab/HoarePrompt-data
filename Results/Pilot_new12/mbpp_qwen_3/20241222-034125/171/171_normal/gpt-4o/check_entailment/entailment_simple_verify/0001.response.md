Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a Python function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. The provided function `func_1` uses the condition `n % 2 != 0` to check if a number is odd, which correctly identifies odd numbers but returns the opposite of what is required. Specifically, it returns `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers, violating the problem requirements. 

The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
