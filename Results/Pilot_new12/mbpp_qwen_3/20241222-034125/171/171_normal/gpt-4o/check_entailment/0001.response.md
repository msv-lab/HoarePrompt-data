Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. 

The provided test cases are:
- `assert func_1(12) == False` (correct, as 12 is even)
- `assert func_1(7) == True` (correct, as 7 is odd)
- `assert func_1(10) == False` (correct, as 10 is even)

While these test cases are correct, the function itself is incorrectly implemented because it returns `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers. This violates the requirement to return `True` for odd numbers. 

For example, if we call `func_1(3)`, the expected output should be `True` (since 3 is odd), but the function will return `False`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
