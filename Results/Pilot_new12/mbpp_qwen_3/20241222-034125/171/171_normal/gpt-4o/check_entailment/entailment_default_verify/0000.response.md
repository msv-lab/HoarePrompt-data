Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function to determine if the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1` currently checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` if the number is even (i.e., its parity is odd), and `False` if the number is odd. Therefore, the condition should be `n % 2 == 0`. The provided test cases and the function implementation indicate that the function is incorrectly implemented to check for odd numbers instead of even numbers, thus failing to meet the problem description.
