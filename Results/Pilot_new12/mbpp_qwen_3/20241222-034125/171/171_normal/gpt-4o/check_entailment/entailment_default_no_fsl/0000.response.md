Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` if the number is even (since even numbers have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2), and `False` if the number is odd. The current implementation returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which is incorrect. It should return `True` if `n % 2 == 0`. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
