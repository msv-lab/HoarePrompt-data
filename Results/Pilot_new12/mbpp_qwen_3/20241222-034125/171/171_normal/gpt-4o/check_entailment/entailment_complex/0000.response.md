Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the parity of a given number. According to the problem description, the task is to write a Python function that checks whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1` uses the modulus operator `%` to check if `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This logic perfectly matches the requirement to determine if the parity of the number is odd (which is equivalent to checking if the number itself is odd).

The assertions provided also validate the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(12) == False`: Since 12 is an even number, the function returns `False` correctly.
- `func_1(7) == True`: Since 7 is an odd number, the function returns `True` correctly.
- `func_1(10) == False`: Since 10 is an even number, the function returns `False` correctly.

Thus, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases of valid integer inputs.
