Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the parity of a given number. The function `func_1` uses the expression `n % 2 != 0` to check if a number is odd. However, this condition checks for odd numbers, which is correct, but the problem description specifically asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Parity typically refers to whether a number is even or odd, and the function should return `True` if the number is even (indicating even parity) and `False` if the number is odd (indicating odd parity).

The annotated test cases correctly reflect the requirement to return `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which is opposite to what the current implementation does. Therefore, the function should be modified to:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This change will ensure that the function returns `True` for even numbers (indicating even parity) and `False` for odd numbers (indicating odd parity), thus correctly implementing the problem description.
