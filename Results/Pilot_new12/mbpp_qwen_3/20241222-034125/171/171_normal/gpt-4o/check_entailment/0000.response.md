Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program `func_1` checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number is even (i.e., its parity is odd), and `False` if the number is odd. Therefore, the condition should be `n % 2 == 0`. 

For example, if we pass `7` to the function, it should return `False` because 7 is odd, but the function returns `True`. This violates the problem description.
