Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the function should determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means it should return `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd. However, the current implementation of `func_1` uses the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This contradicts the problem description. The annotated version correctly describes the behavior of the function as returning `True` if `n` is an odd integer, which further confirms that the function is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
