Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the number is odd. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` if the number is even (since even numbers have an odd parity). The correct implementation would be to return `n % 2 == 0`.

In the provided assertions:
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` should return `False` because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` should return `True` because 10 is even.

Since the function returns the opposite of what is expected according to the problem description, the program is incorrect.
