Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is supposed to check if the parity of a given number is odd. The original assessment correctly identified that the function returns `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers, which is the opposite of what is required. The annotated version confirms this behavior:

- The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which means it returns `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers.
- The test cases provided (`assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, `assert func_1(10) == False`) are correct in terms of syntax but incorrect according to the problem description because they expect `func_1` to return `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the problem description.
