Final: **False**

Reason: Despite the test cases being correct, the function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented according to the problem description. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the current implementation does the opposite, returning `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers. This violates the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
