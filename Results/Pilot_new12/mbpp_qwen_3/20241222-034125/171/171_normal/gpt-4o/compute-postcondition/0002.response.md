Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, or `False` if `n` is an even integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly implements the modulus operation to determine the parity of the integer. The function does not handle non-integer inputs; if a non-integer is passed, it will still evaluate the expression but the behavior is undefined since the `%` operator is defined only for integers.**
