Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `lst[i]` is an odd number.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over indices starting from 1 and increments by 2 each time (i.e., it checks every other element starting from the first element).

3. **Current State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop is currently checking `lst[1]`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - The condition `lst[i]` must still be an odd number.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `lst[3]` must be an odd number.

6. **Final State:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `lst[3]` is an odd number.

**State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, and `lst[3]` is an odd number**.
