State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.

According to the code, the loop will iterate over every second element in the list starting from index 1 (i.e., the second element) up to the length of the list. For the loop to execute, the list must have at least 2 elements because:

1. The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
2. The condition `1 <= i < len(lst)` must be true for the first iteration.
3. The increment `2` ensures that only every second element starting from index 1 is considered.

To ensure the loop can execute, the list must have at least 2 elements. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not run.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
