Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The annotated version supports this by indicating that the function iterates through the list, checking only the elements at odd indices (1-based indexing) and returning `False` if any of these elements are even. The function returns `True` only if all such elements are odd. 

The provided test cases validate this behavior:
1. `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: All elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
2. `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: There is no element at an odd index (1-based), which aligns with the function's logic since it does not encounter any even numbers at odd indices.
3. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The element at the second index (1-based) is even, causing the function to return `False`.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
