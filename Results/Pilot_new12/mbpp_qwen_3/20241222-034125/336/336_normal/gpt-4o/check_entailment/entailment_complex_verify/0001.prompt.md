You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: This list has odd numbers at all odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7).
2. `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: This list has an even number at the second index (1-based index), so it should return `False`, but the assertion is incorrect. However, this does not prove the function incorrect because the problem description did not specify the behavior for lists shorter than the minimum length required by the function's logic.
3. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: This list has an even number at the second index (1-based index).

Given the function's logic and the test cases provided, the function correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number. There are no clear counterexamples where the function fails to meet the requirements as described. Therefore, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with a length less than 2 or all elements with even indices (1-based) are odd.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if all elements at odd indices (1-based) are odd numbers. Otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element is odd. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, which would result in the function returning `True` since the condition is trivially satisfied.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
