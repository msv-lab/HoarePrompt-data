Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The output hints further confirm that the function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element is odd. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. The provided test cases also align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
