Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index (1-based) contains an odd number in the given list. Here's a detailed explanation of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to verify that all elements at odd indices (1-based indexing) in the input list `lst` are odd numbers.

2. **Loop Through Odd Indices**: The `for` loop iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element, which corresponds to the first odd index in 1-based indexing) and increments by 2, ensuring that only odd indices are checked. This is done using `range(1, len(lst), 2)`.

3. **Check Odd Numbers**: For each odd-indexed element, the function checks if the element is even using `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If an even number is found at any odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Return True if All Conditions Met**: If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` should return `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` should return `True` because the only odd index (1) has an odd number (1).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return `False` because the second element (at index 1) is even.

Since the function logic and the test cases align perfectly with the problem description, the function is correct.
