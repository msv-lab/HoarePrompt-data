Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether every odd index (1-based) contains an odd number in the given list. The function `func_1` iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, ensuring it only checks elements at odd indices. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the assertions, the code appears to handle all the cases correctly. The code does not explicitly handle edge cases like an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, but based on the problem description, these cases would trivially satisfy the condition (returning `True`), which aligns with the provided assertions. The code logic matches the problem description and handles all tested cases correctly.
