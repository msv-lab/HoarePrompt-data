Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index (1-based) contains an odd number in the given list. The annotations describe the behavior of the function and the states of the program at different points accurately. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. The provided examples also support this behavior, confirming that the function meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
