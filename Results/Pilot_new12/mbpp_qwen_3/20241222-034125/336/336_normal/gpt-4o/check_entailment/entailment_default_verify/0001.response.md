Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index (1-based) in the given list contains an odd number. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including edge cases like an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, which would result in the function returning `True` since there are no elements at odd indices to check. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
