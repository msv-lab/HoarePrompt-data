Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index (1-based indexing) contains an odd number in the given list. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a list of integers as its argument.
2. **Loop Iteration**: A for loop starts from index 1 and increments by 2, effectively checking every odd index (1-based) of the list.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element at the odd index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If any such element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also confirm the behavior:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the only element at an odd index (index 1) is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the element at the odd index (index 1) is even.

Thus, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description for all valid inputs.
