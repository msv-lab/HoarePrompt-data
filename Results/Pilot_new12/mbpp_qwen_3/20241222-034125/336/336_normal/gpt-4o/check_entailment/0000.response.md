Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The examples provided also support this behavior:
- For the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the function correctly returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- For the list `[4, 1, 2]`, the function correctly returns `True` because the element at the odd index 1 is odd.
- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function correctly returns `False` because the element at the odd index 1 is even.

Since the function behaves as described and the provided examples are consistent with the problem description, the function is correct.
