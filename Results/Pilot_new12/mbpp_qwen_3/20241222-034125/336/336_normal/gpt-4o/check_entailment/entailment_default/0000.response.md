Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to meet the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`.

Given the assertions provided:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: This list satisfies the condition because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: This list does not satisfy the condition because the element at the second index (1-based) is even.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: This list does not satisfy the condition because the element at the second index (1-based) is even.

The function correctly handles these cases and the provided output hints confirm that the function works as intended for all elements at odd indices. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
