Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and demonstrate the function's behavior as expected. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element is odd. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. The function handles the edge case of an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements by returning `True`, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the final assessment remains `True`.
