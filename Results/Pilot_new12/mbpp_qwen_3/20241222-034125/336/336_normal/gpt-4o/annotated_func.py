#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with a length less than 2 or all elements with even indices (1-based) are odd.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if all elements at odd indices (1-based) are odd numbers. Otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element is odd. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with fewer than two elements, which would result in the function returning `True` since the condition is trivially satisfied.
