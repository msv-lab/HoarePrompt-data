#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, and the function does not return False. This means that for every odd index `i`, the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` does not hold true.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is not even. If it finds any odd index where the element is even, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an index, the function returns `True`.

- The function iterates over the list `lst` using a for loop, checking each element at odd indices (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` is true for any odd index `i`, the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `lst` is empty. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `True` since the condition inside the loop never gets executed.
- The function assumes that the input is a list of integers, but it does not perform type checking to ensure that all elements in `lst` are indeed integers. If non-integer values are present, the function may raise a `TypeError`.

Final state of the program after it concludes:
- If the function returns `True`, it means that for every odd index in the list `lst`, the element at that index is not even.
- If the function returns `False`, it means that there exists at least one odd index in the list `lst` where the element is even.
