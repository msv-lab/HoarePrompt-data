Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least one integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Either `i % 2 == 0` or `lst[i] % 2 != 0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of the length of `lst`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(lst)`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Condition to Continue the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(lst)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < len(lst)` is satisfied, and the loop can proceed to the next iteration.

5. **Update Values for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will increment `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - The new value of `i` should be 1.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `lst` remains unchanged.
   - No other specific conditions or constraints are mentioned for `lst` other than it having at least one integer.

7. **New State:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least one integer (unchanged).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - The condition `i % 2 == 0` does not apply anymore since `i` is odd (1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `i` is 1**.
