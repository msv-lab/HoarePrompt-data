State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Initialization of `i`:** The variable `i` will start from 0 as per the `range(len(lst))`.
2. **Length of `lst`:** The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`. Therefore, `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute even once.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to ensure that `lst` has at least one integer.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, `i` is 0**
