Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the function should check whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, the current implementation of the function returns `False` as soon as it finds an even number at an odd index, which is not consistent with the requirement. 

To meet the problem description, the function should iterate through the list and verify that every odd index contains an odd number. If the function finds any odd index with an even number, it should return `False`. Otherwise, it should return `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over odd indices starting from 1
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number at the odd index is even
            return False
    return True  # All odd indices contain odd numbers
```

This corrected function will correctly check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number, adhering to the problem description.
