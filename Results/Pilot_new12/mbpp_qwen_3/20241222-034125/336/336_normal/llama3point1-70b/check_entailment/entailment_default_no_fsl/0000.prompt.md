You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is not even. If it finds any odd index where the element is even, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an index, the function returns `True`.

- The function iterates over the list `lst` using a for loop, checking each element at odd indices (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` is true for any odd index `i`, the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `lst` is empty. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `True` since the condition inside the loop never gets executed.
- The function assumes that the input is a list of integers, but it does not perform type checking to ensure that all elements in `lst` are indeed integers. If non-integer values are present, the function may raise a `TypeError`.

Final state of the program after it concludes:
- If the function returns `True`, it means that for every odd index in the list `lst`, the element at that index is not even.
- If the function returns `False`, it means that there exists at least one odd index in the list `lst` where the element is even.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
