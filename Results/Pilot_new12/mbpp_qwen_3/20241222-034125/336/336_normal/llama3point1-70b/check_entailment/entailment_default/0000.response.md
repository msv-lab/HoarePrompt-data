Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `True` since the loop never executes, and the condition inside the loop never gets checked. Additionally, while the code checks if the elements at odd indices are not even, it does not explicitly handle the case where the list has an even number of elements. However, the main issue is the handling of an empty list, which makes the program incorrect according to the problem description.
