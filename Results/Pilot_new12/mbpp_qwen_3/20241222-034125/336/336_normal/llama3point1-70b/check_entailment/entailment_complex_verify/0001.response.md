Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number, it does not handle edge cases such as an empty list or lists containing non-integer values. According to the problem description, the function should check if every odd index contains an odd number, and the original assessment did not account for these potential issues. Specifically:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the function incorrectly returns `True`, which does not align with the problem description that should indicate the absence of odd-indexed elements or their values.

2. **Type Checking**: The function does not perform any type checking to ensure that all elements in the list are integers. If the list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a `TypeError` during the execution of `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Given these points, the original assessment of the function being correct is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the refined assessment is that the function is **False**.
