Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `True` because the loop would never execute, and no condition would be checked. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` for an empty list since there are no odd indices to check. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
