Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` seems to meet the problem description, the original assessment incorrectly assumed that the function handles all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where the input list `lst` is empty. When the list is empty, the function incorrectly returns `True`, as there are no odd indices to check. Additionally, the function does not perform type checking to ensure that all elements in the list are integers, which could lead to a `TypeError` if non-integer values are present. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect these issues.
