Final: **False**

Reasoning: While the provided program `func_1` mostly implements the required functionality, it has a significant issue: it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, if the list is empty, the function will incorrectly return `True`, which is not in line with the intended behavior. Additionally, although the program does not explicitly check the types of the elements in the list, this is not the primary issue here. The main concern is the handling of the empty list case. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct is not accurate due to this oversight.
