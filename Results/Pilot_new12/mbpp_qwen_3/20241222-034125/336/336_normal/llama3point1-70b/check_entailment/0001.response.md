Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the given list and checks if every odd index contains an odd number. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Given the problem description, the function appears to meet the requirement. Here's a brief verification:

- For an empty list, the function should return `True` because there are no elements to check.
- For a list with only one element (which is at an odd index), the function should return `True` if that element is odd, and `False` if it is even.
- For a list with multiple elements, the function correctly checks each odd-indexed position for odd values.

Since the function seems to handle all described cases correctly without missing any logic or edge cases, the correctness is **True**.
