You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Since the logic correctly implements the requirement, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is not even. If it finds any odd index where the element is even, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such an index, the function returns `True`.

- The function iterates over the list `lst` using a for loop, checking each element at odd indices (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` is true for any odd index `i`, the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `lst` is empty. In such a scenario, the function would incorrectly return `True` since the condition inside the loop never gets executed.
- The function assumes that the input is a list of integers, but it does not perform type checking to ensure that all elements in `lst` are indeed integers. If non-integer values are present, the function may raise a `TypeError`.

Final state of the program after it concludes:
- If the function returns `True`, it means that for every odd index in the list `lst`, the element at that index is not even.
- If the function returns `False`, it means that there exists at least one odd index in the list `lst` where the element is even.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
