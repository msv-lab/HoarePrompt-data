Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Since the logic correctly implements the requirement, the program is correct for all potential cases.
