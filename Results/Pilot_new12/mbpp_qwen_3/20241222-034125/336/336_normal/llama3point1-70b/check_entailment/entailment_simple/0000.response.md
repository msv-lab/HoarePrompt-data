Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Loop through the List**: The function iterates over each index `i` of the list using a `for` loop. The `range(len(lst))` ensures that the loop runs from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.

2. **Check Odd Indexes**: Inside the loop, the condition `if i % 2 != 0` ensures that only odd indices (where `i` is an odd number) are checked. For even indices (`i % 2 == 0`), the condition is skipped.

3. **Verify Odd Values at Odd Indices**: The inner condition `and lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks whether the value at the current odd index is even. If any such index has an even value, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Return True if All Conditions Hold**: If the loop completes without finding any even value at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

### Case Analysis:

- **Case 1: List with all odd values at odd indices**
  - Example: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`
  - The function will iterate and check each odd index (1 and 3). Since both values are odd, the function returns `True`.

- **Case 2: List with an even value at an odd index**
  - Example: `[1, 2, 5, 7]`
  - The function will find the even value `2` at index `1` (an odd index) and return `False`.

- **Case 3: Empty List**
  - Example: `[]`
  - The loop does not execute, and no index is checked. By default, the function returns `True` because there are no even values at odd indices.

Given these points, the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
