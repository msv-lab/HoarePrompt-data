#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level).
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is either empty or contains no more elements that are lists, `flat_list` is a flattened version of the original `nested_list` including all integers and the flattened contents of any nested lists, `nested_list` is the original list before any modifications.
    return flat_list
    #`The program returns flat_list which is a flattened version of the original nested_list including all integers and the flattened contents of any nested lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level). It recursively flattens the `nested_list` into a single-level list `flat_list` that includes all integers and the contents of any nested lists. The function returns `flat_list`. Potential edge cases include handling an empty `nested_list` or a `nested_list` that only contains non-list elements. The function correctly handles these cases by returning an empty `flat_list` when necessary.
