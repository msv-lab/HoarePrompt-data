The code initializes an empty list named `flat_list`. The initial state of `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), but no changes are made to `nested_list` or `flat_list` by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `flat_list` variable.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
