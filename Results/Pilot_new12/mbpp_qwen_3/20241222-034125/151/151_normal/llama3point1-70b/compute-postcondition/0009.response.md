The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`. It only mentions that `nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list. This means `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. 

Therefore, after executing the code, `i` will be appended to `flat_list`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list; `flat_list` contains all elements from the original list except the first element, plus the first element of `nested_list`.**
