According to the given code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `nested_list` contains at least one element.
- If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list`.
- Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list` appended to it.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as `nested_list` contains at least one element.
2. After processing the first element, `nested_list` will no longer contain that first element.

Given that the loop has just finished its previous iteration, it means that the first element of `nested_list` was processed. Therefore, `nested_list` will now contain all elements except the first one (assuming it contained only one element before).

So, at the start of the next iteration:

- `nested_list` will have at least one element (since it had at least one element before, and the first element was processed).
- The first element of `nested_list` will be the next element in the original list.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list.**
