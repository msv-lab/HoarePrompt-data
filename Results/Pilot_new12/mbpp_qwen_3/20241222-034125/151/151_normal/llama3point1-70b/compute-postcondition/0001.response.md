To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself:

- **State before the loop starts**: 
  - `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level).
  - `flat_list` is an empty list.

- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for i in nested_list:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `nested_list`**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`.
   - For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element. This ensures there is something to iterate over.

2. **Variable `flat_list`**:
   - While `flat_list` is mentioned, its state (being empty) does not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `nested_list` contains elements.

3. **Variable `i`**:
   - In the loop, `i` represents the current element being processed in `nested_list`.
   - Since we are iterating through `nested_list`, the first element `i` in the first iteration will be the first item in `nested_list`.

### Conclusion:

The critical variable for ensuring the loop executes is `nested_list`. It must contain at least one element for the loop to run. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute is that `nested_list` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element**
