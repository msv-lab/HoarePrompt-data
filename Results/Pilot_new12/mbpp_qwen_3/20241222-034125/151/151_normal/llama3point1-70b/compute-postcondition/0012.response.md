The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` will extend the `flat_list` with the elements returned by the function `func_1(i)`. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state and no specific value for `i` is given, we cannot determine the exact elements added to `flat_list`. But we know that `flat_list` will include all the elements returned by `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the `nested_list`.

Since `nested_list` contains at least one element and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list, let's denote the first element of `nested_list` as `i`. After executing the code, `flat_list` will include the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, the first element is the next element from the original list, and `flat_list` includes all the elements returned by `func_1(i)` for each `i` in `nested_list`.**
