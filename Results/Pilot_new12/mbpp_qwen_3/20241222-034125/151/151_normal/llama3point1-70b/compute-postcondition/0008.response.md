`flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`. The value of `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, but the elements returned by `func_1(i)` are added to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list; `flat_list` is updated with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`**
