`flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is the first element of `nested_list`) to `flat_list`. The first element of `nested_list` is not a list, so appending it directly to `flat_list` will add that element to `flat_list`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element, and the type of the first element in `nested_list` is not a list; `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list` appended to it.**
