Postcondition: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, where the first element is either the next element from the original list or the remaining elements after processing. `flat_list` includes all elements processed from `nested_list` according to the following rules: if the current element `i` is a list, `func_1(i)` is applied to flatten it; if the current element `i` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.**
