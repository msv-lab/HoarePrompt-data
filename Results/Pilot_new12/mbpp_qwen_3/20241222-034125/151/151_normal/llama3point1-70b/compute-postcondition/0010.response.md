Postcondition: ***`nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list; `flat_list` is updated with either the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if the first element of `nested_list` is a list, or with all elements from the original list except the first element, plus the first element of `nested_list`.***
