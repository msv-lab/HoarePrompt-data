Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nested_list` contains at least one element.
   - The first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list.
   - `flat_list` is updated with either the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if the first element of `nested_list` is a list, or with all elements from the original list except the first element, plus the first element of `nested_list`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in nested_list:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed the first element of `nested_list`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since we have processed the first element, the first element of `nested_list` will now be the second element of the original list (or whatever was returned by `func_1(i)`).

5. **Updated States**:
   - `nested_list` will be modified such that its first element is the next element from the original list.
   - `flat_list` may have been updated depending on the processing done in the loop body, but we don't have specific details about what happens inside the loop.

6. **Final State**:
   - `nested_list` must still contain at least one element.
   - The first element of `nested_list` will be the next element from the original list.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list; `flat_list` is updated as per the processing done in the loop body.** 

Since we don't have specific details about how `flat_list` is updated, we can keep it general as "updated as per the processing done in the loop body".

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list; `flat_list` is updated as per the processing done in the loop body.**
