The code snippet `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. The initial state is that `nested_list` contains at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` is the next element from the original list. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list`, appending it to `flat_list` means `flat_list` will now contain this value.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains the remaining elements (if any) from its original state, and the first element is removed; `flat_list` contains all elements from the original `nested_list` plus the newly appended value of `i`.**
