The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the results of `func_1(i)`. The `nested_list` precondition states that its first element is a list, and the rest of the elements retain their original states. However, the specific values or contents of `nested_list`'s elements, except for the first one being a list, are not provided.

Given this, we know that the first element of `nested_list` is a list, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`.

Since the exact values of `i` and the content of `nested_list` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of `flat_list`. We only know that `flat_list` is now extended with the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list`'s first element is a list, and all other elements retain their original states; `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`**
