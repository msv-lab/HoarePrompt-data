Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively processes each element in the `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it calls itself recursively to further flatten that sublist. If an element is not a list, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. The function handles all potential cases, including nested lists of any depth, empty lists, and lists that contain only non-list elements. Given the recursive nature of the function, it can handle any level of nesting without issues, and it returns the flattened list as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
