Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element in the input list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of their depth, are flattened into a single list.

Since the function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and types (only lists and non-list items), it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
