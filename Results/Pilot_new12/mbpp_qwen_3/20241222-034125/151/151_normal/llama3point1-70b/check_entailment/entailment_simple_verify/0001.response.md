Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different stages, indicating that the function indeed processes the input `nested_list` and returns a flattened list `flat_list`. 

The function recursively handles nested lists of any depth, ensuring that all elements are eventually appended to `flat_list`. The provided explanation and the annotated version confirm that the function works as intended according to the problem description, thus maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
