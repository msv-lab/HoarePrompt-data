Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The annotations confirm that the function handles nested lists of any depth and types, ensuring that all elements are included in the final flattened list. The function returns an empty list when the input is empty or contains only non-list elements, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment of its correctness is valid.
