Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively handling each element. The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases, including nested lists of arbitrary depth, empty lists, and lists containing only non-list elements. The function returns an empty list in appropriate edge cases, ensuring that it meets the problem description and behaves as expected across all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
