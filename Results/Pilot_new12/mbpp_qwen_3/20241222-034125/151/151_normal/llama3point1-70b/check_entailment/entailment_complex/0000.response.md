Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level). This matches the requirement that the function should accept a nested list structure.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle nested lists. If an element in `nested_list` is itself a list, the function calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to further flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - **Empty List**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function will also return an empty `flat_list`, as there are no elements to process.
   - **Non-List Elements**: The function correctly processes both integer elements and nested lists, ensuring that all integers are included in the final flattened list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of the original `nested_list` including all integers and the contents of any nested lists.

Since the function recursively processes the entire `nested_list`, including all levels of nesting, and returns a flattened list, it fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
