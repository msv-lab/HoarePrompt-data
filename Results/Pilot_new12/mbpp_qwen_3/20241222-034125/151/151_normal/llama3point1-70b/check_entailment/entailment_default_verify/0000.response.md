Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively checking each element and appending it to the `flat_list`. The output hints confirm that the function handles potential edge cases such as an empty `nested_list` or a `nested_list` containing only non-list elements by returning an empty `flat_list` when necessary. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
