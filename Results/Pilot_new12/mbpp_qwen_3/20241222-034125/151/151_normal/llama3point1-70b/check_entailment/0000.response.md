Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element of the input list. If an element is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are included in the final flattened list. There are no potential edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.
