Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly flattens a given nested list structure. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level), as described in the problem statement.
2. It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened result.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. For each element:
   - If `i` is a list, the function recursively calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten the nested list and extends `flat_list` with the result.
   - If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` directly to `flat_list`.
4. After the loop completes, `flat_list` contains all integers and the flattened contents of any nested lists.
5. The function returns `flat_list`, which is the required flattened version of the original `nested_list`.

Given the recursive nature of the function and the logic inside the loop, the program will correctly handle lists of arbitrary depth and produce a single, flat list containing all integers from the nested structure. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
