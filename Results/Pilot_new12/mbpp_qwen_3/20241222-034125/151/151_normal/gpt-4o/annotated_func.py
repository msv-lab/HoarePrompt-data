#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) of integers.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is either empty or does not contain any nested lists, `flat_list` contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` and any nested lists that were recursively processed using `func_1`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` and any nested lists that were recursively processed using `func_1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all the integers from the original nested list, including those from any nested sublists processed recursively. The function ensures that the returned list does not contain any non-integer elements and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists that do not contain any integers or nested lists.
