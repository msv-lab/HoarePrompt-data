The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all the integers from the original nested list, including those from any nested sublists processed recursively. The function ensures that the returned list does not contain any non-integer elements and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists that do not contain any integers or nested lists.
