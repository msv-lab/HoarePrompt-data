Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure as described in the problem statement. The function uses recursion to process each item in the list, appending non-list items directly to the flat list and extending the flat list with the result of processing list items. The provided output hints confirm that the function processes nested lists correctly and ensures that the returned list does not contain any non-integer elements. The test cases cover various scenarios, including lists containing sublists of varying depths and lengths, and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation does not handle, making the original assessment of correctness true.
