Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a single list containing all the integers from the original nested list. The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle nested lists and appends non-list items directly to the `flat_list`. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function processes all elements correctly, including handling nested sublists recursively. All provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
