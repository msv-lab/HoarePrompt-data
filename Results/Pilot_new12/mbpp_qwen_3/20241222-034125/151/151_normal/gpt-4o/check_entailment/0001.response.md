Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively processes each element of the input list, checking if an element is a list itself. If it is, the function calls itself with that sublist, effectively flattening it. If an element is not a list, it is appended directly to the `flat_list`. The function handles various cases, including nested lists of varying depths and lengths. Given the provided test cases and the nature of the recursive approach, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
