Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a single-level list. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) of integers. This matches the problem description.

2. **Recursive Flattening Logic**:
   - The function uses a recursive approach to flatten the nested list. It iterates over each item in `nested_list`. If an item is a list, it calls itself (`func_1`) recursively to flatten the sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If an item is not a list (i.e., an integer), it appends the item directly to `flat_list`.
   - This ensures that all elements, whether they are at the top level or nested within sublists, are added to `flat_list`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When a non-list item is encountered, it is simply appended to `flat_list`. This handles the base case where the items are not nested lists.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the `flat_list` which contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` and any nested lists that were recursively processed.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover various scenarios including nested lists of different depths and lengths. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring that all elements are flattened into a single list.

Given this analysis, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement, making it correct.
