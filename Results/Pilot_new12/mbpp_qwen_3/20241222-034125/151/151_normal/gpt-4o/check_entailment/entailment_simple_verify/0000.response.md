Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` flattens a nested list structure. The annotated version of the code provides clear states at different points in the program, confirming that the function works as intended. 

- Before the function call, `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested lists) of integers.
- After the for loop, `nested_list` is either empty or does not contain any nested lists, and `flat_list` contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` and any nested lists that were recursively processed using `func_1`.
- The function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the integers from the original nested list structure.

Given the problem description and the annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly flattens the nested list structure as required. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
