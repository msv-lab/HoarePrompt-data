Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a single-level list. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires writing a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a nested list (`nested_list`) as input and returns a flattened list containing all the integers from the original nested list, including those from any nested sublists processed recursively.
3. **Implementation**:
   - The function uses a recursive approach to process each item in the `nested_list`. If an item is a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten the nested list.
   - Non-list items (integers) are directly appended to the `flat_list`.
   - The function ensures that only integers are included in the final `flat_list`.

Given the provided assertions and the explanation of the function, the program correctly implements the described functionality. It handles nested lists of varying depths and ensures that the output is a flattened list containing only integers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
