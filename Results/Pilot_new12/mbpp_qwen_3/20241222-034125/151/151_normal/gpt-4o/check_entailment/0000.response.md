Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It recursively processes each item in the list, appending non-list items directly to the flat list and extending the flat list with the result of processing list items. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists containing sublists of varying depths and lengths, and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation does not handle.
