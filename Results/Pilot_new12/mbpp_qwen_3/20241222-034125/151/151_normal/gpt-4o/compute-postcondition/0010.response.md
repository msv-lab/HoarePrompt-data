Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least one item for the loop to execute again; `flat_list` is updated to include either the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list` if `item` is a list, or all previous items plus the current `item` from `nested_list` if `item` is not a list.**
