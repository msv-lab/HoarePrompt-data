Output State: **`nested_list` is either empty or does not contain any nested lists, `flat_list` contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` and any nested lists that were recursively processed using `func_1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`nested_list`**: The loop continues to process elements of `nested_list` until there are no more nested lists to process. If `nested_list` initially contains only integers, it will remain unchanged. If it contains nested lists, those lists will be recursively processed and their contents added to `flat_list`.
- **`flat_list`**: This list accumulates all the integers found within `nested_list`, including those from any nested lists processed using `func_1`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `nested_list` will either be empty (if all nested lists have been processed) or will not contain any nested lists (if they were all processed). `flat_list` will contain all the integers that were originally in `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed using `func_1`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `nested_list` is empty or does not contain any lists), both `nested_list` and `flat_list` will retain their initial states.
