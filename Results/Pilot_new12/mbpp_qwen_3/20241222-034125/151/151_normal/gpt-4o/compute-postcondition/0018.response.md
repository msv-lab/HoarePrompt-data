Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all the integers from the original nested list, including those from any nested sublists processed recursively. The function ensures that the returned list does not contain any non-integer elements and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists that do not contain any integers or nested lists.**

- The function processes each element in the input `nested_list`. If an element is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively to process this sublist and then extends the `flat_list` with the results.
- If an element is an integer, it is directly appended to the `flat_list`.
- The function returns the `flat_list` which is guaranteed to be a list of integers, potentially including results from multiple recursive calls.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- If the input `nested_list` contains no integers or nested lists, the function still returns an empty list.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations mention that the function should handle the state where `nested_list` is either empty or does not contain any nested lists. However, the code itself correctly handles these cases by returning an empty list in both scenarios, so no additional functionality is needed.
