The code initializes an empty list called `flat_list`. This does not affect the contents of `nested_list`, which remains a list that may contain integers or other lists of integers. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists of integers; `flat_list` is an empty list**
