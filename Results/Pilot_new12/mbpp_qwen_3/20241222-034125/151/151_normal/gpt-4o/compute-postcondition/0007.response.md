According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nested_list`. The loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains the remaining items after the first item was processed.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, the first item of `nested_list` was processed according to the rules described.
2. The loop will continue as long as there are items left in `nested_list`.

Given that the first item was processed, the remaining items in `nested_list` must still be a list of items that the loop can iterate over.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains the remaining items after the first item was processed, and it must contain at least one item for the loop to execute again.**

To be more precise, if the first item was a list, it was extended into `flat_list` using `func_1`. If it was not a list, it was added directly to `flat_list`. In either case, the loop needs at least one more item to process.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least one item for the loop to execute again.**
