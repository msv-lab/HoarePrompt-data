Postcondition: **`nested_list` must contain at least one item for the loop to execute again. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is updated based on the extension of `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`. If `item` is not a list, `nested_list` contains items not yet processed, and `flat_list` is updated with the current `item`; this process continues until `nested_list` is empty.**
