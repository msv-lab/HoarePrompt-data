`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` contains at least one item, this means that `func_1(item)` will be called at least once and the results will be added to `flat_list`. However, the specific values of `func_1(item)` and the initial state of `flat_list` are not provided, so we can only say that `flat_list` is updated by extending itself with the output of `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one item for the loop to execute again, `flat_list` is updated based on the extension of `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`.**
