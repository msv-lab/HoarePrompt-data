According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nested_list`. The loop will execute if `nested_list` contains at least one item. 

Before the loop starts, `flat_list` is an empty list, and `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists of integers. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one item.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `nested_list` must contain at least one item (either an integer or another list).
- `flat_list` remains an empty list as it is not modified within the given snippet of the loop.

So, the final state should be:

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one item, `flat_list` is an empty list**
