`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`. The function `func_1` is applied to each item in `nested_list`, and the results are added to `flat_list`. However, since the exact values of `nested_list` and the output of `func_1` are not specified, we can only say that `flat_list` now includes these extended elements.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least one item for the loop to execute again; `flat_list` is updated to include the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`.**
