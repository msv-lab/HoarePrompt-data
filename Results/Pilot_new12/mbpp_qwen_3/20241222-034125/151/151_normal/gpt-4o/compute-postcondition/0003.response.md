`flat_list` extends by the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is a list from `nested_list`. Since `flat_list` was initially empty, after extending it with the result of `func_1(item)`, `flat_list` now contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. The `nested_list` loses the first item (which was a list) and now contains the rest of its items. The output state is: `nested_list` is the original nested list without its first item; `flat_list` is the result of extending with `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is the original nested list without its first item; `flat_list` is the result of extending with `func_1(item)`**
