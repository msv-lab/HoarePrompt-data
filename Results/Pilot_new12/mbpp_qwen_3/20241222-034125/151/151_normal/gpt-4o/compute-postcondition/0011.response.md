Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `nested_list` is a list that contains at least one item for the loop to execute again.
   - `flat_list` is updated to include either the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list` if `item` is a list, or all previous items plus the current `item` from `nested_list` if `item` is not a list.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`.
   - For each item, the loop body (`# the loop body is omitted`) is executed.
   - Depending on the type of the item (list or not), `flat_list` is updated accordingly.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least one item.
   - The state of `flat_list` depends on the operations performed within the loop, but since we don't have the specific details of the loop body, we focus on ensuring `nested_list` has at least one item.

4. **Considering the Update of `flat_list`:**
   - The exact content of `flat_list` after each iteration is dependent on the operations within the loop, but the key point is that `nested_list` must have at least one item for the loop to continue.

Given the above points, the primary state that needs adjustment is `nested_list`. We need to ensure it still contains at least one item for the loop to continue executing.

**State:**
- `nested_list` must contain at least one item for the loop to execute again.
- `flat_list` will be updated based on the operations within the loop, but the condition for the loop continuation is the presence of at least one item in `nested_list`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one item for the loop to execute again, `flat_list` is updated based on the loop body operations.**
