`flat_list` appends the first item from `nested_list`. Since the first item of `nested_list` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. The length of `flat_list` increases by 1, and `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one item (but the first item is not a list), `flat_list` contains one item which is the first item of `nested_list`, and the first item of `nested_list` is not a list.**
