Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension. The function handles cases where the input tuples have different lengths by truncating the longer tuple to match the length of the shorter one. If either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the resulting tuple will have the same length as the shorter tuple.
- If either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no obvious missing functionalities in the provided code. The code correctly implements the described behavior for all valid input cases.
