The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are tuples. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension. The function handles cases where the input tuples have different lengths by truncating the longer tuple to match the length of the shorter one. If either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.
