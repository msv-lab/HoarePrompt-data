Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operator on the elements of the tuples instead of performing element-wise extraction as required by the problem description. The annotated version correctly identifies that the function returns a tuple containing the element-wise logical AND of `tup1` and `tup2`, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment of False is correct.
