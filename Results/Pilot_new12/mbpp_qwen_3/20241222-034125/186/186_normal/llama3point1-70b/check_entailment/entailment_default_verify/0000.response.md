Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation using the `&` operator, which is not the intended operation based on the problem description. The problem description asks to extract elements from the given two tuples, implying a simple element-wise extraction rather than a bitwise operation. The provided output hints suggest that the function is supposed to return a new tuple with elements resulting from a logical AND operation, which is not what the current implementation does. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
