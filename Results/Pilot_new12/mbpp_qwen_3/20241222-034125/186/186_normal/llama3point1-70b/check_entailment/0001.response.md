Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operator on the elements of the tuples instead of performing element-wise extraction. According to the problem description, the function should extract elements from the given tuples and return them as a tuple. However, the current implementation performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not what the problem description asks for.

For example, consider the input tuples `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`. The expected output would be `(1, 2)` since we are supposed to extract the elements directly. However, the function will return `(0, 0)` because `1 & 3` is `1` and `2 & 4` is `0`.

To correct this, the function should simply return the result of `zip(tup1, tup2)` without applying any bitwise operations:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This corrected version will meet the requirements of the problem description.
