Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem description asks to extract elements and tuples from the given two tuples, which typically means returning a tuple of tuples containing pairs of elements from the input tuples. However, the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns a single tuple of results.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)`
- `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`

The expected output would be `((1 & 4), (2 & 5), (3 & 6)) = (0, 0, 0)`, but the code would return `(0, 0, 0)` as a single tuple.

To correctly implement the problem description, the function should return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the elements from the corresponding positions in the input tuples. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x, y) for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This corrected function will return the expected output, such as `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))` for the given example inputs.
