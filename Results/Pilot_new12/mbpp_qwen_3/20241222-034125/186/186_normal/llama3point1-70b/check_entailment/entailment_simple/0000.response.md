Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as inputs. It uses a generator expression inside a `tuple` constructor to compute the element-wise logical AND of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function then returns this resulting tuple.

The problem description asks for a function that extracts the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. The function `func_1` indeed performs an element-wise logical AND operation between the elements of the two input tuples and returns the result as a tuple. This matches the problem description exactly.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
