Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between elements of two tuples using a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor. However, this approach will not work as intended because the `&` operator is used for bitwise operations, which may lead to unexpected results for non-integer values. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the input tuples are not of equal length, which would cause a `zip` error.

For example, consider the following input:
```
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)
```
In this case, the program will raise a `zip` error because the tuples are of different lengths. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
