Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the logical AND operator (`and`). For example, if `tup1 = (True, False)` and `tup2 = (False, True)`, the expected output would be `(False, False)` because the logical AND operation would evaluate `True and False` and `False and True` as `False`. However, the bitwise AND operation evaluates `True & False` and `False & True` as `0` (which is equivalent to `False` in boolean context), and `0 & 1` as `0` (also equivalent to `False`), which is correct in this specific example.

However, consider another case where `tup1 = (1, 0)` and `tup2 = (0, 1)`. The expected logical AND output should be `(False, False)`, but the bitwise AND operation would return `(0, 0)`, which is not the expected logical AND result. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logical AND operation, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
