Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the element-wise logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. This is achieved using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension, which ensures that the returned tuple has elements resulting from the logical AND operation on matching indices of the input tuples.

The problem description specifies that the function should handle cases where the input tuples have different lengths by truncating the longer tuple to match the length of the shorter one. However, the annotated program does not explicitly mention this behavior, but it can be inferred from the use of `zip(tup1, tup2)`, which pairs elements from both tuples up to the length of the shorter tuple. Therefore, the program correctly implements the described functionality without any issues.
