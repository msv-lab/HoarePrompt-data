Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` currently performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples, which does not align with the problem description. The problem description requires the function to extract elements from the given tuples and return them as a tuple without any bitwise operations. The output hints further confirm this misunderstanding, as they state that the function returns the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is correct.
