Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples. This matches the problem description, which states that the function should extract the elementwise AND between the given two tuples.

The assertions provided also validate this behavior:
- For `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the binary representation of `10 & 5` is `0`, `4 & 2` is `0`, `6 & 3` is `2`, and `9 & 3` is `1`.
- For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the binary representation of `1 & 5` is `1`, `2 & 6` is `2`, `3 & 7` is `3`, and `4 & 8` is `0`.

Thus, the program correctly performs the required operation for all provided cases, making it compliant with the problem description.
