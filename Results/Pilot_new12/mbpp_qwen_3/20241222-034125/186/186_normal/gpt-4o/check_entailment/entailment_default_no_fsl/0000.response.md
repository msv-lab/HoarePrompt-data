Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem statement. It performs an element-wise logical AND operation between two tuples using the `zip` function and a generator expression. The function returns a new tuple containing the results of these operations. The provided test cases and output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly for the given examples and covers the described behavior, including handling tuples of different lengths by ignoring extra elements from the longer tuple. There are no apparent issues or missing cases based on the information provided.
