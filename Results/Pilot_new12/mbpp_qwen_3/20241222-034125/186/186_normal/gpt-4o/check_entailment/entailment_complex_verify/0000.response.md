Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The problem description asks to extract elements where the corresponding elements in the tuples are equal. However, the program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation on each pair of elements from the two tuples. As explained in the original assessment, this is not the same as checking for equality. For example, the function `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should return a tuple indicating the positions where the elements are equal, not the result of the bitwise AND operation. The annotated version confirms that the function performs a bitwise AND operation, which contradicts the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is maintained.
