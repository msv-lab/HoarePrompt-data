Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to apply the logical AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. However, the logical AND operation (`&`) is a bitwise operation, not a boolean comparison. This means that for non-zero values, the result will be non-zero, which does not align with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

For example, consider the following test case:
- `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
- The expected output should be the result of the logical AND operation on each pair of elements: `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3)` which gives `(8, 0, 6, 9)`.
- However, the current implementation will produce `(0, 0, 2, 1)` because the bitwise AND of `10 & 5` is `8`, `4 & 2` is `0`, `6 & 3` is `2`, and `9 & 3` is `1`.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the element-wise comparison as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
