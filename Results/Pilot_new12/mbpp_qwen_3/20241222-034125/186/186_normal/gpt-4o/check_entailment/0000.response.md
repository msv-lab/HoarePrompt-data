Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation on each pair of elements from the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract elements where the corresponding elements in the tuples are equal. The program instead performs a bitwise AND, which is not the same as checking for equality.

For example, consider the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The expected output would be a tuple containing `1` (since `10 & 5 = 01010 & 00101 = 00000`), `0` (since `4 & 2 = 0100 & 0010 = 0000`), `6` (since `6 & 3 = 0110 & 0011 = 0010`), and `9` (since `9 & 3 = 1001 & 0011 = 0001`). However, the program outputs `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.

To meet the problem description, the program should compare the elements for equality and return a tuple of indices where the elements are equal, rather than performing a bitwise AND operation.
