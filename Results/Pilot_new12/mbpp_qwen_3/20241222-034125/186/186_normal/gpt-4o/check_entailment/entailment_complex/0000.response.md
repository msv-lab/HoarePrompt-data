Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, as inputs and returns a new tuple containing the results of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples. 

- The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously.
- The logical AND operation (`&`) is performed on each pair of elements using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor.
- The resulting tuple contains the results of these operations, matching the requirement to extract the element-wise logical AND of the given tuples.

Since the function correctly performs the specified operation without any assumptions about invalid inputs (as per the given instructions), and the examples provided in the assertions align with the described behavior, the program is correct.
