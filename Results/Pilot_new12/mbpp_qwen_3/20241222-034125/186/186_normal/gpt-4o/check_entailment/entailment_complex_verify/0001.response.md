Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation on two tuples. The annotated version confirms that the function takes two tuples of the same length, performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements, and returns a new tuple with the results. The provided test cases confirm the function's correctness for the given inputs. Since the annotated version supports the correctness and there are no issues or edge cases identified, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.
