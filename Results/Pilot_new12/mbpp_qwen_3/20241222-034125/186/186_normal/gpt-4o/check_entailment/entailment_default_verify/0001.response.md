Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to perform the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of any length equally well, returning a new tuple with the results of the bitwise AND operations. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected and there is no indication of any edge cases or issues with the current implementation. Thus, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
