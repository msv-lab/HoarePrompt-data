Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should extract elements where the corresponding elements in the tuples are equal. However, the program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation instead of checking for equality. For example, the first test case `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)` should return a tuple indicating the positions where the elements are equal. The expected output is not provided, but the current implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is accurate.
