Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to compute the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the two input tuples. The function correctly returns a tuple with the results of these bitwise AND operations for the given test cases:

1. For `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the output `(0, 0, 2, 1)` is correct because:
   - \(10 \& 5 = 0\)
   - \(4 \& 2 = 0\)
   - \(6 \& 3 = 2\)
   - \(9 \& 3 = 1\)

2. For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`, the output `(1, 2, 3, 0)` is correct because:
   - \(1 \& 5 = 1\)
   - \(2 \& 6 = 2\)
   - \(3 \& 7 = 3\)
   - \(4 \& 8 = 0\)

3. For `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`, the output `(0, 9, 10, 0)` is correct because:
   - \(8 \& 7 = 0\)
   - \(9 \& 13 = 9\)
   - \(11 \& 14 = 10\)
   - \(12 \& 17 = 0\)

Given that the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic aligns with the problem description, there are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct.
