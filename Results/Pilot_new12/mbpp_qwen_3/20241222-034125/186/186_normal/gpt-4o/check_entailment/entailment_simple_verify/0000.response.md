Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to extract elements from the given tuples where the corresponding elements are equal. However, the annotated version clearly shows that the program performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples, rather than checking for equality. For example, the first assertion `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)` results in `(0, 0, 6, 9)`, which is not what the problem description requires. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
