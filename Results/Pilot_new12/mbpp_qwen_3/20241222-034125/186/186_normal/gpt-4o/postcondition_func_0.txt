The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation (`&`) between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The function handles tuples of any length, provided they are equal. If one tuple is longer than the other, the extra elements of the longer tuple are ignored. The function does not modify the original tuples; instead, it creates and returns a new tuple containing the logical AND results.
