#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples with the same length.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing elements that are the results of the logical AND operation between corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation (`&`) between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The function handles tuples of any length, provided they are equal. If one tuple is longer than the other, the extra elements of the longer tuple are ignored. The function does not modify the original tuples; instead, it creates and returns a new tuple containing the logical AND results.
