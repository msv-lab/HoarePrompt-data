The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples with the same length. The function returns a tuple containing elements that are the results of the logical AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tuple1 and tuple2, which are tuples of the same length, and returns a tuple containing the results of the logical AND operation between corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2.**
