#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary where each key-value pair (k, v) is included only if the value v is greater than or equal to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code, but generally, if `d` is empty or `n` is not provided, the function will still return an empty dictionary. No additional missing functionality is noted in the provided code.
