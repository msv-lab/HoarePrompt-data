Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by filtering the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function handles the case where the input dictionary `d` is empty, returning an empty dictionary as expected. Since no other edge cases were mentioned in the output hints and the provided implementation seems to cover all described requirements, the program is correct.
