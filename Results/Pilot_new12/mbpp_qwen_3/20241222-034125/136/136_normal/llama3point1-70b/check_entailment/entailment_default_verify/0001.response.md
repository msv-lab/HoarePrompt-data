Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of filtering a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning an empty dictionary if `d` is empty or `n` is not provided. Since the problem description and the code implementation match perfectly, and no additional issues are mentioned in the output hints, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
