Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` correctly filters the dictionary based on the condition, thus ensuring that only entries with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the returned dictionary. The program does not need to handle specific edge cases such as an empty dictionary or invalid inputs, as per the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
