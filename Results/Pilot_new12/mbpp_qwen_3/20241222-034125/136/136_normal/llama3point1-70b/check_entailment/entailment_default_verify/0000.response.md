Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the input dictionary `d` and includes only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning an empty dictionary in edge cases such as an empty input dictionary or no value for `n`. Since the program meets the requirements and there are no issues identified in the output hints, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
