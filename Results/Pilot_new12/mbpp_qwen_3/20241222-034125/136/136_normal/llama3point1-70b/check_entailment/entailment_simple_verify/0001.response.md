Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function correctly implements the required behavior for any valid dictionary and any integer `n`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
