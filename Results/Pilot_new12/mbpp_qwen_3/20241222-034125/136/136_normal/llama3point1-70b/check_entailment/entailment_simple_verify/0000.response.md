Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d` and includes only those pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This matches the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the program.
