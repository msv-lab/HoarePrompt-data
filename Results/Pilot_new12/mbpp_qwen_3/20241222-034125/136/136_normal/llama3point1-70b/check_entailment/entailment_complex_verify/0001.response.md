Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This exactly matches the problem description. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function returns a dictionary where each key-value pair `(k, v)` is included only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. The function handles the case where the input dictionary `d` is empty by returning an empty dictionary, which is a valid and expected behavior for such operations. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is supported by both the code and the annotated version.
