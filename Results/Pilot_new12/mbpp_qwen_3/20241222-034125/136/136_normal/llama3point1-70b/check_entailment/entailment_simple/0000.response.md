Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This behavior matches the problem description exactly. The dictionary comprehension used in the function ensures that only the desired key-value pairs are included in the returned dictionary. Therefore, the program is correct.
