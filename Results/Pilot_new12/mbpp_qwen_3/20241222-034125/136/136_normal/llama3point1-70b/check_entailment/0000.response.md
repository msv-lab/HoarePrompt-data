Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The dictionary comprehension iterates through each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d` and includes only those pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This implementation covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
