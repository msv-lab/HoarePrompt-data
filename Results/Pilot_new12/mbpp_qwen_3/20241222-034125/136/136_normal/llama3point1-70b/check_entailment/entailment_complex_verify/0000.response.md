Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function handles all valid inputs as per the problem description and the annotations do not indicate any missing functionality or incorrect behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
