Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The code uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this, which is efficient and concise. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that suggest the code fails for any potential case. The code handles an empty dictionary correctly by returning an empty dictionary, and it does not require additional handling for invalid inputs as per the given assumptions.
