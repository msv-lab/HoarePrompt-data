Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This exactly matches the problem description. Since the function correctly implements the required behavior for any dictionary and any integer `n`, there are no cases where this function would fail to meet the requirements.
