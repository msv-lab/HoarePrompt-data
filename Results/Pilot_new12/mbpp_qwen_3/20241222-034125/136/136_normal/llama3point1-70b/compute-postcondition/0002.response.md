Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code, but generally, if `d` is empty or `n` is not provided, the function will still return an empty dictionary. No additional missing functionality is noted in the provided code.**
