The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary where the values are integers, and `n`, which is an integer. The function returns a dictionary where each key-value pair (k, v) is included only if the value v is greater than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and return a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
