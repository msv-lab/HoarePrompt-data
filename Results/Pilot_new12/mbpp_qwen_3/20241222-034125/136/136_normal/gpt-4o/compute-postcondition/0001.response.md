The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary where the values are comparable, and `n`, which is an integer. The function returns a new dictionary where each key-value pair (k, v) from the original dictionary `d` is included only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with comparable values and an integer `n`, and returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.**
