The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with values that can be compared using `>=` and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that all entries with values less than `n` are removed from the dictionary. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will also be empty. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the code does not perform any missing functionality beyond what is described.
