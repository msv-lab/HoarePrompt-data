Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including dictionaries with multiple entries, dictionaries with fewer entries that meet the condition, and dictionaries with no entries meeting the condition. Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and the problem description and hints do not indicate any additional edge cases or missing functionality, the program is correct for every potential case.
