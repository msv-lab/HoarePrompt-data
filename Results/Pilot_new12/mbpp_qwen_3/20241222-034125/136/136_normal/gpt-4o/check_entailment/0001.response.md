Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions provided in the code snippet cover different scenarios, including cases where the threshold value is between the minimum and maximum values in the dictionary, and when the threshold value matches the maximum value. Since the function implementation matches the problem description for the given cases and no edge cases were identified that the code does not handle correctly, the program is correct.
