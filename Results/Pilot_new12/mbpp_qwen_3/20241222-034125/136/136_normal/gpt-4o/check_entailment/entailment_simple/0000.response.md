Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different dictionaries and thresholds (`n`). All the assertions pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected. Specifically:

- For `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170)`, the returned dictionary should include keys with values greater than or equal to 170, which matches the output `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
- For `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 180)`, the returned dictionary should include keys with values greater than or equal to 180, which matches the output `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
- For `func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 190)`, the returned dictionary should include keys with values greater than or equal to 190, which matches the output `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`.

Since the program correctly filters the dictionary based on the value threshold and all test cases pass, the program is correct according to the problem description.
