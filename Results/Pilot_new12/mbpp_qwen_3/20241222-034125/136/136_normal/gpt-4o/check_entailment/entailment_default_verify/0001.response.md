Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions cover various scenarios, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary with the required filtering. There are no edge cases mentioned that the code does not handle correctly, and the provided code and annotations align with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
