Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary with the appropriate key-value pairs. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned that would invalidate the original assessment. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios.
