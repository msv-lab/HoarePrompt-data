Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

- The function uses a dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` to filter the dictionary.
- The comprehension iterates over each item in the dictionary and includes it in the resulting dictionary if its value is greater than or equal to `n`.
- The provided assertions test various scenarios:
  - When `n = 170`, it should return keys with values 175, 180, and 190.
  - When `n = 180`, it should return keys with values 180 and 190.
  - When `n = 190`, it should return only the key with value 190.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided tests, the program is correct.
