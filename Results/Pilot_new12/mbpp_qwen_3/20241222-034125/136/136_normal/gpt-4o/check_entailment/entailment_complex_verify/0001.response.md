Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including cases where the threshold value is between the minimum and maximum values in the dictionary and when the threshold value matches the maximum value. No edge cases or missing functionalities were identified that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
