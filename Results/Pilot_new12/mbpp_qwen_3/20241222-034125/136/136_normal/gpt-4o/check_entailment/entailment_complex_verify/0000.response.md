Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotated version reinforces this by explicitly stating that the function returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given test cases. There are no contradictions or issues identified in the annotated version that would suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is maintained.
