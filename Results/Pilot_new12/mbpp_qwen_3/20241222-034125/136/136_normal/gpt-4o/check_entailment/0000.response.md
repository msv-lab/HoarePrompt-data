Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The examples provided demonstrate that the function works as intended:

- When `n` is 170, it returns `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
- When `n` is 180, it returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
- When `n` is 190, it returns `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`.

The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary, which is efficient and concise. Since the function handles the examples correctly and the logic appears sound, there are no potential cases found where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
