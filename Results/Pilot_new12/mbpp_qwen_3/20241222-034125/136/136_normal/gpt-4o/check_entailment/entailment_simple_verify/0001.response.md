Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including cases where the threshold value is between the minimum and maximum values in the dictionary, and when the threshold value matches the maximum value. The annotated version further clarifies that the input dictionary `d` contains values that can be compared using `>=`, and `n` is an integer, which aligns with the problem description and the function's implementation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
