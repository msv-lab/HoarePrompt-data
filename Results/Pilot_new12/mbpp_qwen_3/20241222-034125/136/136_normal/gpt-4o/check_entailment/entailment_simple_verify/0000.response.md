Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the state of the program and confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. The dictionary comprehension used in the function efficiently filters the dictionary based on the condition specified, and there is no evidence from the annotations suggesting any issues with the function's implementation. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
