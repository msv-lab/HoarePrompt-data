Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected: it returns `False` if any item in the list is not equal to the element, and `True` if all items are equal to the element. The provided test cases validate this behavior. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
