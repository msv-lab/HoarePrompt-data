Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it successfully iterates through the entire list without finding any such item, it returns `True`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function handles all the provided assertions correctly and works for every potential case within the given constraints.
