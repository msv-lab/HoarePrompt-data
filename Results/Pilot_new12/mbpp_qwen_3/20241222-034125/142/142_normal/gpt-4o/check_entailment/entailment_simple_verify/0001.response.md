Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear description of the states of the program at different points, which aligns with the logic of the function `func_1`. The function correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

- For the first assertion: `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` contains items that are not equal to `'blue'`, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- For the second assertion: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` contains items that are not equal to `7`, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- For the third assertion: `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` contains only items that are equal to `'green'`, so the function correctly returns `True`.

The annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended, checking each item in the list against the given element and returning `True` only if all items match. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
