Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` if any item does not match the element. If all items match the element, the function returns `True`. The provided test cases validate the function's behavior under different scenarios. The annotations also correctly describe the function's behavior, including the handling of an empty list, which does not affect the correctness since the function is designed to work with valid inputs as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
