Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a list and an element, and check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The function iterates through each item in the list using a for loop.
   - If any item is not equal to the given element, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to the given element, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases verify different scenarios:
- The first test case `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False` checks a list where all items are not equal to the given element.
- The second test case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False` checks a list where no items are equal to the given element.
- The third test case `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True` checks a list where all items are equal to the given element.

In each of these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
