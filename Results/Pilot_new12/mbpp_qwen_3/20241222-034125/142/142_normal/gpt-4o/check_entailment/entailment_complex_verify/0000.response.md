Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear description of the program's behavior, which aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate the function's expected behavior:

1. For the list `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` and the element `'blue'`, the function correctly returns `False` because not all items in the list are equal to `'blue'`.
2. For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the element `7`, the function correctly returns `False` because not all items in the list are equal to `7`.
3. For the list `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` and the element `'green'`, the function correctly returns `True` because all items in the list are equal to `'green'`.

The annotated version confirms that the function returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element, and it returns `True` only if all items in the list are equal to the given element. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
