Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) as inputs and checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Functionality Check**: 
   - The function iterates over each item in the list using a `for` loop.
   - It checks if each item is equal to the given element.
   - If any item is not equal to the element, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If all items are equal to the element, it returns `True`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')`: This should return `False` because not all items are 'blue'.
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)`: This should return `False` because none of the items are `7`.
     - `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')`: This should return `True` because all items are 'green'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - While the problem description assumes valid input, the function handles the edge case where the list might be empty. If the list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will implicitly return `True`, which is logically consistent with the requirement (an empty list can trivially satisfy the condition).

Since the function behaves as expected and covers the required scenarios, the program is correct according to the problem description.
