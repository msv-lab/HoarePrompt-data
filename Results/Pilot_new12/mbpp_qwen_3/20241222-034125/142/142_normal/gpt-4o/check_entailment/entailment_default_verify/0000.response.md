Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with no matching elements and lists where all elements match the given element. The function behaves as expected in these cases, and the logic is sound. The output hints also support this, indicating that the function correctly returns `False` if any item is not equal to the element and `True` if all items match the element. Since the function meets the problem description and behaves as expected, the original assessment of the program's correctness is correct.
