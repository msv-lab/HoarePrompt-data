The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to compare against all items in the list. The function returns False in two cases and None in one case, and True in another case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a value `element`, and return `False` if the element does not meet certain conditions, `None` if another specific condition is met, and `True` if a particular condition is satisfied.
