According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least one element, and the loop should proceed to the next item in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition was that `lst` is a list with at least one element, and the first item in the list is equal to `element`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the first item in the list must no longer be the current `item`, and there must still be at least one element left in the list.

Since the loop is iterating over each item in `lst`, after the first iteration, the first item will have been consumed or processed, and we move to the next item. Therefore, `lst` will still have at least one element, but it will be the second item in the original list.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `lst` must still have at least one element.
- The first item in `lst` (which was previously `element`) is no longer the first item.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least two elements, and the first item in the list is not equal to `element`**
