Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It iterates through each item in the list `lst` and checks if the item is not equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such item, the function returns `True`. The function also returns `None` if the list `lst` is empty and the loop does not execute at all.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function returns `False` in all cases where any item in the list is not equal to `element`.
- The function returns `None` if the list `lst` is empty, meaning the loop does not execute.
- The function returns `True` only if all items in the list are equal to `element`.

No additional actions or edge cases are mentioned in the annotations that are not supported by the actual code.
