#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value to compare against all items in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list with at least one element, and every element in the list is equal to `element`. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `lst` is an empty list), the function does not return anything (None).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It iterates through each item in the list `lst` and checks if the item is not equal to `element`. If any item is found that is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such item, the function returns `True`. The function also returns `None` if the list `lst` is empty and the loop does not execute at all.
