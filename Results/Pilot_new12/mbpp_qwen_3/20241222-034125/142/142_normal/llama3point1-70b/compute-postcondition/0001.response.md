The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to compare against all items in the list. The function returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a value `element`, and return `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise return `False`.
