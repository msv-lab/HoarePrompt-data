Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element` using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if all items match the given element and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list correctly, where the `all()` function would return `True` because there are no elements that do not match the given element. There is no indication in the output hints that the program is missing any functionality or behaving incorrectly according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
