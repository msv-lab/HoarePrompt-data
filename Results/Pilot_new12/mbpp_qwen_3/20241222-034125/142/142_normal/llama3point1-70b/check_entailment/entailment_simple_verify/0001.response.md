Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function `func_1` returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`, and `False` otherwise. This directly aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided code and annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended, making the original assessment of correctness **True**.
