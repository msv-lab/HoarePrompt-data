Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the functionality described in the problem statement accurately. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an `element`, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true (or if the iterable is empty). If any item in the list does not match the given `element`, `all()` will immediately return `False`.

Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the code works correctly for every potential case. It handles an empty list by returning `True` (since there are no items that do not match the element), and it correctly identifies when all items in the list are equal to the given element. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that indicate the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
