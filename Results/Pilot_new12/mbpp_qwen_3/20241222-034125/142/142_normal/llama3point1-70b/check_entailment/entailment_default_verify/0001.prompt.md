You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). In this case, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each item in the list is equal to the given element. Therefore, `all()` will return `True` only if every item in the list is equal to the given element, which matches the problem description exactly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to compare against all items in the list. It returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list matches the given `element`. If any item in the list does not match `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If all items match `element`, it returns `True`. This means that the function checks the equality of each element in the list with the given `element` and returns the result based on the outcome of this comparison. Potential edge cases include an empty list `lst`, where the function still returns `True` because the condition is vacuously satisfied. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
