Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code correctly describes the behavior of the function. The function `func_1` uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The `all()` function will return `True` only if all elements in the generator expression evaluate to `True`, which means all elements in the list are equal to the given element. Conversely, if any element does not match, `all()` will return `False`. This implementation correctly meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
