Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases. The `all()` function returns `True` only if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) evaluate to `True`. For each element in the list, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` will yield `True` if the element matches the given `element`, and `False` otherwise. Since `all()` requires all elements to be `True` for the entire expression to evaluate to `True`, this function will correctly return `True` only if all elements in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would make this function incorrect.
