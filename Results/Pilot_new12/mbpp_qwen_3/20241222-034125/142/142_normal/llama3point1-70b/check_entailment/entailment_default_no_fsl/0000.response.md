Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the `all()` function ensures that the function returns `True` only if every item in the list matches the given element. The function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `True`, as there are no elements in the list to contradict the condition. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
