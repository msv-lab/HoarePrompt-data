Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The use of the `all()` function ensures that if any item in the list does not match the `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. Only if all items match the `element` does the function return `True`. The annotated version also correctly notes that an empty list will result in `True` because there are no items that do not match the `element`, which aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases or issues identified in the provided code that would cause it to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
