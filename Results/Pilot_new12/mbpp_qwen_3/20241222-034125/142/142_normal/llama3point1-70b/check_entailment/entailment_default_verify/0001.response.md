Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`), and uses the `all()` function to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise. There are no issues with the provided code that would cause it to fail based on the problem description, and the potential edge case of an empty list is handled appropriately by the `all()` function, which returns `True` for an empty iterable. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
