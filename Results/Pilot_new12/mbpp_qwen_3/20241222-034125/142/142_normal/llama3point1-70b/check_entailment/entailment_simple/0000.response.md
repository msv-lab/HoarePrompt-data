Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an `element` as inputs and uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. The expression `all(item == element for item in lst)` returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that the function should check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. Since the function behaves as intended under all valid cases (assuming valid input as per the given assumptions), the program is correct.
