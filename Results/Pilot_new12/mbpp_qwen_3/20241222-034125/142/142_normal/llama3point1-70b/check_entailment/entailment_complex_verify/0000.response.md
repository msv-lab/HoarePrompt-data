Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The use of the `all()` function combined with a generator expression ensures that the function returns `True` only if every item in the list matches the given element. The annotated version clearly supports this by explaining that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise. Additionally, the explanation covers potential edge cases, such as an empty list, correctly noting that the function returns `True` for an empty list because there are no items to contradict the condition. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
