Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). In this case, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each item in the list is equal to the given element. Therefore, `all()` will return `True` only if every item in the list is equal to the given element, which matches the problem description exactly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.
