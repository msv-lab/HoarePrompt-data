Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs. It uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to `element`. 

- If all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, the function returns `True`.
- If any item in the list `lst` is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`.

The explanation provided in the comments correctly describes the behavior of the function. It also mentions that the function handles an edge case where the list is empty, returning `True` because the condition is vacuously satisfied. No other edge cases or functionalities are required according to the problem description, and the provided function meets these requirements without any issues.

Therefore, the program is correct as per the problem description.
