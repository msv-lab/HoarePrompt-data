The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value to compare against all items in the list. It returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses the built-in `all()` function to check if every item in the list matches the given `element`. If any item in the list does not match `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If all items match `element`, it returns `True`. This means that the function checks the equality of each element in the list with the given `element` and returns the result based on the outcome of this comparison. Potential edge cases include an empty list `lst`, where the function still returns `True` because the condition is vacuously satisfied. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
