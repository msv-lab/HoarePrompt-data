Output State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `s`. If the function returns True during any iteration of the loop, it means that there exists at least one word in `words` that has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the middle part of the word. Otherwise, the function returns None.**
