`s` is a string, and `words` is assigned the value of `s.split()`. The `split()` method splits the string `s` into a list of substrings based on whitespace by default. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `s`**
