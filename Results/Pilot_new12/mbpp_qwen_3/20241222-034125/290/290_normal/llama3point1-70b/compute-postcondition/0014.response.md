Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter. It splits the string into a list of words and checks each word to determine if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the middle part of the word (i.e., excluding the first and last characters). If such a word is found, the function returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s` and only returns a boolean value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string `s` is empty, the function will split it into an empty list of words and return `False`.
- If the input string `s` consists of only one word and its length is 1 or less, the function will check if it contains the character 'z' in the middle part, which is impossible, and thus will return `False`.
- If none of the words in the string `s` meet the specified condition, the function will return `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided annotations suggest that the function could have multiple return statements for `True`, but the actual code only contains a single return statement for `True`. Therefore, the annotations might be misleading. The function should only return `True` once and then terminate, rather than potentially returning `True` multiple times.
