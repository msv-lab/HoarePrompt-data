Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, and `words` is a list of substrings from `s` that must have at least two elements, all elements in `words` have length less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the middle part of any element in `words`. If the length of any word in `words` is greater than 1 and 'z' is in the middle part of that word, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
