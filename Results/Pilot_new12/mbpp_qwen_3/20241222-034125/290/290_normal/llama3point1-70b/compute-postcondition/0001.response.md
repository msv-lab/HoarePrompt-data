According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `words`. The loop will execute if `words` is a non-empty list, meaning it contains at least one substring.

At the start of the loop, `s` is a string, but this alone does not guarantee that the loop will execute. The key factor is the list `words`, which is derived from `s`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `words` is a non-empty list. This means that `words` must contain at least one substring from `s`.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `s` that must have at least one element**
