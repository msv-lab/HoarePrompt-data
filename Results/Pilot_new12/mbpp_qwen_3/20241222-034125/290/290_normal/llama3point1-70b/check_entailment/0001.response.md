Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' at any position except the start and end of each word. The function splits the input string into words and then iterates through each word. For each word, it checks if the length is greater than 1 and if the character 'z' is present in the substring from the second character to the second last character of the word (`word[1:-1]`). If such a 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, after checking all words, it returns `False`. This logic accurately follows the problem description and works for all potential cases.
