Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if a string contains the character 'z' at any position except the start and end of each word. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input string, splits it into words, and then iterates through each word to check if it meets the specified condition. If such a 'z' is found in any word, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such 'z' is found after checking all words, the function correctly returns `False`. The logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
