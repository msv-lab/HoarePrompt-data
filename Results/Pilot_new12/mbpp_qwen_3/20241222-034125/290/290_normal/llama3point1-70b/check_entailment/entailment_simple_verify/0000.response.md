Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if any word in the input string `s` contains the character 'z' (excluding the start and end of the word). The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, ensuring that if any word meets the specified condition, the function returns `True`. If no such word is found, the function returns `False`. The annotations clearly support this behavior, and there is no evidence suggesting that the function does not meet the problem description.
