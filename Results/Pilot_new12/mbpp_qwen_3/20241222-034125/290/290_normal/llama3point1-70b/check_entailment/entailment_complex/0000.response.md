Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as input, which matches the expected input type.
2. **Splitting the String**: The function splits the input string `s` into a list of words using `s.split()`. This ensures that each word in the string is checked individually.
3. **Iterating Over Words**: For each word in the list of words, the function checks if the word has a length greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`) and if the character 'z' is present in the substring of the word excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`). This exactly matches the condition specified in the problem description.
4. **Returning the Result**: 
   - If a word meeting the criteria is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
   - If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check for the presence of 'z' in the middle of words (excluding the first and last characters) and handles the input as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
