Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the character 'z' (except at the start and end of the word) within each word of the input string. It splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, checking if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters. This logic ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all possible inputs.
