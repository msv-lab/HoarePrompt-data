Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The provided output hints confirm that the function splits the input string into words, checks each word's length and the presence of 'z' in the middle part, and returns the appropriate boolean value. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support this correctness, the original assessment is maintained as True.
