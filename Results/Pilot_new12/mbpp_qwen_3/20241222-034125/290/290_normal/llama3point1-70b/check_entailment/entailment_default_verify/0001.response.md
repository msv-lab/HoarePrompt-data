Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the function `func_1`. The function indeed checks if any word within the input string contains the character 'z' at any position except the start and end of the word. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The provided output hints also confirm this behavior, mentioning that the function splits the string into words, checks each word for the specified conditions, and returns a boolean value based on whether such a word exists. Therefore, there is no evidence from the provided information to change the original assessment.
