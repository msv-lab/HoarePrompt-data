Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the requirement to check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, checking if its length is greater than 1 and if it contains 'z' in the middle part of the word (excluding the first and last characters). If such a word is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This logic matches the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
