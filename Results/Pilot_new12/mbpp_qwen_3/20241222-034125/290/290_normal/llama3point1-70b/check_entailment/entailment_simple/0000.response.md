Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the input string `s` into words using `split()`, then iterates through each word. For each word with more than one character (i.e., `len(word) > 1`), it checks if the character 'z' appears in the substring of the word excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`). If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. This ensures that the function adheres to the requirement of checking if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
