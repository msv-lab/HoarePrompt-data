Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The annotated version confirms that the function splits the input string into words, checks each word to see if it contains 'z' in the middle part (excluding the first and last characters), and returns `True` if such a word is found. If no such word exists, it returns `False`. The annotations align with the function's behavior and the problem description, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
