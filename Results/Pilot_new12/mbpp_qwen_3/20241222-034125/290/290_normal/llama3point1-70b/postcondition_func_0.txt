The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter. It splits the string into a list of words and checks each word to determine if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the middle part of the word (i.e., excluding the first and last characters). If such a word is found, the function returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s` and only returns a boolean value.
