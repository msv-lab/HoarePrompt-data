The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It checks whether the character 'z' appears in the substring of `s` that starts from the second character to the second last character. If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers the following cases:
- If 'z' is present in the specified substring, the function returns `True`.
- If 'z' is not present in the specified substring, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle empty strings (`""`). If `s` is an empty string, the function would raise an error because `s[1:-1]` would result in an empty string and checking for 'z' in an empty string would fail. To handle this case, the function should either return `False` or add a check at the beginning to handle empty strings appropriately.
- The function does not handle strings where `s` is exactly two characters long. In such cases, `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string, and the function would incorrectly return `False`. To handle this case, the function should check if `s` is exactly two characters long and return `False` in that scenario.
