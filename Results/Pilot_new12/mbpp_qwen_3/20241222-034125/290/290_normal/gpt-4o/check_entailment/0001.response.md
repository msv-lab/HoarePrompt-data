Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where 'z' appears at positions other than the start or end of the string. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string. However, the problem description states that 'z' should not appear at the start and end of the word, but it does not specify that 'z' cannot be part of a longer sequence that includes the first or last character of the string.

For example, consider the string `'pzxyz'`. According to the problem description, this string should return `False` because 'z' appears in the middle (not at the start or end). However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `True` because 'z' is found within the substring `s[1:-1]`.

To fix this, the function should check if 'z' is present anywhere in the string except the first and last characters. This can be achieved by checking if 'z' is in the substring `s[1:-1]` and also ensuring that 'z' is not the first or last character of the string. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    # Check if 'z' is in the substring excluding the first and last characters
    # and ensure 'z' is not the first or last character
    return 'z' in s[1:-1] and s[0] != 'z' and s[-1] != 'z'

# Test cases
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False
assert func_1('pzxyz') == False  # This should now return False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description.
