Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input string is empty or exactly two characters long. According to the problem description, the function should check if the string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. For an empty string or a string with exactly two characters, the condition `'z' in s[1:-1]` will result in an empty string, and the function will incorrectly return `False`.

To fix this, the function should include a check at the beginning to handle these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if len(s) <= 2:
        return False
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

This ensures that the function behaves correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
