Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(s)` checks whether the character 'z' appears in the substring of `s` that starts from the second character to the second last character.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Strings**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling empty strings, the current implementation already returns `False` when `s[1:-1]` is an empty string (which happens when `s` has fewer than 3 characters).
   - **Two Character Strings**: The function correctly handles the case where `s` is exactly two characters long by returning `False` because `s[1:-1]` results in an empty string.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description in all relevant scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
