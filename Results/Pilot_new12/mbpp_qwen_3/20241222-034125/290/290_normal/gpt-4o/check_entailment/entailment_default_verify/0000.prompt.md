You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' within the substring `s[1:-1]`. However, the problem description specifies that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word. The program does not exclude cases where 'z' is at the start or end of the word. For example, the string `'pzxzyabc.'` would return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It checks whether the character 'z' appears in the substring of `s` that starts from the second character to the second last character. If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers the following cases:
- If 'z' is present in the specified substring, the function returns `True`.
- If 'z' is not present in the specified substring, the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle empty strings (`""`). If `s` is an empty string, the function would raise an error because `s[1:-1]` would result in an empty string and checking for 'z' in an empty string would fail. To handle this case, the function should either return `False` or add a check at the beginning to handle empty strings appropriately.
- The function does not handle strings where `s` is exactly two characters long. In such cases, `s[1:-1]` would be an empty string, and the function would incorrectly return `False`. To handle this case, the function should check if `s` is exactly two characters long and return `False` in that scenario.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
