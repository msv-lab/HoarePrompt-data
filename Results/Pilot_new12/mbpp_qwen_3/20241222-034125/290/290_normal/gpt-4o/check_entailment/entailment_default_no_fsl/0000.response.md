Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle two specific edge cases:
1. Empty strings: If the input string `s` is an empty string, the function will attempt to access `s[1:-1]`, which results in an empty string and causes an `IndexError`. This case needs to be handled separately.
2. Strings of length 2: For strings of length 2, accessing `s[1:-1]` also results in an empty string, causing the function to incorrectly return `False`. The function should return `False` for these cases as well.

To fix these issues, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if len(s) <= 2:
        return False
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

This updated function correctly handles both edge cases and ensures that the function behaves as expected for every potential input case.
