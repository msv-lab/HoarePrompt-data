Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The function checks if the substring `s[1:-1]` (which excludes the first and last characters of the string) contains the letter 'z'.
2. If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`.
3. If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False`.

Let's validate this with the provided test cases:
- For the input `'pythonzabc.'`, the substring excluding the first and last characters is `'ythonza'`. Since 'z' is present, the function returns `True`, which matches the expected behavior.
- For the input `'zxyabc.'`, the substring excluding the first and last characters is `'xyabc'`. Since 'z' is not present, the function returns `False`, which matches the expected behavior.
- For the input `'  lang  .'`, the substring excluding the first and last characters is `' lang '` (assuming spaces are considered part of the string). Since 'z' is not present, the function returns `False`, which matches the expected behavior.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
