Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function should check if 'z' appears in the string except at the start and end of the word. The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation only checks if 'z' is in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means 'z' could still appear at the start or end of the word, leading to incorrect results.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns `True` if 'z' is found in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which does not guarantee that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word. For instance, in the string `'pzxyz'`, the current function would return `True` because 'z' is found in the substring `s[1:-1]`, even though 'z' is at the start and end of the word according to the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not fully meet the problem description.
