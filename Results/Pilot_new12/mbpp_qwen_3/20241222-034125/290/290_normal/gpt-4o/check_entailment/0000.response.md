Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' within the substring `s[1:-1]`. However, the problem description specifies that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word. The program does not exclude cases where 'z' is at the start or end of the word. For example, the string `'pzxzyabc.'` would return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
