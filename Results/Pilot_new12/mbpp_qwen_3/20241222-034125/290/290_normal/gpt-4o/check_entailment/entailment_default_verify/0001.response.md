Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not fully meet the problem description. The function `func_1` currently checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters. However, the problem description specifies that 'z' should not appear at the start and end of the word. The provided test cases and output hints do not cover the case where 'z' is part of a longer sequence but not at the start or end. For example, the string `'pzxyz'` should return `False` because 'z' appears in the middle (not at the start or end), but the current implementation would incorrectly return `True`.

To correctly implement the function, it should check if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]` and also ensure that 'z' is not the first or last character of the string. The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation is flawed in handling these specific cases. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
