Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program currently checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, but the problem description requires 'z' not to be at the start or end of the word. The program fails to exclude cases where 'z' is at the start or end of the word. For instance, the string `'pzxzyabc.'` would return `True`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function only checks for 'z' in the specified substring without considering its position relative to the start and end of the word. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
