Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `min()` function to find the smallest number in the list. The annotations confirm that the function takes a list as input and returns the minimum value from that list. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
