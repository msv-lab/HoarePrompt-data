Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a list of integers. It uses the built-in `min()` function to achieve this, which correctly identifies the smallest element in the list. The program includes assertions that test various scenarios, such as a list with multiple elements, a list with increasing values, and implicitly handles a non-empty list. Since the problem description only specifies that the function should find the smallest number in a list of integers and does not specify handling cases like an empty list or non-integer inputs (which are handled by the assumption of valid input), the program is correct.
