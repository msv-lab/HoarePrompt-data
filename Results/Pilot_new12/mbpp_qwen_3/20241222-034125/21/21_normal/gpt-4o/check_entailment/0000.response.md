Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the list. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases. The function handles lists with different lengths and values, including edge cases such as empty lists (which would raise a `ValueError` from `min()`, but such a case is not provided in the assertions). Given the provided test cases, the function works as expected for finding the smallest number in the list.
