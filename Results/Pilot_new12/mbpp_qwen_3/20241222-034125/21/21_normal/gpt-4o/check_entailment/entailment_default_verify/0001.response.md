Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program uses the `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list, which aligns with the problem description. The provided output hints confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and returns the minimum value, raising a `ValueError` for an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior. The assertions also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and no changes are needed.
