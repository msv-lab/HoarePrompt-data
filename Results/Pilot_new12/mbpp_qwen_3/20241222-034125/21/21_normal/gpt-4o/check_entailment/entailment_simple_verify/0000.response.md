Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The provided assertions test the function with different inputs, including lists of varying lengths and values, and the function passes all these tests. The annotations clarify that the input `lst` is a list of integers before the function call, which aligns with the problem description of finding the smallest number in a list. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
