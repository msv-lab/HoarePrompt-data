Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a list of integers. The implementation uses Python's built-in `min` function, which correctly returns the smallest element in the list. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected smallest values for different lists, confirming its correctness. Since the problem description only requires the function to work with valid inputs (lists of integers), and the program handles these inputs correctly, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
