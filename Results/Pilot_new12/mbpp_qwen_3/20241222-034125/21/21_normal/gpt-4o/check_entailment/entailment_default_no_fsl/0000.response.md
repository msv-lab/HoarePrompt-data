Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that correctly finds the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min` function. The function handles non-empty lists and returns the correct minimum value as shown in the assertions. It also raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. Since the code works for the given examples and there are no mentioned cases where it fails, the program is correct.
