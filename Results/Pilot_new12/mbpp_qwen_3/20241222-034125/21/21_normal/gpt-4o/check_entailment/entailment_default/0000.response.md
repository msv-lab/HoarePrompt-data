Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The function handles all the examples given and works for every potential case within the constraints provided. The function does not modify the original list and will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, which aligns with the typical behavior of the `min()` function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
