Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the list, which is the correct approach for solving the problem described. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected by returning the minimum value from the list and raising a `ValueError` if the list is empty. Given the assertions provided and the explanation in the original assessment, the function correctly implements the required functionality without any issues.
