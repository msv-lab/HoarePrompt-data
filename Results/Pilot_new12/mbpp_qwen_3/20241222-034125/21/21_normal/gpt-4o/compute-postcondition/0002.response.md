Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the minimum value from the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since there is no minimum value to return. The function does not modify the original list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `lst` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the list contains non-integer values. If the list contains elements that are not integers, the function will raise a `TypeError`. However, the annotation suggests that the function only deals with integer lists, so this can be considered part of the expected behavior without explicit handling mentioned in the code.
