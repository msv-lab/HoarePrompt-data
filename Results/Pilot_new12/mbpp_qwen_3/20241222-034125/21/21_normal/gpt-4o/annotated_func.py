#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the minimum value from the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since there is no minimum value to return. The function does not modify the original list.
