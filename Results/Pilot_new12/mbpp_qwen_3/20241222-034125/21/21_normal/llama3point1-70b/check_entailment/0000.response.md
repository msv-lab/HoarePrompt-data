Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses Python's built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This function will work for any non-empty list of numbers and handle all edge cases appropriately, such as lists containing negative numbers or zero. Since the function meets the requirement for finding the smallest number in a list for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
