Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a list of integers as input (`nums`) and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, and the given function correctly implements this functionality under the assumption of valid input, the program is correct.
