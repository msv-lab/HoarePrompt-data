Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. According to the problem description, the task is to write a function that finds the smallest number in a list. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning `None`, which aligns with the provided output hints. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle non-list inputs or other invalid cases, and we are assuming valid input as stated, the function is correct for the given requirements.
