Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(nums)` takes a list of integers `nums` and returns the smallest number using the built-in `min()` function. The `min()` function handles the case where `nums` is an empty list by raising a `ValueError`. Although the documentation and hints mention that the function will raise an error for an empty list, the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle this case, only that the function should find the smallest number in the list. Given the assumption that the input will be valid, the program is correct for all valid inputs.
