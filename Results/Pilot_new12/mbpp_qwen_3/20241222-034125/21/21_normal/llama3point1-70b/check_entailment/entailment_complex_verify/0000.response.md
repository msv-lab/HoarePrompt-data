Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct because it uses Python's built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. However, the annotated version provides additional context that the function does not explicitly handle the case where `nums` is an empty list. The `min()` function applied to an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, while the function works for non-empty lists of integers, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, which imply that the function should handle all possible inputs gracefully. Since the function raises an error for an empty list, it is not fully correct according to the problem description.
