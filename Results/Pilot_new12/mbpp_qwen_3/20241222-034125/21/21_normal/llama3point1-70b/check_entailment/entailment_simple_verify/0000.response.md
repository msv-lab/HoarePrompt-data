Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly uses Python's built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The annotation confirms that `nums` is a list of integers before the function call, and the function returns the minimum value from the list `nums`. Given that the input is assumed to be valid (a list of integers), the function meets the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
