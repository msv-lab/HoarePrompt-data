Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly uses Python's built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`, the original assessment does not fully capture the edge case handling mentioned in the output hints. Specifically, the function will raise a `ValueError` when applied to an empty list, as the `min()` function does not return a meaningful value for an empty list. While the output hints mention that the function returns `None` for an empty list, this is not actually the case; the function should either return `None` or raise an appropriate exception. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate, and the program should be considered incorrect based on the problem description and the provided information.
