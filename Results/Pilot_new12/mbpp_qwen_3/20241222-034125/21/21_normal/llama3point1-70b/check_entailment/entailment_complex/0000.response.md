Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function is designed to find and return the smallest number in a list of integers. The function uses the built-in `min()` function, which correctly identifies the smallest element in a non-empty list of numbers. 

While the annotation mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if `nums` is an empty list, the problem description does not explicitly require handling this edge case. Given the assumption that the input will be valid and the problem description focuses on finding the smallest number, the function correctly fulfills its intended purpose without needing to explicitly handle an empty list scenario. Thus, the function is correct according to the given problem description.
