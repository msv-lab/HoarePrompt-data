Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This function correctly implements the requirement for finding the smallest number in a list for all valid inputs, including edge cases such as an empty list (where `min` will raise a `ValueError`), a list with one element, or a list with multiple elements. Since the function behaves as expected for all these cases, the program is correct.
