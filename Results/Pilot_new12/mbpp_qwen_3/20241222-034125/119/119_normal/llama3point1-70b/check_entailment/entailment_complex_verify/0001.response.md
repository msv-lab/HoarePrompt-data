Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are numbers (integers or floats), and it swaps their values to return a tuple where the second number comes first followed by the first number. This perfectly aligns with the problem description which asks for a function that takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided code and its annotated version confirm that the function correctly implements this behavior for any valid inputs `a` and `b`. Therefore, the program is correct.
