Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are assumed to be numbers (integers or floats). The function returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number and then the first number. Therefore, the program is correct as it always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
