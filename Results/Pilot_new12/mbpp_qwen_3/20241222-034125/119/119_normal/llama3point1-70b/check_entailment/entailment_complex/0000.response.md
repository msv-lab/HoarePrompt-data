Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are numbers (integers or floats), and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior, stating that it swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in the order `(b, a)`. Since the function meets the exact requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
