Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. This exactly matches the problem description. For any inputs `a` and `b`, the function will return `(b, a)`, which is the correct output as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
