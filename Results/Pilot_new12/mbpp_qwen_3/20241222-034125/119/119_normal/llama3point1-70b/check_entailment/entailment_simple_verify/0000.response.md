Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the behavior of the function `func_1(a, b)`. It correctly shows that the function returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. This matches the problem description exactly, which asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Since the function behaves as expected for any pair of valid inputs (as per the given assumption), the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
