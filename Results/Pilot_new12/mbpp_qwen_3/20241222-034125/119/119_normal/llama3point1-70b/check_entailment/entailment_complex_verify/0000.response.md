Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number as the first element and the first number as the second element. This matches the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in reverse order, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no edge cases or functionalities missing as per the provided code, and the annotations support the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
