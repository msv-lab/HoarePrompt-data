Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them as a tuple, with the second number first and then the first number. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended for any valid inputs (integers or floats). Since the function handles all potential cases without any issues, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
