Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description by taking two numbers as input and returning a tuple where the second number comes before the first number. The output hints confirm this by stating that the function swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in reverse order, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints that would suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** stands valid.
