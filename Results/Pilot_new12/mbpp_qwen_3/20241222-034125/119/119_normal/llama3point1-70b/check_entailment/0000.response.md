Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. This matches the problem description exactly. Since the function behaves as expected for any pair of inputs, there are no cases found where the program does not work as described. Therefore, the function is correct.
