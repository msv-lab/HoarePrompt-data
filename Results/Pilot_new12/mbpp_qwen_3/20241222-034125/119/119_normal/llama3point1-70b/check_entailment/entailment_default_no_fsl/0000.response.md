Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which correctly swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in reverse order. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, assuming valid inputs. Since the code satisfies the requirements for all described cases, the correctness is True.
