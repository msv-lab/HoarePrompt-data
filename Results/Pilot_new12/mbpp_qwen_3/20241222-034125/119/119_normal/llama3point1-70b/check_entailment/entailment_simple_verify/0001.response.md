Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number, which perfectly aligns with the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `b` followed by `a`, further supporting the correctness of the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
