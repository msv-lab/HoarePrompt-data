Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. This perfectly matches the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function correctly swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in the reversed order. Since the function behaves as expected for any pair of valid numeric inputs, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
