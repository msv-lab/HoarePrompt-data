#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns a value of 'b' and a value of 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are numbers (integers or floats). It swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them. Specifically, it returns the value of `b` first and then the value of `a`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code; it accurately performs the intended action of swapping the values of `a` and `b` and returning them in reverse order.
