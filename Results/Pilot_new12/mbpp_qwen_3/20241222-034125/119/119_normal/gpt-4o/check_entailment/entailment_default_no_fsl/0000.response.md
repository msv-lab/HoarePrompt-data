Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple where `b` is the first element and `a` is the second element. This matches the problem description perfectly. The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Since the code and the problem description align, and the provided examples work correctly, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
