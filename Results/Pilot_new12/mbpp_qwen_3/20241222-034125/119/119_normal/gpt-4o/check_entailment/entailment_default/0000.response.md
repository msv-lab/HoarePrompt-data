Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

The function correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers. Since the problem description specifies that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, and the provided code satisfies this requirement for the given test cases, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified based on the problem description and the provided examples.
