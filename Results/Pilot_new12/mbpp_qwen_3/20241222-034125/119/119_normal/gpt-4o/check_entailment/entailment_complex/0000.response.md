Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. The function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input and returns a tuple where the second number (`b`) is placed before the first number (`a`). The function body simply returns `b, a`, which matches the required output format. The assertions in the annotated program also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since the problem description and the function implementation align perfectly, the program is correct.
