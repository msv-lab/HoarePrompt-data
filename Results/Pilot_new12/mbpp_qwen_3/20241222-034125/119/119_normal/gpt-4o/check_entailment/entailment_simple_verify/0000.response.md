Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated version confirms that the function takes two variables `a` and `b`, and returns `b` and `a` in that order. The provided assertions cover multiple scenarios and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
