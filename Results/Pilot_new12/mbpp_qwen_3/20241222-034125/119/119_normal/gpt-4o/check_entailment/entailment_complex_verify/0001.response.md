Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are numbers (integers or floats), and returns a tuple where the second parameter `b` is placed before the first parameter `a`. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and all pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Since the annotated version supports the correctness of the function and there are no contradictions or missing edge cases highlighted, the original assessment remains accurate.
