Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotations support this behavior, stating that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are numbers (integers or floats), and returns the values of `b` followed by `a`. The provided assertions cover various test cases, confirming the function's correctness. Therefore, there is no evidence from the annotations or the original assessment to suggest that the program is incorrect.
