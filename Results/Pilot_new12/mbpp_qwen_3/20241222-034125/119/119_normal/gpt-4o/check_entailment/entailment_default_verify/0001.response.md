Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple in the required order. The assertions provided in the code cover various scenarios and all pass, indicating that the function works as intended. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two numeric parameters and returns a tuple with the second parameter followed by the first parameter. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
