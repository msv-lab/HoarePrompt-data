Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. The function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. This matches the requirement stated in the problem description, which asks for a function that "takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number." The function `func_1` consistently achieves this behavior across all provided test cases.
