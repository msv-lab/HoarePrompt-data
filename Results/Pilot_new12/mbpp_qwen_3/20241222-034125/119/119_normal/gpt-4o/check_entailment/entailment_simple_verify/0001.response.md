Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple in the required order. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, taking two numbers `a` and `b`, and returning a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and all pass, indicating that the function works correctly under the given conditions. There are no contradictions or issues highlighted by the annotations that would suggest the program is incorrect.
