The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple in the required order. The assertions given in the code cover different scenarios and all of them pass. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that the current implementation fails to handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
