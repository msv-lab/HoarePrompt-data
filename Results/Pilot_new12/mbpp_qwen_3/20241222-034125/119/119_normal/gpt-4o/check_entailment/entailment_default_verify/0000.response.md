Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, as described in the problem statement. The provided output hints confirm this behavior, and the assertions in the code verify the function's correctness for the given test cases. There are no indications of incorrect behavior or unaddressed edge cases based on the provided information. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
