The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are numbers, which can be either integers or floats. The function returns `b` and `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are numbers (integers or floats), and return `b` followed by `a`.
