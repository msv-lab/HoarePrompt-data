#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns `b` and `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are numbers (integers or floats). It returns the values of `b` followed by `a`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code correctly implements the described behavior. After the function concludes, the program returns the tuple `(b, a)` where `b` is the first element and `a` is the second element.
