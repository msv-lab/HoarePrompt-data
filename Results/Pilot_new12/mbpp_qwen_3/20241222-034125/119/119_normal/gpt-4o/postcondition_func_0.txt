The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are numbers (integers or floats). It returns the values of `b` followed by `a`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code correctly implements the described behavior. After the function concludes, the program returns the tuple `(b, a)` where `b` is the first element and `a` is the second element.
