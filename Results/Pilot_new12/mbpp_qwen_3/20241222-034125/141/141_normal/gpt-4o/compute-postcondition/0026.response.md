Postcondition: ***`frequency` contains at least one key-value pair, `count` is equal to the integer value of `next_digit` + 1. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change to `count` and `frequency` is implied as there is no action specified in the else part.***
