To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information:

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: A non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str`: The string representation of `n`.
   - `frequency`: A dictionary where the keys are the unique digits in `digit_str`, and the values are the counts of those digits in `digit_str`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the items in the `frequency` dictionary.
   - Each item in `frequency.items()` is a tuple `(digit, count)`, where `digit` is a key from the dictionary and `count` is its corresponding value.

4. **Initial States to Adjust:**
   - For the loop to execute, the `frequency` dictionary must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - Therefore, the `frequency` dictionary must not be empty.

5. **Additional Context:**
   - Since `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` must be a valid string representation of an integer.
   - However, the existence and content of `digit_str` are already implied by `n`, so we don't need to adjust anything related to `n` itself.
   - The initial state of `digit_str` as a string representation of `n` is implicitly correct as long as `n` is a valid non-negative integer.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the `frequency` dictionary contains at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair**
