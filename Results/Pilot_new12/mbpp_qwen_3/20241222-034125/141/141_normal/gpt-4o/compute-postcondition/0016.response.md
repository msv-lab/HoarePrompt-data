Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique digits in `digit_str` and the values are the counts of those digits in `digit_str`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each digit in `digit_str`.
- For each digit, if it already exists in the `frequency` dictionary, its count is incremented by 1.
- If the digit does not exist in the `frequency` dictionary, a new entry is added with the digit as the key and a count of 1.
- After the loop completes, the `frequency` dictionary will contain each unique digit from `digit_str` as a key and the count of each digit in `digit_str` as the corresponding value.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `digit_str` is an empty string), then `frequency` remains an empty dictionary.
