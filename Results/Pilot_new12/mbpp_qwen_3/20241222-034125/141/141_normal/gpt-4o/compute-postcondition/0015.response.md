Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is "234", `frequency` is a dictionary. If `digit` is in `frequency`, then `frequency['2']`, `frequency['3']`, and `frequency['4']` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `frequency['2']`, `frequency['3']`, and `frequency['4']` are each set to 1.***
