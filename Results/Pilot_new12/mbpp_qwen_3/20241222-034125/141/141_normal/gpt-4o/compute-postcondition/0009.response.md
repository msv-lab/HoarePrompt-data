The code `frequency[digit] += 1` increments the count of the `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary by 1. However, the variable `digit` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `frequency`. We know that `digit` must be a key in the dictionary `frequency` and its corresponding value will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1 for the key `digit` that exists in the dictionary.**
