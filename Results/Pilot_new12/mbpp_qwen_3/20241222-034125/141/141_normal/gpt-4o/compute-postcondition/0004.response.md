The code increments the count of the digit found in `digit_str` in the `frequency` dictionary. Since `digit_str` is a non-empty string, let's assume it contains at least one digit (as the problem doesn't specify a particular digit, we'll consider a generic digit `d`). Initially, the value of `frequency[d]` is an integer, say `k`. After running the code, `frequency[d]` will be `k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1.**
