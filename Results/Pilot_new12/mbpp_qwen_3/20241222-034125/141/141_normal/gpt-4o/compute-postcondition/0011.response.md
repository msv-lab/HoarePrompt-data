Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary. If `digit` exists in `frequency`, then the value of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1. If `digit` does not exist in `frequency`, then `frequency` will contain at least one key-value pair where the key is `digit` and the value is 1.**
