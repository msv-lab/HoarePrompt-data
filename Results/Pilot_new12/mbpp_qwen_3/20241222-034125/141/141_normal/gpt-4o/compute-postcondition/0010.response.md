The code snippet `frequency[digit] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. Since the value of `digit` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `digit` must be a key in the dictionary after this line of code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `digit` and the value is 1.**
