Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`.
   - `frequency` is an empty dictionary.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character (`digit`) in `digit_str`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must not be an empty string. If `digit_str` is empty, the loop body will not run for any iteration.

4. **Modifying the Initial States**:
   - Since `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` should be a non-empty string if `n` is not zero. If `n` is zero, `digit_str` will be "0".
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `digit_str` is not an empty string.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `n` remains as a non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str` must be a non-empty string (since it represents a non-negative integer).
   - `frequency` remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified by the loop.

So, the final state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is an empty dictionary {}**
