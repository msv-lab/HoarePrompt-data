The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. Since `digit` is not in the `frequency` dictionary initially, this assignment will create a new entry with `digit` as the key and `1` as the value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with one entry `{digit: 1}`, the digit is in the `frequency` dictionary**
