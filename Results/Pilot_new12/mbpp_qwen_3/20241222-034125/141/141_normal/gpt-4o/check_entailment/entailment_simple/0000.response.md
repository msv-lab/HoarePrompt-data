Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: The function `func_1` takes a single integer `n` as input. Since the problem description specifies that the input should be a non-negative integer, and the function assumes this without explicit validation, the function is valid according to the given constraints.

2. **String Conversion and Frequency Count**: 
   - The function converts the integer `n` to its string representation (`digit_str`) and initializes an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each digit.
   - It iterates over each digit in `digit_str` and updates the count in the `frequency` dictionary. This ensures that all digits in `n` are counted accurately.

3. **Validation of Digit Frequencies**:
   - After counting the frequencies, the function iterates through each key-value pair in the `frequency` dictionary.
   - For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit (`count`) is less than or equal to the numeric value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
   - If any digit’s count exceeds its numeric value, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If all digit counts satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions test various cases:
     - `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because all digit counts are valid (1 <= 1, 2 <= 2, 3 <= 3, 4 <= 4).
     - `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the count of '5' (which is 1) is greater than its value (5).
     - `func_1(321)` returns `True` because all digit counts are valid (3 <= 3, 2 <= 2, 1 <= 1).

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, thus meeting the requirements and being correct.
