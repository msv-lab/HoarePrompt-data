Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function `func_1` must take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function first converts the integer `n` to a string (`digit_str`) to facilitate digit extraction.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each digit.
   - A loop iterates over each digit in `digit_str`, updating the count in `frequency`.
   - After calculating the frequency of each digit, another loop checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. If any count violates this condition, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If all digit counts satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - **Single Digit**: For a single-digit number, the count is 1, which is always less than or equal to the digit itself.
   - **Zero**: Although zero is not a valid digit, the function handles this by checking individual digit counts rather than relying on the digit itself.
   - **Repeating Digits**: The function correctly checks the count of repeating digits against their values.

Since the program accurately performs the required checks and handles various edge cases without violating the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
