Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The program converts the integer to a string to iterate over each digit, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies if the frequency is less than or equal to the digit. Given the test cases:

- `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequencies `[1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1]` satisfy the condition.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the frequency of `5` is `2`, which is greater than `5`.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True` because the frequencies `[3:1, 2:1, 1:1]` satisfy the condition.

Since the program passes the given test cases and the logic appears to cover all possible scenarios, the program is correct.
