Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this by considering a few cases:

1. For `n = 1234`:
   - Digits: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Frequencies: {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
   - Each digit's frequency is indeed less than or equal to the digit itself.
   
2. For `n = 51241`:
   - Digits: 1, 1, 2, 4, 5
   - Frequencies: {1: 2, 2: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}
   - The frequency of digit '5' is 1, which is less than 5, but the frequency of digit '1' is 2, which is not less than 1. This case correctly returns `False`.

3. For `n = 321`:
   - Digits: 1, 2, 3
   - Frequencies: {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}
   - Each digit's frequency is indeed less than or equal to the digit itself.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios and confirm that the function works as expected. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function fails based on the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
