Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function handles various cases, including edge cases like when `n` is 0 or consists of a single digit repeated multiple times. The function returns `False` when the frequency of any digit exceeds its numeric value and `True` otherwise, aligning with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
