Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function handles various cases, including edge cases like when `n` is 0 or consists of a single digit repeated multiple times. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended based on the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
