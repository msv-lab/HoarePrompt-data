The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to extract its digits, and then checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the numeric value of that digit. If for any digit the count exceeds its numeric value, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which has no digits), and when `n` consists of a single digit repeated multiple times (e.g., 111). In such cases, the function still adheres to the rule that the count should not exceed the digit's value.
