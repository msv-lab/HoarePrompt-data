Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `str_n`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least one character left in `str_n` to iterate over.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must have at least one character, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `int(digit)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: `str_n` must have at least one character.
2. **Loop Iteration**: Each character in `str_n` is processed by the loop.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `str_n` still has at least one character left.
   - The count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `int(digit)`.

### What Happens in the Next Iteration:
- Since we are iterating over each character in `str_n`, after the previous iteration, one character from `str_n` has been processed.
- Therefore, `str_n` now has one less character than it did at the start of the previous iteration.
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` remains unchanged unless the character just removed was a digit.

### Updated States:
- `str_n` will have one less character than before, but it will still have at least one character (since we know it had at least one character before and one character was just processed).
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
- `str_n` must have at least one character left.
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` is still less than or equal to `int(digit)`.

### Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must have at least one character, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to int(digit)**

However, since `str_n` loses one character per iteration, the more precise state would be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must have at least one character left, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to int(digit)**
