According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `str_n`. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must contain at least one character. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`n` is a non-negative integer**: This means `n` can be 0 or any positive integer.
2. **`str_n` is the string representation of `n`**: The string `str_n` should be the string form of the integer `n`.

For the loop to execute, `str_n` must have at least one character. If `n` is 0, then `str_n` would be "0", which has one character. If `n` is any other non-negative integer, `str_n` will have more than one character.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `str_n` must have at least one character.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must have at least one character**
