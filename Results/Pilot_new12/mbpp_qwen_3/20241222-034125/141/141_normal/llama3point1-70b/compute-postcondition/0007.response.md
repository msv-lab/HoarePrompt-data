Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string with at least one character left, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `digit`. If the count of digit characters in `str_n` is greater than `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.***
