Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is an empty string, and the function returns True.**

### Explanation:
- The loop checks each digit in `str_n` and compares its count in the string with the integer value of the digit.
- If any digit's count in `str_n` is greater than the digit itself, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any digit where its count is greater than the digit itself, the function returns `True`.

Since the loop only executes if `str_n` is not empty, once `str_n` becomes empty (after all digits have been checked), the loop condition fails and the function returns `True`.

Thus, after the loop has finished executing all possible iterations, `str_n` will be an empty string, and the function will return `True`.
