Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `str_n` is a string with at least one character left.
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `digit`.
- If the count of digit characters in `str_n` is greater than `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over each character in `str_n`:
```python
for digit in str_n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Character Extraction**: The loop will extract one character from `str_n` at a time.
2. **Count of Digits**: We need to keep track of the count of digit characters in `str_n` as we iterate through it.
3. **Loop Continuation**: The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `str_n` and the count of digits does not exceed `digit`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`str_n`**: One character will be removed from `str_n` at the start of each new iteration.
- **Count of Digits**: The count of digit characters will be updated if the extracted character is a digit.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `str_n` will lose one character (the current character being processed).
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` might change depending on whether the removed character was a digit or not.

Since no specific changes are mentioned for the variables `n` and `digit`, they remain the same.

### Final State
- `n` remains the same.
- `str_n` loses one character.
- The count of digit characters in `str_n` is updated based on the removed character.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string with at least one character less, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `digit`.**

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string with at least one character less, and the count of digit characters in `str_n` is less than or equal to `digit`**.
