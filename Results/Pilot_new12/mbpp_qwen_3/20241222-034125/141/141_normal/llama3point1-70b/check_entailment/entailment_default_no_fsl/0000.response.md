Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each digit, and uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of that digit in the string representation of the integer. It then compares this count with the digit (converted back to an integer) and returns `False` if the count exceeds the digit. If no such digit is found during the iteration, it returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to handle all cases correctly. For any integer input, the function accurately checks the frequency of each digit and ensures it meets the specified condition. There are no hints provided in the output hints section suggesting any issues, and the logic seems sound across all possible valid inputs.
