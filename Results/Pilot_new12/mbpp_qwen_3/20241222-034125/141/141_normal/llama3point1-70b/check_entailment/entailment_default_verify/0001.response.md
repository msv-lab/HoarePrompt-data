Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The output hints, though not explicitly provided, do not contradict the correctness of the function. The examples given in the original assessment cover various scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
