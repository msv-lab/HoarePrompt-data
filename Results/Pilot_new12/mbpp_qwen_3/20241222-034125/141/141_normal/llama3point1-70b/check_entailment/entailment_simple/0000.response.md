Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks the frequency of each digit in the integer representation of `n` against the digit itself, but it does not ensure that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. Instead, it checks if the count of each digit is greater than the digit itself, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires.

To meet the problem description, the program should check if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in set(str_n):  # Only iterate over unique digits
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that for each digit in the integer `n`, the frequency of the digit is checked against the digit itself, and if any digit fails this condition, the function immediately returns `False`. If all digits pass the condition, the function returns `True`.
