Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with a few test cases:

1. For `n = 321`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 1 time (≤ 3)
   - '2' appears 1 time (≤ 2)
   - '1' appears 1 time (≤ 1)

2. For `n = 332`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 2 times (≤ 3)
   - '2' appears 1 time (≤ 2)

3. For `n = 9876543210`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '9' appears 1 time (≤ 9)
   - '8' appears 1 time (≤ 8)
   - '7' appears 1 time (≤ 7)
   - '6' appears 1 time (≤ 6)
   - '5' appears 1 time (≤ 5)
   - '4' appears 1 time (≤ 4)
   - '3' appears 1 time (≤ 3)
   - '2' appears 1 time (≤ 2)
   - '1' appears 1 time (≤ 1)
   - '0' appears 1 time (0 ≤ 0)

4. For `n = 10`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '1' appears 1 time (≤ 1)
   - '0' appears 1 time (0 ≤ 0)

In all these cases, the function returns the correct result. Since no counterexample has been found where the function fails to meet the requirement, the function is correct.
