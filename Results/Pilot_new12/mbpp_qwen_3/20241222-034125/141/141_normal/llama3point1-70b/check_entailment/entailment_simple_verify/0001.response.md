Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The annotations do not contradict this assessment. The state of the program right before the function call confirms that `n` is a non-negative integer, and the function processes each digit of `n` to ensure its frequency condition is met. After executing the for loop, the function returns `True` if all digits satisfy the condition, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
