Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The annotations do not contradict this assessment. Specifically:

- Before the function call, `n` is a non-negative integer.
- During the execution of the `for` loop, the function counts the occurrences of each digit in the string representation of `n` and compares this count to the digit itself.
- After the `for` loop, if none of the digits violate the condition (i.e., the count is not greater than the digit), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it would have returned `False` earlier in the loop.

The annotations indicate that after the loop, the function returns `True`, which aligns with the logic of the function. Since the provided examples and the logical flow of the code support the requirement specified in the problem description, the original assessment is correct.
