Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this by considering different cases:

1. **Single-digit numbers**: For a single-digit number, the frequency of the digit is 1, which is always less than or equal to the digit itself.
2. **Multi-digit numbers**: For multi-digit numbers, the program converts the integer to a string and iterates through each digit. It then counts the occurrences of each digit and compares it with the digit itself. If any digit has a higher frequency, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Let's consider a few examples:
- For `n = 123`, the frequencies are {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}, which are all less than or equal to their respective digits. Thus, the function returns `True`.
- For `n = 332`, the frequencies are {3: 2, 2: 1}. Here, the frequency of '3' is 2, which is not less than or equal to the digit 3. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

Since the program correctly handles both single-digit and multi-digit numbers without missing any edge cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
