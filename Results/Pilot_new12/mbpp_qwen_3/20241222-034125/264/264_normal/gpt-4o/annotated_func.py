#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns degrees multiplied by pi divided by 180, where degrees is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. The function converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying `degrees` by \(\pi\) divided by 180 and returns the resulting value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not perform any additional checks or actions beyond the conversion.
