Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the degree value by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which are accurate according to the mathematical conversion formula. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a single argument `degrees`, which can be an integer or a float, and returns the corresponding radian value. Since the function logic is sound and the test cases pass, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
