Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the degree value by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which are \(1.5707963267948966\), \(1.0471975511965976\), and \(2.0943951023931953\) respectively. These values are accurate according to the mathematical conversion formula. Since the function appears to handle the provided test cases correctly and the logic seems sound for converting degrees to radians, we can conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description.
