Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by \(\pi / 180\). The assertions given in the program verify that the function works correctly for the provided test cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees). Since the problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code satisfies this requirement for the given test cases without any edge cases needing special handling, the code appears to be correct for every potential case within the scope of the provided information.
