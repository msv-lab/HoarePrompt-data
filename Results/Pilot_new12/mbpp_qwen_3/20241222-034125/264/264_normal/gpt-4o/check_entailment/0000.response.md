Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function passes the provided test cases:
- `func_1(90)` returns \( 1.5707963267948966 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
- `func_1(60)` returns \( 1.0471975511965976 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- `func_1(120)` returns \( 2.0943951023931953 \), which is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\).

Given the provided examples and the general formula for converting degrees to radians, the function appears to be correct for the described task. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
