Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer, and returns the corresponding radian value. The examples given in the problem description match the expected behavior of the function, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
