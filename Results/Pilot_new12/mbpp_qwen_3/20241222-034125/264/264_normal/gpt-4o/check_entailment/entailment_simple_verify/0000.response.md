Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function passes the provided test cases, and the annotations support the correctness by confirming that the input is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees, and the function returns the angle converted to radians. Therefore, there is no evidence from the annotations or the original assessment that suggests the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
