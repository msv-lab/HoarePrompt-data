Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying the degree value by \(\pi\) divided by 180. The annotations and assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees). Since the problem description only requires the function to convert degrees to radians without any additional constraints or edge cases, and the provided implementation satisfies this requirement, the program is correct.
