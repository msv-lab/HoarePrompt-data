You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function passes the provided test cases:
- `func_1(90)` returns \( 1.5707963267948966 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
- `func_1(60)` returns \( 1.0471975511965976 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- `func_1(120)` returns \( 2.0943951023931953 \), which is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\).

Given the provided examples and the general formula for converting degrees to radians, the function appears to be correct for the described task. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns degrees multiplied by pi divided by 180, where degrees is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. The function converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying `degrees` by \(\pi\) divided by 180 and returns the resulting value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not perform any additional checks or actions beyond the conversion.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
