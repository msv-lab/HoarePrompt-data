Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function performs the intended conversion properly. Since the program meets the problem description and the test cases validate its correctness, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
