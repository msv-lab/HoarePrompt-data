Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this conversion using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function passes the provided test cases, which are valid conversions:
- `func_1(90)` returns \( 1.5707963267948966 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
- `func_1(60)` returns \( 1.0471975511965976 \), which is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- `func_1(120)` returns \( 2.0943951023931953 \), which is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\).

The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function, stating that it accepts a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees and returns the corresponding radian value. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the annotations or code that indicate any potential issues with the function's implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
