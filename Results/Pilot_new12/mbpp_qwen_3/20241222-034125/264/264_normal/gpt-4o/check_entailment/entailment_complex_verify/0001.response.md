Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input `degrees` by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). The annotated version supports this by indicating that the function takes a float or integer representing an angle in degrees and returns the corresponding value in radians. The provided test cases in the annotations confirm that the function returns the expected values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which are accurate conversions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
