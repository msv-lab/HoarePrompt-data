Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the degree value by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input types (float or integer) and performs the conversion accurately without any issues. The provided test cases validate the function against known correct values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
