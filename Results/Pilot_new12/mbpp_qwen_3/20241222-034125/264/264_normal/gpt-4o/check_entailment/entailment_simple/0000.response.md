Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to convert degrees to radians, which is achieved by multiplying the input `degrees` by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). The program includes assertions that test the function with different inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees), and the returned values match the expected radian conversions. Since the function correctly implements the conversion formula and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
