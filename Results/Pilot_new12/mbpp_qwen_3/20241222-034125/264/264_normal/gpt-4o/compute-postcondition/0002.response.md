Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. The function converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying `degrees` by \(\pi\) divided by 180 and returns the resulting value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not perform any additional checks or actions beyond the conversion.**

This summary focuses on the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code, ensuring that all aspects of the functionâ€™s operation are covered without including unnecessary details or assumptions.
