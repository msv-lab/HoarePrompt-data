Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. It converts this angle to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180` and returns the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function correctly performs the conversion from degrees to radians for any valid input, and the final state of the program after execution is that it returns the angle in radians.**
