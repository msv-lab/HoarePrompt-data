Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description exactly. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. It then converts this angle to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180` and returns the result. Since the problem description specifies that the task is to write a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided function does exactly that without any additional or missing steps, the program is correct.
