Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` imports the `math` module and uses `math.pi` for the value of Ï€, which ensures the conversion is done correctly. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees, and returns the angle in radians using the correct formula. Since the annotations align with the problem description and there are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the function to fail, the program is correct.
