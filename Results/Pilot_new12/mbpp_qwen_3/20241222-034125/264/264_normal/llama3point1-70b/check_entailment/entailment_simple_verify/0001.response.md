Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The state annotations indicate that the input `deg` is expected to be a float or an integer representing the angle in degrees, and the function correctly returns the radian equivalent. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is maintained.
