Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). This formula is mathematically sound and the implementation uses the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module to ensure accuracy. There are no edge cases or special conditions that this program would fail for, as it works for any real number input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for converting degrees to radians in all potential cases.
