You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a float or an integer representing the angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the value of 'deg' converted to radians using the formula deg * math.pi / 180
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. It converts this angle to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180` and returns the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function correctly performs the conversion from degrees to radians for any valid input, and the final state of the program after execution is that it returns the angle in radians.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
