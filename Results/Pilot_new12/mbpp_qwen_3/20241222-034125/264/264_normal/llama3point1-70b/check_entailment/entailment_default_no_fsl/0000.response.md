Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a single parameter `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees. The function then converts this angle to radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180` and returns the result. Given the problem description to write a function that converts degrees to radians, the provided code meets this requirement. The output hints also confirm that the function works correctly for any valid input, without mentioning any specific edge cases that need special handling. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
