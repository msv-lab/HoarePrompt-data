Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` implements this formula accurately by importing the `math` module and using `math.pi` for the value of Ï€. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
