Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly evaluates the program. The function `func_1` accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function handles valid inputs (floats or integers) and returns the corresponding radian value. Since there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned that the program fails to handle, and the program meets the problem description of converting degrees to radians, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
