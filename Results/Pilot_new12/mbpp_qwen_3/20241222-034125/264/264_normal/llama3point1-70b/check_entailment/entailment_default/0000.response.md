Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to convert degrees to radians. The formula `deg * math.pi / 180` accurately converts an angle from degrees to radians. There are no edge cases or special handling required, as the function works for any valid input (float or integer). The output hints confirm that the function returns the angle in radians for any valid degree input, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
