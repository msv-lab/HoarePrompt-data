Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the program is correct because the function `func_1` accurately implements the formula for converting degrees to radians using `deg * math.pi / 180`. The provided output hints confirm that the function correctly handles valid inputs (floats or integers) and returns the angle in radians. There are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail, and the problem description asks only for the conversion from degrees to radians, which the function accomplishes correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
