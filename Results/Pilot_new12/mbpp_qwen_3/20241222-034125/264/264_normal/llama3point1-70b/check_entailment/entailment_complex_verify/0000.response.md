Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the formula for converting degrees to radians using the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which can be a float or an integer, and converts it to radians. Since the annotations align with the problem description and the implementation, and there are no edge cases or special conditions mentioned that would cause the program to fail, the program meets the requirements for converting degrees to radians. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
