Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians. It takes an input `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. This exactly matches the problem description, which states to write a function to convert degrees to radians. Since the program consistently applies this formula without any additional conditions or logic, it adheres to the problem description in all cases.
