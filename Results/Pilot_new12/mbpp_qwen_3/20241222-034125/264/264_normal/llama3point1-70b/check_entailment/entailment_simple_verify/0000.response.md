Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent in radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). The annotated version clarifies that the input `deg` is expected to be a float or an integer, which further supports the correctness of the function. Since the annotations align with the problem description and the implementation is mathematically sound, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
