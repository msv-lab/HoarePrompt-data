Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). This logic perfectly matches the problem description of filtering odd numbers. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, returning a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
