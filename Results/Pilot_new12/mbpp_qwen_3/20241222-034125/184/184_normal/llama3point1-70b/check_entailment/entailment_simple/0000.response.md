Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This directly aligns with the problem description which states, "Write a function to filter odd numbers." 

The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` iterates over each number in `nums`, checks if the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), and includes it in the resulting list if the condition is true. Since the function correctly implements this logic and returns a list of only the odd numbers, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
