Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list `nums` and returns a list containing only the odd numbers. The list comprehension used in the function accurately checks for odd numbers using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. The function handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty by returning an empty list. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement and output hints, the program is correct.
