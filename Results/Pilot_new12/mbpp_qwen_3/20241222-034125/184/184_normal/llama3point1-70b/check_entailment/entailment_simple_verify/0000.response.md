Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The annotation states that the program returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`, which aligns with the problem description of filtering odd numbers. The original assessment is accurate as the function meets the requirement specified in the problem description, and there are no issues with the provided code or annotations that would suggest otherwise.
