Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). This logic matches the problem description of filtering odd numbers. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases (any list of integers), the program is correct.
