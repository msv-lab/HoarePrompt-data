Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). Since the problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, this implementation satisfies the requirement for any input list. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
