Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The logic used in the list comprehension (`if num % 2 != 0`) correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if they are not divisible by 2. The annotated version also notes that if the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected behavior for a filtering operation. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
