Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The provided code and the output hints confirm that the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The function handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty by returning an empty list. There are no indications from the output hints that suggest any missing functionalities or incorrect behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
