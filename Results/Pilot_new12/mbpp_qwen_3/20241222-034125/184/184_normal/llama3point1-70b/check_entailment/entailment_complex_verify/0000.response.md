Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums` using a list comprehension. The annotations confirm that the function returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list, and it handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list. There are no missing functionalities or issues noted based on the provided code and annotations, thus maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
