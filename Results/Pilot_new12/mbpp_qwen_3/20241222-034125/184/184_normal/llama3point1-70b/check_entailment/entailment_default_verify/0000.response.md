Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of filtering odd numbers from a list. The provided output hints confirm that the function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers, returning only the odd numbers from the input list. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the expected functionality. Since the program handles the input list as described and there are no edge cases or specific inputs mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
