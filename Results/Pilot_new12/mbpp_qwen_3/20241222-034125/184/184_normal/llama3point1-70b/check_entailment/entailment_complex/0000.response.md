Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in `nums` and includes it in the resulting list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This precisely matches the problem description which states that the function should filter odd numbers from the given list of integers. Additionally, the function handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty by returning an empty list, which also aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
