Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from `nums`. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers. The returned list includes all odd numbers from the original list, but no even numbers. If the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no missing functionalities noted based on the provided code and annotations.**
