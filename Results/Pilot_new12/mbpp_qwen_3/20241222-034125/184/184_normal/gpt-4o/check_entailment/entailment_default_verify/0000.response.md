Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from the given list using a list comprehension with the condition `num % 2 != 0`. The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a list containing only the odd numbers. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations that suggest any issues. The examples given in the problem description and the original assessment also support the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
