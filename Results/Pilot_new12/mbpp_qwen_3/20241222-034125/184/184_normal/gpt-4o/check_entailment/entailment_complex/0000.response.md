Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension that filters out even numbers by checking if `num % 2 != 0`.

The assertions provided in the comments demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including lists with both odd and even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers. The logic used in the function ensures that only odd numbers are included in the returned list, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to filter odd numbers.

Since the function meets the problem description for all potential valid inputs, the program is correct.
