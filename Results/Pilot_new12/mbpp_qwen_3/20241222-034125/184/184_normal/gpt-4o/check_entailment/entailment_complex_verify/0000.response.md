Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the given list. The annotations clearly state that the function takes a list of integers and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since there are no apparent issues or edge cases that the function does not handle, and the annotated version supports the correctness of the function, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
