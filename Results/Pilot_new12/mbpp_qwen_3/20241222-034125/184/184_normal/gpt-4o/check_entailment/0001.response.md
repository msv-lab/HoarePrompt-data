Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and includes it in the result if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The assertions provided in the test cases cover several scenarios:

1. A list containing both odd and even numbers.
2. A list with mostly even numbers but a few odd ones.
3. A list with mostly odd numbers but a few even ones.

In each case, the function correctly returns a list of only the odd numbers from the input. Since the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the function does not handle, we can conclude that the function is correct for the given requirements.
