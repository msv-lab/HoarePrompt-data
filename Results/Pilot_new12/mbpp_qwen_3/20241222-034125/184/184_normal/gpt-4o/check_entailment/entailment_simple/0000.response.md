Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` filters out even numbers from the input list and returns a list containing only the odd numbers. The three assertions provided in the annotated program verify this behavior:

1. The first assertion checks that the function correctly filters out even numbers from the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, returning `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. The second assertion checks that the function correctly filters out even numbers from the list `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, returning `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. The third assertion checks that the function correctly filters out even numbers from the list `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, returning `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the problem description aligns with the implementation, the program is correct.
