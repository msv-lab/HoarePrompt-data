Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from the given list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The examples provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given inputs. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that this function does not handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for filtering odd numbers in every tested case.
