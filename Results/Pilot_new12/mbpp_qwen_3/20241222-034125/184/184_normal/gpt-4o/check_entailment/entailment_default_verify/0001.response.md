Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers as described in the problem statement. The provided output hints confirm that the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and includes only the odd numbers in the result. The assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with a mix of odd and even numbers, lists with mostly even numbers, and lists with mostly odd numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in these test cases and there are no specific edge cases mentioned that the function does not handle, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
