Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes them successfully. The annotated version reinforces that the function iterates through the list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers, as intended by the problem description. Since there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the function does not handle, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
