Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The examples given in the problem description show that the function works as expected for different inputs, including lists with varying lengths and contents. Since the function logic and examples align with the problem description, the program is correct for every potential case.
