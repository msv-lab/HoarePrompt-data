Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from the given list as demonstrated by the test cases. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (`num % 2 != 0`). The examples provided show that the function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with both even and odd numbers, and lists with all odd numbers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of filtering odd numbers based on the problem description.
