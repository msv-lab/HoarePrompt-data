Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension. The function iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the result if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The annotations in the annotated version confirm that the function returns a list of odd numbers from the original list `nums`.

The assertions provided in the test cases cover various scenarios:

1. A list containing both odd and even numbers.
2. A list with mostly even numbers but a few odd ones.
3. A list with mostly odd numbers but a few even ones.

In each case, the function correctly returns a list of only the odd numbers from the input. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the function does not handle. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
