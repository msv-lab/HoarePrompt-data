Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing only the odd numbers from the original list `nums`. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers, ensuring that the returned list consists solely of odd integers. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, and the provided logic correctly filters the list as intended.**
