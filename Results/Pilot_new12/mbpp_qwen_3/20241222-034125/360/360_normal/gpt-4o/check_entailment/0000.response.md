Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list within the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. Given the assertions provided:

1. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` returns `[10, 11, 12]`, which is correct as the sum of `[10, 11, 12]` is 33, the highest among the given sublists.
2. `func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]])` returns `[12, 11, 10]`, which is correct as the sum of `[12, 11, 10]` is 33, the highest among the given sublists.
3. `func_1([[2, 3, 1]])` returns `[2, 3, 1]`, which is correct as there is only one sublist, and its sum is the highest by default.

Since the function handles all the provided test cases correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the sublist with the highest sum, the function is correct. There doesn't appear to be any edge case that would make the function fail based on the given problem description and examples.
