Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements in each sublist. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the variables `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly. The assertions provided in the test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with different lengths and values, and the function passes these tests. There are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that the function does not handle, as indicated by the provided output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
