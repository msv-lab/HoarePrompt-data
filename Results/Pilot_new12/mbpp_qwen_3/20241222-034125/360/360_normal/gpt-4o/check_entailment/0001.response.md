Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements in each sublist. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and iterates through each sublist, calculating its sum. If the current sublist's sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. The assertions provided in the test cases cover various scenarios including lists with different lengths and values, and the function passes these tests. Since the function works as expected for the given test cases and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that the function does not handle, the program is correct.
