Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find and return the sublist within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `max_sum` is initialized to `float('-inf')` (negative infinity), ensuring that any sum encountered in the sublists will be larger initially.
   - `max_list` is initialized as an empty list, which is appropriate since there is no sublist to start with until one is found that meets the criteria.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements using `sum(sublist)`.
   - It then compares this sum with `max_sum`. If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - After iterating through all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which holds the sublist with the highest sum.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
     - A list with multiple sublists of varying sums.
     - A list with a single sublist.
     - Ensuring that the function handles cases where the maximum sum might be the initial value of `-inf` if no sublists are larger.

Since the function `func_1` follows the logic described in the problem statement and correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements, the program is correct.
