Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should return the list from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers.
   - It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` as an empty list.
   - It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in the sublist using `sum(sublist)`, and compares it with `max_sum`.
   - If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
   - After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`.

The program correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum and returns it. The initial values of `max_sum` and `max_list` ensure that if no sublists have a positive sum, `max_list` remains an empty list. This matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required to find and return the sublist with the highest sum, and handles cases where no such sublist exists (returning an empty list), it satisfies the problem description.
