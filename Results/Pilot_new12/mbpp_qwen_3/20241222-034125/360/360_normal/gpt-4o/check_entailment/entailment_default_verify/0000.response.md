Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of its elements. The original assessment is accurate because the function iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The output hints also support this, indicating that the function handles the case where all sublists have a sum less than or equal to zero by returning an empty list. Since the function passes all the provided assertions and the logic is sound, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
