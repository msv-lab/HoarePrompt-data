Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The annotations provided clarify the state of the program at different stages and align with the logic of the function. Specifically:

- The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` if the current sublist's sum is greater than `max_sum`.
- After the loop, the function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum.

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected across different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
