You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list within the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. Given the assertions provided:

1. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` returns `[10, 11, 12]`, which is correct as the sum of `[10, 11, 12]` is 33, the highest among the given sublists.
2. `func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]])` returns `[12, 11, 10]`, which is correct as the sum of `[12, 11, 10]` is 33, the highest among the given sublists.
3. `func_1([[2, 3, 1]])` returns `[2, 3, 1]`, which is correct as there is only one sublist, and its sum is the highest by default.

Since the function handles all the provided test cases correctly and the logic seems sound for finding the sublist with the highest sum, the function is correct. There doesn't appear to be any edge case that would make the function fail based on the given problem description and examples.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist to calculate the sum of its elements. It then updates two variables, `max_sum` and `max_list`, to store the maximum sum found and the corresponding sublist. If no sublists have a positive sum, `max_sum` remains `-inf` and `max_list` remains an empty list. The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. This means that if all sublists have a sum less than or equal to zero, the function will return an empty list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
