Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. If multiple sublists have the same highest sum, it will return any one of them, which is acceptable since the problem description does not specify that the returned sublist must be unique. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, and the provided test cases demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, including edge cases like single-element sublists and sublists with non-positive sums.
