Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the list within the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The annotations support this by clearly explaining the state of the program at various points and confirming that the function logic is sound. The provided assertions also validate the function against different scenarios, including edge cases like a single-element list. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
