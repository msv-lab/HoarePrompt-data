Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists. The code initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. It then iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly. The function returns the sublist with the highest sum. Given the problem description and the assertions, the code handles various cases correctly, including when all sublists have non-positive sums (as indicated by the assertion with an empty list `[2, 3, 1]`). Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
