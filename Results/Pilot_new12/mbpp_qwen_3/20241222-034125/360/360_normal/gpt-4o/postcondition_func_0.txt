The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist to calculate the sum of its elements. It then updates two variables, `max_sum` and `max_list`, to store the maximum sum found and the corresponding sublist. If no sublists have a positive sum, `max_sum` remains `-inf` and `max_list` remains an empty list. The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. This means that if all sublists have a sum less than or equal to zero, the function will return an empty list.
