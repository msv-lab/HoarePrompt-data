`max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` will become the new value of `max_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
