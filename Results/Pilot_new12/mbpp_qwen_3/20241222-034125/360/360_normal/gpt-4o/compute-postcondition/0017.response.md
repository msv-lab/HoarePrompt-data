Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `current_sum`; `max_list` is the current sublist if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise it remains the same as the previous `max_list`; `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.***
