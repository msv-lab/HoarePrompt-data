The code initializes `current_sum` to the sum of the `sublist`. Since `sublist` is part of `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` will be the sum of the current sublist being processed.

The initial state is:
- `list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers.
- `max_sum` is the maximum sum encountered so far or updated to the sum of the current sublist.
- `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or updated to the current sublist if its sum was greater.

After executing the line `current_sum = sum(sublist)`, the variable `current_sum` is set to the sum of the current sublist, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is the maximum sum encountered so far or updated to the sum of the current sublist; `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or updated to the current sublist if its sum was greater; `current_sum` is the sum of the current sublist.**
