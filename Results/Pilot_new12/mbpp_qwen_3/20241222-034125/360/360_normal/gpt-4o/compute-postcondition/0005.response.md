The code `max_sum = current_sum` assigns the current value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` now holds the same value as `current_sum`, which was previously greater than the previous `max_sum`.

The states of the other variables (`list_of_lists`, `max_list`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the same value as `current_sum`, which is greater than the previous `max_sum`, `max_list` is the first sublist of `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist of `list_of_lists`**
