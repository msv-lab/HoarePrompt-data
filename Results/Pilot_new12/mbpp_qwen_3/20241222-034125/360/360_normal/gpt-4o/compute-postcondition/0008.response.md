To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Given Information:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers.
- `max_sum` is the maximum sum encountered so far among the sublists of `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum.
- Initially, `max_sum` is `-inf` (negative infinity), and `max_list` is an empty list.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`). If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and `max_list` to the current sublist. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- We need to know the state at the end of the previous iteration to determine what happens in the next iteration.

Let's assume we don't know the exact values but can derive the necessary conditions:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Sublist Being Processed**: The current sublist being processed is the one right before the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Sum of Current Sublist (`current_sum`)**: This is the sum of the elements in the current sublist being processed.
3. **Decision for Updating `max_sum` and `max_list`**:
   - If `current_sum > max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the current sublist.
   - If `current_sum <= max_sum`, then `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another sublist in `list_of_lists` to process.

### States to Adjust:
- `list_of_lists`: Since there must be at least one more sublist for the loop to continue, `list_of_lists` must still contain sublists.
- `max_sum`: If the current sublistâ€™s sum (`current_sum`) was greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` would have been updated to this new value. If not, `max_sum` remains unchanged.
- `max_list`: If the current sublistâ€™s sum was greater than `max_sum`, `max_list` would have been updated to this new sublist. If not, `max_list` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers with at least one more sublist, `max_sum` is either the maximum sum encountered so far or updated to the sum of the current sublist if it was greater, and `max_list` is either the sublist with the maximum sum or updated to the current sublist if its sum was greater**.

To express it concisely:
State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum encountered so far or updated to the sum of the current sublist, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or updated to the current sublist if its sum was greater**.
