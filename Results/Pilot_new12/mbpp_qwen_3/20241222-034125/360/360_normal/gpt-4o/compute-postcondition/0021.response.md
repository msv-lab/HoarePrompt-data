Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist to calculate the sum of its elements. It then updates two variables, `max_sum` and `max_list`, to store the maximum sum found and the corresponding sublist. If no sublists have a positive sum, `max_sum` remains `-inf` and `max_list` remains an empty list. The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. This means that if all sublists have a sum less than or equal to zero, the function will return an empty list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If all sublists in `list_of_lists` have a sum less than or equal to zero, `max_sum` remains `-inf` and `max_list` remains an empty list.
- If `list_of_lists` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list since no sublists are present to compare.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations mention that `max_sum` and `max_list` are initially set to `-inf` and an empty list, respectively. However, the code does not explicitly initialize these variables before the loop. While this does not affect the outcome, it is worth noting for completeness.
