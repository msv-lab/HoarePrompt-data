The code initializes an empty list named `max_list`. The variable `max_sum` remains unchanged, and the state of `list_of_lists` also remains unchanged since no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is -inf; `max_list` is an empty list**
