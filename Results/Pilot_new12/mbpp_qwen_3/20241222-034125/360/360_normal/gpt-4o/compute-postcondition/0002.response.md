According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, and `max_sum` is set to `-inf`, and `max_list` is an empty list.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist.

Therefore, the state should be modified to reflect this requirement.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers that must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list**
