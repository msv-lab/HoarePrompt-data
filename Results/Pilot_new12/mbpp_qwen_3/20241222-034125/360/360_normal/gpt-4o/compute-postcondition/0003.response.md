The code initializes `current_sum` to the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `current_sum` is not known, but it is now the sum of the first sublist. The values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist of `list_of_lists`**
