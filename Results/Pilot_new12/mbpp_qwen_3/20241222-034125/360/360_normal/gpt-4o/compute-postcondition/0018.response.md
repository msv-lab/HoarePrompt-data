Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is the maximum sum of any sublist in `list_of_lists`; `max_list` is the sublist in `list_of_lists` that has the maximum sum. Initially, `max_sum` is -inf, and `max_list` is an empty list. After the loop finishes executing, `max_sum` and `max_list` are updated to reflect the maximum sum and corresponding sublist encountered during the iteration of `list_of_lists`. If no sublists are present in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` remains -inf and `max_list` remains an empty list.**
