The code initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This does not affect any existing values in `list_of_lists`, so the list of lists remains unchanged. The only new variable `max_sum` is initialized to `-inf`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is `-inf`.**
