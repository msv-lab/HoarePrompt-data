Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum encountered so far among the sublists of `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum. Initially, `max_sum` is -inf, and `max_list` is an empty list. If the sum of the first sublist (`current_sum`) is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the first sublist. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
