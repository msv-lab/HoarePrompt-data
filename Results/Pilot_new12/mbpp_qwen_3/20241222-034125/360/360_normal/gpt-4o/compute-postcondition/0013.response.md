Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers.
   - `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
   - `max_list` is updated to the current sublist if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
   - `current_sum` remains the sum of the current sublist.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

3. **What Changes During Each Iteration**:
   - `sublist` is the current sublist being processed.
   - `current_sum` is updated to the sum of the elements in the current sublist.
   - `max_sum` and `max_list` are potentially updated based on the value of `current_sum`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop processes each sublist sequentially, at the start of the next iteration, `sublist` will be the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - `current_sum` will be reset to the sum of the new sublist.
   - `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged from the previous iteration unless the new `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

Given this analysis, at the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect the new sublist being processed and the reset of `current_sum` to the sum of that new sublist. The values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain as they were from the previous iteration unless the new `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `list_of_lists` is still a non-empty list of lists of integers.
- `max_sum` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `max_list` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `max_list` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
