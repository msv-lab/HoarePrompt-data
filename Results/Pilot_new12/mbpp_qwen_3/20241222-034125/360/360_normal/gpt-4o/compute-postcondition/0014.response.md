The code `current_sum = sum(sublist)` updates the value of `current_sum` to be the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since the exact sublist is not specified, we denote it as `sublist`. The other variables (`list_of_lists`, `max_sum`, and `max_list`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `max_list` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
