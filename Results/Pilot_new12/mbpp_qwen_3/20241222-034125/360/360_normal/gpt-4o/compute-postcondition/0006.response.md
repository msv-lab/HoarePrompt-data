The code assigns the current value of `sublist` to `max_list`. The previous value of `max_list` was the first sublist of `list_of_lists`. Since no new value for `sublist` is given, it retains its previous value. The other variables (`max_sum`, `current_sum`, and `list_of_lists`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the same value as `current_sum`, which is greater than the previous `max_sum`, `max_list` is now the value of `sublist`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first sublist of `list_of_lists`**
