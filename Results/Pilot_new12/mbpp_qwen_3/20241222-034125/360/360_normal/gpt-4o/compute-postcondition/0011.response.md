The code `max_list = sublist` updates the value of `max_list` to the current value of `sublist`. The other variables (`list_of_lists`, `max_sum`, `current_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is the value of `current_sum`; `max_list` is the current value of `sublist`; `current_sum` is the sum of the current sublist.**
