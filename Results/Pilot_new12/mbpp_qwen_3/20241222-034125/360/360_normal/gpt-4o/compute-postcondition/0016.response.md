The code assigns the current sublist (`sublist`) to `max_list`. This means that `max_list` will now hold the values of the current sublist, and the values of `max_sum`, `current_sum`, and `list_of_lists` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists of integers; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is the same as the current sublist; `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
