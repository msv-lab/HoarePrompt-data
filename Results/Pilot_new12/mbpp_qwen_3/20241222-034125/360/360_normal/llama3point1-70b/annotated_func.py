#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the list from the `lists` that has the maximum sum of its integer elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers, and returns the list with the maximum sum of its integer elements. If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since no list can be compared for the maximum sum. If multiple lists have the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them arbitrarily.
