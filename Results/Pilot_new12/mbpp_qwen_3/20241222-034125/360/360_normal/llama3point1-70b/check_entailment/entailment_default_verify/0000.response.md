Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the function `func_1`. The function indeed returns the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling the case where the input is an empty list by raising a `ValueError`, and returning one of the lists with the maximum sum in case of ties. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns the list with the highest sum of elements, and the provided function meets this requirement, the original assessment is accurate.
