Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument to find the list within the input list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. This approach works for all potential cases:

1. It handles non-empty lists of lists correctly by finding the list with the maximum sum.
2. It returns one of the lists with the maximum sum in case of ties, which aligns with the problem description stating that it returns "one of them arbitrarily."
3. Although the problem description mentions that raising a `ValueError` for an empty list would be acceptable, the code does not explicitly include this error handling. However, since the instruction states that we assume valid input, this omission is not a concern in this context.

Therefore, the code satisfies the requirements for every potential case as per the given assumptions.
