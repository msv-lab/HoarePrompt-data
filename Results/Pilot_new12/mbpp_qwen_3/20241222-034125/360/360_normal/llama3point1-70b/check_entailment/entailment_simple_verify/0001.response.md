Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum from a list of lists, as described in the problem statement. The annotation clarifies that `lists` is a list of lists of integers, ensuring that the `sum` function can be applied to each list without error. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument correctly finds the list whose elements' sum is the maximum. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a list of lists containing integers), the function will always produce the expected result. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
