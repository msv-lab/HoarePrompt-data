Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument finds the list with the maximum sum. This solution works for all potential cases as long as the input is a list of lists containing numerical values. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
