Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and returns the list with the highest sum of its elements. This is achieved using the `max` function with `key=sum`, which finds the element in the list that has the maximum value according to the `sum` function. Since the problem description requires returning the list with the highest sum of elements, and the provided program does exactly that, the program is correct.
