Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of integers (`lists`) as input. It uses the `max` function with `key=sum` to find and return the list with the highest sum of its integer elements. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The function handles the case where `lists` might be empty by raising a `ValueError`, which is a reasonable response given the problem constraints. Since the function behaves as specified for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
