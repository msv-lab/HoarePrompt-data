Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotation "lists is a list of lists of integers" ensures that the input adheres to the expected format. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument is appropriately used to find the list with the maximum sum. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns the list with the highest sum of elements, and the provided code meets this requirement under the given assumptions, the original assessment remains correct.
