Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The function uses the `max` function with `key=sum` to identify the list with the maximum sum. The code handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an arbitrary list (or raising a `ValueError`, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the code itself).

The output hints confirm that the function returns the list with the maximum sum of its integer elements, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or examples provided that would indicate the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case under the given assumptions. Therefore, the code is correct.
