Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum from a list of lists. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument finds the list whose elements' sum is the maximum. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `lists` is empty by raising a `ValueError`, which is appropriate given the problem description. Additionally, the function returns one of the lists with the maximum sum arbitrarily when there are ties, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
