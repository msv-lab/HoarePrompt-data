Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to find and return the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotated version further clarifies that the function raises a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, which aligns with the problem description and ensures that the function behaves as expected under valid input conditions. The annotated version also mentions that if multiple lists have the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them arbitrarily, which is consistent with the problem description and the use of the `max` function without specifying a custom tie-breaking mechanism. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
