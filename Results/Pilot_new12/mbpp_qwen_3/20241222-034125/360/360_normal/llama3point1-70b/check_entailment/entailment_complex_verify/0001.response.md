Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the program. The function `func_1` is designed to find the list with the highest sum from a list of lists. The annotation confirms that the function operates correctly under the assumption that the input is a list of lists containing integers. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument effectively finds the list with the maximum sum. The annotation also correctly notes that the function will raise a `ValueError` if `lists` is an empty list, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
