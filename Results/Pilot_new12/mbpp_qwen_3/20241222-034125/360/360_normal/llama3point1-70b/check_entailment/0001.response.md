Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum from a list of lists. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument finds the list whose elements' sum is the maximum. This solution works for all potential cases as long as the input is a list of lists where each inner list contains numeric values. There is no scenario where this function would fail based on the given problem description.
