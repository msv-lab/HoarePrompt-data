Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers, and returns the list with the maximum sum of its integer elements. If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since no list can be compared for the maximum sum. If multiple lists have the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them arbitrarily.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `lists` is an empty list, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no lists to compare.
- If multiple lists in `lists` have the same maximum sum, the function will return one of those lists, but it is not specified which one.**

**Summary of Final State:**
After the function concludes, the program will have returned one of the lists from the input `lists` that has the highest sum of its integer elements. If the input list `lists` is empty, the function will raise an error.
