The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers, and returns the list with the maximum sum of its integer elements. If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` since no list can be compared for the maximum sum. If multiple lists have the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them arbitrarily.
