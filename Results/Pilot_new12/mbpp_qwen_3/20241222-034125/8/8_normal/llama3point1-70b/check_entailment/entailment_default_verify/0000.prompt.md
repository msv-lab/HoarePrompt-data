You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string. Here's why:

1. **First Occurrence Removal**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character. If found, it gets stored in `first_occurrence`.
2. **Last Occurrence Removal**: Similarly, `s.rfind(char)` is used to find the index of the last occurrence of the character. This is stored in `last_occurrence`.
3. **Handling Cases**: 
   - If both occurrences are the same (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the function replaces only the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If they are different, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string, removing the specified character from both the start and end.

This approach ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are removed correctly, covering all potential cases. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It determines the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first occurrence of `char` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged. The function handles the following cases:
1. Returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
2. Returns a substring of `s` that excludes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
3. Returns the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s` or appears only once.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears multiple times in `s` and removes only the first occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears exactly once in `s` and removes that occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` does not appear in `s` and returns the original string.
- The function correctly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string (though these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the annotations).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
