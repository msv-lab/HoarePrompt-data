Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string. Here's why:

1. **First Occurrence Removal**: The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character. If found, it gets stored in `first_occurrence`.
2. **Last Occurrence Removal**: Similarly, `s.rfind(char)` is used to find the index of the last occurrence of the character. This is stored in `last_occurrence`.
3. **Handling Cases**: 
   - If both occurrences are the same (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the function replaces only the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If they are different, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string, removing the specified character from both the start and end.

This approach ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are removed correctly, covering all potential cases. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
