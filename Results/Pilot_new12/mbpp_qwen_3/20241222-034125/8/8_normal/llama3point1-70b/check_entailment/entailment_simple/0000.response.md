Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: 
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the index of the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Checking for Valid Occurrences**:
   - If both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are valid indices (i.e., neither is `-1`), the function proceeds to remove these occurrences.
   
3. **Case Where First and Last Occurrences Are at the Same Index**:
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, the function uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove only the first occurrence of `char`. This ensures that only the first instance of the character is removed, as required.

4. **Case Where First and Last Occurrences Are Different Indices**:
   - If `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are different, the function constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) the first occurrence of `char`.
     - The substring from the position after the first occurrence of `char` up to (but not including) the last occurrence of `char`.
     - The substring from the position after the last occurrence of `char` to the end of the string.
   - This ensures that both the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed.

5. **Case Where `char` Does Not Appear in the String**:
   - If `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`, indicating that `char` does not appear in the string, the function simply returns the original string `s`.

In summary, the program correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement and meets the requirements exactly. Therefore, the program is correct.
