Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. The annotated version supports the following:

1. **String containing the character multiple times**: The function correctly identifies and removes the first and last occurrences of the character.
2. **String containing only one occurrence of the character**: The function correctly removes that single occurrence.
3. **String without the character**: The function returns the original string.
4. **Empty string**: The function returns the empty string as expected.
5. **String with multiple instances of the same character**: The function correctly removes the first and last occurrence.

The annotated version clearly shows that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios described in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
