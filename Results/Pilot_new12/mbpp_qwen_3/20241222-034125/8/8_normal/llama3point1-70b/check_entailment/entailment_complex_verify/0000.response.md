Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code aligns perfectly with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, as described. 

1. The function finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character.
2. If the character appears multiple times, it removes the first occurrence.
3. If the character appears exactly once, it removes that single occurrence.
4. If the character does not appear at all, it returns the original string.

The annotated version clearly shows how the function behaves in different scenarios, including handling cases where the character appears multiple times, exactly once, or not at all. The original assessment correctly concluded that the function meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is accurate.
