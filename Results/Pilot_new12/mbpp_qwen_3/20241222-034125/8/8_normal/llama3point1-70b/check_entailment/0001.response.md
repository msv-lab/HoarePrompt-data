Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Let's analyze the different cases:

1. **String contains the character:**
   - If the character appears multiple times in the string, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.
   - Example: `s = "hello world", char = "o"` -> Returns `"hell wrld"`

2. **String contains only one occurrence of the character:**
   - If the character appears only once in the string, the function correctly removes that single occurrence.
   - Example: `s = "hello", char = "l"` -> Returns `"heo"`

3. **String does not contain the character:**
   - If the character does not appear in the string, the function returns the original string.
   - Example: `s = "hello", char = "x"` -> Returns `"hello"`

4. **Empty string:**
   - If the string is empty, the function returns the empty string as expected.
   - Example: `s = "", char = "x"` -> Returns `""`

5. **String with multiple characters to remove:**
   - If the string contains multiple instances of the same character, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrence.
   - Example: `s = "aabbcc", char = "b"` -> Returns `"aaccc"`

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and there are no potential cases identified where the function does not work as expected, the program is correct.
