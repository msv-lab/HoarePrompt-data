Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function handles all the potential cases as described in the output hints:
1. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first occurrence.
2. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it removes that occurrence.
3. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns the original string.

The function uses `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)` to identify the first and last occurrences, respectively, and constructs a new string by excluding these characters. The logic is sound and covers all necessary scenarios, including edge cases like an empty string or a character that does not exist in the string. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints confirm its correctness.
