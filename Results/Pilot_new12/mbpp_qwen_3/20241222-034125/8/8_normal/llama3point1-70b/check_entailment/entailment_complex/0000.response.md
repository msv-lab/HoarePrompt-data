Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **First and Last Occurrence Handling**: 
   - The program correctly finds the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)` and the last occurrence using `s.rfind(char)`.
   - If `char` is found in `s`, the program proceeds to remove the first and last occurrences of `char`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Occurrence**: When `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the program removes the single occurrence as required.
     ```python
     if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence):
         return s.replace(char, '', 1)
     ```
   - **Multiple Occurrences**: When `char` appears more than once in `s`, the program removes the first occurrence and keeps the rest of the string intact.
     ```python
     return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
     ```
   - **No Occurrence**: When `char` does not appear in `s`, the program returns the original string `s` without any modifications.
     ```python
     return s
     ```

3. **General Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` might be `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.
   - The function also implicitly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string, which are not explicitly mentioned but are valid assumptions under the given constraints.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
