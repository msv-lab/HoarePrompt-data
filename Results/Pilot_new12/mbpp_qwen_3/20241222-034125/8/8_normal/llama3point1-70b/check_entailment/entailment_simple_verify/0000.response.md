Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly handles the removal of the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string. The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code support this:

1. **First Occurrence Removal**: When `first_occurrence` is not `-1`, the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of the character.
2. **Last Occurrence Removal**: When `last_occurrence` is not `-1`, the function correctly identifies the last occurrence of the character.
3. **Handling Cases**: 
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, the function removes only the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If `first_occurrence` does not equal `last_occurrence`, the function constructs a new string by excluding both the first and last occurrences.

The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, including handling cases where the first and last occurrences are the same and cases where they are different. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
