You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a substring of `s` that excludes the first and last occurrences of `char`
    else :
        return s
        #`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, `last_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. Either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1. The program returns `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It determines the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first occurrence of `char` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged. The function handles the following cases:
1. Returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
2. Returns a substring of `s` that excludes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
3. Returns the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s` or appears only once.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears multiple times in `s` and removes only the first occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears exactly once in `s` and removes that occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` does not appear in `s` and returns the original string.
- The function correctly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string (though these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the annotations).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
