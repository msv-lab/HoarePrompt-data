Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string, handling various cases such as when the character appears multiple times, exactly once, or not at all. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in all mentioned scenarios, including handling edge cases like an empty string or an empty character. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
