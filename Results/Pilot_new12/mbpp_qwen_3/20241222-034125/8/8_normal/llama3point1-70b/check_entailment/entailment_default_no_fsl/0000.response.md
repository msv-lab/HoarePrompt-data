Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The code handles all potential cases as described:

1. If `char` appears multiple times in `s`, it removes only the first occurrence.
2. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it removes that occurrence.
3. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns the original string.
4. It also handles edge cases such as an empty string `s` or an empty string `char`.

The logic in the function is sound and aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
