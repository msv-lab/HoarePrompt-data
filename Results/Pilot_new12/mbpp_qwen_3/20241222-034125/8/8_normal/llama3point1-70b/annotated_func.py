#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a substring of `s` that excludes the first and last occurrences of `char`
    else :
        return s
        #`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, `last_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. Either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1. The program returns `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It determines the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first occurrence of `char` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged. The function handles the following cases:
1. Returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
2. Returns a substring of `s` that excludes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
3. Returns the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s` or appears only once.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears multiple times in `s` and removes only the first occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears exactly once in `s` and removes that occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` does not appear in `s` and returns the original string.
- The function correctly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string (though these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the annotations).
