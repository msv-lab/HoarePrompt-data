Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`. The first occurrence and last occurrence of `char` in `s` are not -1, and `first_occurrence` is equal to `last_occurrence`.**
