The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. Based on the given cases:

- Case_1: The function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
- Case_2: The function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the first and last occurrences of `char`.
- Case_3: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, `last_occurrence` is either -1 or the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. Either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1. The function returns `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `char`, and based on certain conditions, return a modified version of the string `s` or the original string `s` itself.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`, and returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed, a substring of `s` excluding the first and last occurrences of `char`, or the original string `s` depending on the occurrences of `char` in `s`.**
