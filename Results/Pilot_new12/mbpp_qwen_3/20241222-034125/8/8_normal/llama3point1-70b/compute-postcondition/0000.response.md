The code `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` searches for the first occurrence of the substring `char` within the string `s` and assigns the index of the first occurrence to the variable `first_occurrence`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be `-1`.

Given the initial state where `s` is a string and `char` is a single character string, the only change is the assignment of the value of `s.find(char)` to `first_occurrence`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.**
