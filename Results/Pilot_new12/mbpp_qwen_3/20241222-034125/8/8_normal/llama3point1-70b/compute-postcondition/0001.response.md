The code `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the last occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be assigned the index of the last occurrence of `char`. If `char` is not found, `last_occurrence` will be assigned `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.**
