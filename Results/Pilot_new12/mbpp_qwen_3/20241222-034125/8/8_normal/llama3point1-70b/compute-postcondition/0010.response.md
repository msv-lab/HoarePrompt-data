Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. It determines the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first occurrence of `char` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged. The function handles the following cases:
1. Returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
2. Returns a substring of `s` that excludes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
3. Returns the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s` or appears only once.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears multiple times in `s` and removes only the first occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` appears exactly once in `s` and removes that occurrence.
- The function correctly handles cases where `char` does not appear in `s` and returns the original string.
- The function correctly handles cases where `s` is an empty string or `char` is an empty string (though these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the annotations).**

Note: The provided code does not handle the case where `char` is an empty string, which should be considered an invalid input. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `s` is an empty string, though this case is covered by the overall postconditions.
