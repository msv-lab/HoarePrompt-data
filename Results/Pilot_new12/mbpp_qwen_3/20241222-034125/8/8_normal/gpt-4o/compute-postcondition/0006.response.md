The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. 

- If the conditions `(first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` are met, the function returns the original string `s`.
- Otherwise, the function returns a new string formed by slicing the initial string `s` and removing the substring from `first_index` to `first_index + last_index - first_index`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and based on specific conditions, either return the original string or a modified version of the string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the conditions `(first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` are true, it returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns a new string formed by removing the substring from the first occurrence of `ch` to the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
