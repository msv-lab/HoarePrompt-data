Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index where `ch` is first found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The condition `(first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` is true.***
