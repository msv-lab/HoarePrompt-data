The code `last_index = s.rfind(ch)` finds the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. The value of `last_index` will be the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or `-1` if `ch` is not found in `s`. The values of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index where `ch` is first found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
