Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s` or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same, it returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns a new string formed by removing the substring from the first occurrence of `ch` to the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. This includes handling cases where `ch` is not found in `s` (in which case both `first_index` and `last_index` will be `-1`), and cases where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same (in which case only one instance of `ch` is removed).**
