The `find` method is called on the string `s` with the argument `ch`, which is a single character string. This method returns the lowest index in the string where the character `ch` is found. If the character `ch` is not found in the string `s`, the method returns `-1`.

Since the initial state does not specify whether the character `ch` is found in the string `s` or not, the output state will reflect both possibilities.

- If `ch` is found in `s`, `first_index` will be assigned the index where `ch` is first found.
- If `ch` is not found in `s`, `first_index` will be assigned `-1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string; `first_index` is either the index where `ch` is first found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
