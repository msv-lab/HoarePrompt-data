Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, covering various scenarios such as no occurrences of the character, single occurrence of the character, and multiple occurrences including cases where the character is at both ends of the string. The function handles all these cases correctly as evidenced by the provided assertions. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
