Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function handles various scenarios correctly:

1. **Removing First and Last Occurrence**: The function works as expected in the given assertions.
2. **No Occurrences of Character**: If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string.
3. **Single Occurrence of Character**: If the character appears only once, the function correctly returns the string without any changes.
4. **Character at Both Ends**: If the character appears at both the start and end of the string, the function correctly removes both occurrences.

The annotated version further clarifies the logic of the function, confirming that it correctly identifies and removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character. There are no contradictions or issues with the provided code based on the problem description and the annotated version.
