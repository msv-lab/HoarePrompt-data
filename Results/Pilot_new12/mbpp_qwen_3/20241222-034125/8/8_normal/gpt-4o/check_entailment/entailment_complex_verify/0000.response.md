Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The annotated version confirms that the function handles various scenarios appropriately, including cases where the character is not found (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`) and cases where the first and last occurrences are the same index (`first_index == last_index`). The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
