Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the provided annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string under all tested conditions. 

- When the character `ch` is not found in the string `s` (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), the function returns the original string `s`.
- When the first and last indices of the character `ch` are the same (`first_index == last_index`), the function also returns the original string `s`.
- In all other cases, the function correctly constructs a new string by removing the characters at the first and last indices of `ch`.

Given the annotated version, which aligns with the provided test cases and logic, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as correct.
