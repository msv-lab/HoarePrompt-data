Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The function handles cases where the character is not found in the string by returning the original string, and it correctly manages cases where the first and last occurrences of the character are at the same index. The output hints align with the function's implementation, confirming its correctness according to the problem description.
