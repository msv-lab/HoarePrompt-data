Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s, ch)` takes two parameters:
   - `s`: A string from which characters are to be removed.
   - `ch`: A single character string whose first and last occurrences are to be removed.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the character `ch` is not found in the string `s` (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), the function returns the original string `s`.
   - If the first and last occurrences of `ch` are at the same position (`first_index == last_index`), the function also returns the original string `s`.

4. **General Case**:
   - If the character `ch` is found multiple times in the string `s` and its first and last occurrences are different positions (`first_index != -1` and `last_index != -1` and `first_index != last_index`), the function constructs a new string by slicing the original string and removing the substring from `first_index` to `first_index + last_index - first_index`.

5. **Assertions Verification**:
   - The provided assertions check various scenarios:
     - Removing 'l' from 'hello' results in 'heo'.
     - Removing 'a' from 'abcda' results in 'bcd'.
     - Removing 'P' from 'PHP' results in 'H'.
   - These cases cover scenarios with multiple occurrences of the character, no occurrences, and single occurrences where the first and last positions are the same.

Since the function handles all specified cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is **True**.
