Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string in all tested cases. It handles the scenario where the character is not found by returning the original string, and it also correctly manages cases where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same index. Given the examples and the logic implemented, the function appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
