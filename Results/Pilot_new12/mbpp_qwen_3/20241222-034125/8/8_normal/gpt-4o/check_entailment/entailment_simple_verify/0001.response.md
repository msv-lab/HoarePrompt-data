Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The annotated version of the code further clarifies the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Specifically, the function handles cases where the character is not found, appears only once, or appears at both ends of the string, all of which are correctly managed. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains valid.
