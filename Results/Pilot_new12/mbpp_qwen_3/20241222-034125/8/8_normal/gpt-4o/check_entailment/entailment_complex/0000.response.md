Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 
2. **Functionality**:
   - The function first identifies the indices of the first and last occurrences of the specified character using `s.find(ch)` and `s.rfind(ch)`.
   - If the character is not found (`-1` for both indices) or the first and last indices are the same, the function returns the original string `s`.
   - If the character is found at different positions, it constructs a new string by concatenating the parts of the original string excluding the substring between the first and last occurrence of the character.

The provided assertions also validate the function against different scenarios, confirming its correctness:
- `func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'`: Removes the first and last 'l' from 'hello'.
- `func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'`: Removes the first and last 'a' from 'abcda'.
- `func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'`: Removes the first and last 'P' from 'PHP'.

Therefore, the function `func_1` consistently removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string, meeting the requirements of the problem description in all tested cases.
