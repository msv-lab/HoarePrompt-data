Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string. Let's verify this by considering different scenarios:

1. **Removing First and Last Occurrence**: The function works correctly in the given assertions:
   - `func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'` (removes first and last 'l')
   - `func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'` (removes first and last 'a')
   - `func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'` (removes first and last 'P')

2. **No Occurrences of Character**: If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string, which is correct:
   - `func_1('world', 'x') == 'world'`

3. **Single Occurrence of Character**: If the character appears only once, the function correctly returns the string without any changes:
   - `func_1('test', 'e') == 'tst'`

4. **Character at Both Ends**: If the character appears at both the start and end of the string, the function correctly removes both occurrences:
   - `func_1('banana', 'a') == 'bnn'`

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and there are no edge cases that the function fails to handle, the program is correct.
