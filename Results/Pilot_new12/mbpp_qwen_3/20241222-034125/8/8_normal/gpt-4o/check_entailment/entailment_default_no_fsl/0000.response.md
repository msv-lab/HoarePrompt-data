Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles all the mentioned cases:

1. If the character `ch` is not found in the string `s`, both `first_index` and `last_index` will be `-1`, and the function will return the original string `s`.
2. If the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same, the function correctly returns a string with only one instance of `ch` removed.
3. If `ch` is found in the string `s`, the function correctly constructs a new string by removing the substring from the first occurrence of `ch` to the last occurrence of `ch`.

The assertions provided in the problem description also validate this behavior. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
