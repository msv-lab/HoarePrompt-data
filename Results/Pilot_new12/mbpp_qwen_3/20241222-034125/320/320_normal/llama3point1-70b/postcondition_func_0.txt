The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as input and returns either the second smallest unique integer from the list or `None`. If the list does not contain at least two distinct integers, the function returns `None`. If the list contains at least two distinct integers, the function first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list. It then checks if the resulting list has at least two elements. If so, it returns the second smallest element from this list of unique integers. If not, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list contains fewer than two distinct integers by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the input list contains exactly two distinct integers by returning the second smallest integer.
- The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would result in `None` being returned due to the initial check for at least two distinct integers.
- The function assumes that the input list contains only integers. No validation or handling for non-integer inputs is provided.
