The code `unique_nums = list(set(nums))` creates a new list `unique_nums` that contains only the unique elements from the original list `nums`. Since `nums` contains at least two distinct integers, the set operation will eliminate any duplicate elements, and the resulting `unique_nums` will be a list of these unique integers.

The initial state is that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct integers. After executing the code, `nums` remains unchanged, but a new list `unique_nums` is created which contains the unique elements of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct integers; `unique_nums` is a list of the unique integers from `nums`.**
