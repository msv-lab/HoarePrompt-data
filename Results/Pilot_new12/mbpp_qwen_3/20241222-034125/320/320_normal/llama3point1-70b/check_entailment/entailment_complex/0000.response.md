Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input (`nums`). According to the problem description, the function should handle cases where the list contains fewer than two distinct integers by returning `None`. The program correctly handles this by converting the list to a set to remove duplicates and then checking if the length of the resulting list is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`.

2. **Finding the Second Smallest Number**: After ensuring there are at least two distinct integers, the function sorts the list of unique integers and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number. This logic aligns with the requirement to find the second smallest unique integer.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function correctly handles the case where the input list contains fewer than two distinct integers.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the input list contains exactly two distinct integers.
   - However, the problem description mentions that the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. While the program returns `None` in such a scenario due to the initial check, this is not explicitly stated as a requirement in the problem description. Given the assumption that the input will be valid, this case can be considered implicitly handled.

4. **Assumption on Input Type**: The problem description assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the program does not need to handle non-integer inputs explicitly, as per the given constraints.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all relevant cases.
