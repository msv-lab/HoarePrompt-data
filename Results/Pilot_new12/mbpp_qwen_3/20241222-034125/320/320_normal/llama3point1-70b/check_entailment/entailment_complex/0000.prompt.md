You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and the list contains at least two distinct integers.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct integers; `unique_nums` is a list of the unique integers from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest integer from the list of unique integers in `unique_nums`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as input and returns either the second smallest unique integer from the list or `None`. If the list does not contain at least two distinct integers, the function returns `None`. If the list contains at least two distinct integers, the function first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list. It then checks if the resulting list has at least two elements. If so, it returns the second smallest element from this list of unique integers. If not, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list contains fewer than two distinct integers by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the input list contains exactly two distinct integers by returning the second smallest integer.
- The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would result in `None` being returned due to the initial check for at least two distinct integers.
- The function assumes that the input list contains only integers. No validation or handling for non-integer inputs is provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
