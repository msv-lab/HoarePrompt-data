Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when the input list is empty. In this case, the function will still attempt to convert the list to a set and then back to a list, which results in an empty list. Since the length of this list is less than 2, the function incorrectly returns `None` even though the input list did not contain at least two distinct integers. This violates the problem description, which requires the function to return `None` for such cases. Therefore, the code is not fully correct according to the given problem description.
