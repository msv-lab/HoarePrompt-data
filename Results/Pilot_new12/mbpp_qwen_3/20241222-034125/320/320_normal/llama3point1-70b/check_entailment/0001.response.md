Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring only unique numbers are considered. It then checks if there are at least two unique numbers before sorting and returning the second element. This approach works for all potential cases:

1. If the list has fewer than 2 unique elements, it returns `None` correctly.
2. If the list has 2 or more unique elements, it sorts them and returns the second smallest element.

Since the function handles all described scenarios without errors, the program is correct.
