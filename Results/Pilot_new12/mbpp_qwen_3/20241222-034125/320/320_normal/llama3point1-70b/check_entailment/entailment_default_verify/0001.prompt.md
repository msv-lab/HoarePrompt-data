You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set`, ensuring only unique numbers are considered. It then checks if there are at least two unique numbers before sorting and returning the second element. This approach works for all potential cases:

1. If the list has fewer than 2 unique elements, it returns `None` correctly.
2. If the list has 2 or more unique elements, it sorts them and returns the second smallest element.

Since the function handles all described scenarios without errors, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as input and returns either the second smallest unique integer from the list or `None`. If the list does not contain at least two distinct integers, the function returns `None`. If the list contains at least two distinct integers, the function first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list. It then checks if the resulting list has at least two elements. If so, it returns the second smallest element from this list of unique integers. If not, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input list contains fewer than two distinct integers by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the input list contains exactly two distinct integers by returning the second smallest integer.
- The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would result in `None` being returned due to the initial check for at least two distinct integers.
- The function assumes that the input list contains only integers. No validation or handling for non-integer inputs is provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
