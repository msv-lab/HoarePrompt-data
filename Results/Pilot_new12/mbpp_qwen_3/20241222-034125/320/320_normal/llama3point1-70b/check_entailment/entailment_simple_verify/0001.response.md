Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem description. 

1. When the list `nums` contains fewer than 2 distinct integers, the function correctly returns `None`.
2. When the list contains 2 or more distinct integers, the function removes duplicates, sorts the remaining unique integers, and returns the second smallest element.

The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected under all conditions mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
