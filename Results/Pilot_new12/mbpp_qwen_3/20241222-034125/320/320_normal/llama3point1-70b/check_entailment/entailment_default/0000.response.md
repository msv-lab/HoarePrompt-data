Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should find the second smallest number in a list. If the list is empty, the function should return `None`. However, the current implementation checks if there are at least two unique numbers in the list, which would return `None` even if the list is empty. This means the function does not correctly handle the edge case where the input list is empty.
