Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` seems to work correctly based on the original assessment, the output hints reveal some potential issues that were not initially considered:

1. The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if there are fewer than two unique numbers, which includes the case of an empty list. Therefore, the function should explicitly check for an empty list and return `None` in that case.
2. The function assumes that the input list contains only integers. While the original assessment did not mention this, the problem description implies that the input should be a list of integers. If non-integer values are passed, the function will convert them to integers (or raise an error if they cannot be converted), which might not be the intended behavior.

Given these points, the original assessment was partially correct but incomplete. The function needs to address the case of an empty list and consider the type of the elements in the list. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
