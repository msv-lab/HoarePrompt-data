Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorting it. It returns the second element in the sorted list if there are more than one unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`. This means that if the input list has fewer than two unique elements, the function will return `None`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list `nums` is empty, the function will return `None` because there are no elements to process.
- If the input list contains only one unique element, the function will also return `None` since the sorted list will have only one element.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for when the input list contains duplicate elements. However, the code inherently handles this by converting the list to a set, which removes duplicates. Therefore, the function will correctly return `None` if all elements in the list are identical.
