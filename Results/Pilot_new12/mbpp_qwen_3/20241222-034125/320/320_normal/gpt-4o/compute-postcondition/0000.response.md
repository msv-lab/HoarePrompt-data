The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` has the following impacts:
- It creates a set from the list `nums`, which removes duplicate elements.
- It sorts the unique elements in ascending order.
- The sorted list of unique elements is assigned to the variable `unique_nums`.

Given the initial state where `nums` is a list of integers, the output state will be:
- `unique_nums` is a list containing the unique elements of `nums`, sorted in ascending order.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not specified, we can represent the final state as follows:

Output State: **`unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`.**
