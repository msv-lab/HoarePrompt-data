Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by removing duplicates and sorting the unique values. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the second element in the sorted list of unique elements if there are at least two unique elements, and `None` otherwise. The function handles all the provided test cases and does not require any additional changes or assumptions based on the given problem description and the nature of the problem.
