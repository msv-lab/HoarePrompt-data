Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique values, and finally returns the second element if it exists. This approach handles all the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2`: The second smallest number is -2.
2. `assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5`: The second smallest number is -0.5.
3. `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None`: Since there is only one unique number, the function correctly returns `None`.
4. `assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None`: Again, since there is only one unique number, the function correctly returns `None`.

Given that the function handles the provided examples and the logic appears sound, it should work correctly for the described problem. There do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given examples and the nature of the problem.
