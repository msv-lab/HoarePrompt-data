Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using a set and then sorting the unique numbers. The function returns the second element in the sorted list if there are at least two unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`. This approach covers various scenarios including lists with duplicates, negative numbers, and equal numbers. The output hints align with this behavior, confirming that the function handles the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
