Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique numbers. It returns the second element in the sorted list if there are more than one unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`. This approach works for all the given test cases:

1. For the input `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the function returns `-2` as the second smallest number.
2. For the input `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the function returns `-0.5` as the second smallest number.
3. For the input `[2, 2]`, the function returns `None` since there is only one unique number.
4. For the input `[2, 2, 2]`, the function also returns `None` for the same reason.

The function handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
