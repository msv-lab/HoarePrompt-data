Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function processes the input list by removing duplicates, sorting the unique values, and returning the second smallest value if it exists. Otherwise, it returns `None`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the second smallest number in a list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including lists with duplicates, negative numbers, and equal numbers, and the function behaves as expected in each case. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
