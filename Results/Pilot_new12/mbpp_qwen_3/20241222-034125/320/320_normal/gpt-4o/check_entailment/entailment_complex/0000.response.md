Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` aims to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. It achieves this by first removing duplicate values using `set(nums)` and then sorting the resulting unique numbers with `sorted()`. By returning the second element (`unique_nums[1]`), it effectively finds the second smallest number. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it returns `None`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The first test case `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]` yields `-2`, which is the second smallest number after removing duplicates and sorting.
   - The second test case `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]` results in `-0.5`, again correctly identifying the second smallest number after handling duplicates.
   - The third test case `[2, 2]` returns `None` because there is only one unique number, matching the expected behavior.
   - The fourth test case `[2, 2, 2]` also returns `None` as there are no other unique elements besides `2`.

3. **Problem Description Compliance**: The problem description requires finding the second smallest number, and the function adheres to this by handling cases with duplicate values and ensuring that the second smallest number is returned when it exists. When the condition is not met (i.e., fewer than two unique elements), it correctly returns `None`.

Thus, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
