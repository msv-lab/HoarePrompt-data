Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Unique Elements**: The function first converts the list into a set (`set(nums)`) to remove any duplicate elements. This ensures that each element in the list is considered at most once, which is necessary for finding the second smallest distinct number.

2. **Sorting**: After converting the list to a set, the elements are sorted (`sorted(set(nums))`). Sorting is crucial for finding the second smallest element.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If there are more than one unique elements (i.e., `len(unique_nums) > 1`), the function returns the second element in the sorted list (`unique_nums[1]`).
   - If there is only one unique element or no unique elements (i.e., the list contains duplicates or is empty after removing duplicates), the function returns `None`.

The provided test cases also align with this logic:
- For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-2`.
- For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
- For `[2, 2]`, the unique sorted list is `[2]`, so the function returns `None`.
- For `[2, 2, 2]`, the unique sorted list is also `[2]`, so again, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list and returns `None` when no such number exists.
