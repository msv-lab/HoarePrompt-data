You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list. Here's why:

1. The function first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. It then sorts the unique numbers.
3. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second element (index 1) from the sorted list.
4. If there is only one unique number or no unique numbers, it returns `None`.

Given the test cases:
- For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-2`.
- For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-0.5`.
- For `[2, 2]`, since all numbers are the same, it returns `None`.
- For `[2, 2, 2]`, again, since all numbers are the same, it returns `None`.

These cases cover scenarios with duplicates, negative numbers, and equal numbers. The function handles these cases appropriately and does not miss any logic or edge cases based on the provided examples. Therefore, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorting it. It returns the second element in the sorted list if there are more than one unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`. This means that if the input list has fewer than two unique elements, the function will return `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
