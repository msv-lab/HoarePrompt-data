Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list. Here's why:

1. The function first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. It then sorts the unique numbers.
3. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second element (index 1) from the sorted list.
4. If there is only one unique number or no unique numbers, it returns `None`.

Given the test cases:
- For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-2`.
- For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-0.5`.
- For `[2, 2]`, since all numbers are the same, it returns `None`.
- For `[2, 2, 2]`, again, since all numbers are the same, it returns `None`.

These cases cover scenarios with duplicates, negative numbers, and equal numbers. The function handles these cases appropriately and does not miss any logic or edge cases based on the provided examples. Therefore, the function is correct.
