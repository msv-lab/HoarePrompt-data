Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality to find the second smallest number in a list. It handles all the test cases provided in the problem description:

1. For the list `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-2`.
2. For the list `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
3. For the list `[2, 2]`, there are no unique elements greater than one, so it returns `None`.
4. For the list `[2, 2, 2]`, again there are no unique elements greater than one, so it returns `None`.

The code converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, sorts the resulting list of unique numbers, and returns the second element if it exists. This approach correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints.
