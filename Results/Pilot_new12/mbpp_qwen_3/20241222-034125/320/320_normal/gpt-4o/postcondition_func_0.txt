The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorting it. It returns the second element in the sorted list if there are more than one unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`. This means that if the input list has fewer than two unique elements, the function will return `None`.
