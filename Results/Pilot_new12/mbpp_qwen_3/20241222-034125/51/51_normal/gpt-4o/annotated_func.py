#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floating-point numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result which is calculated as product / len(numbers)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers or floating-point numbers and returns the average of the logarithm (base 10) of each element in the list. Specifically, it calculates the product of all elements in the list, divides this product by the length of the list, and then computes the base 10 logarithm of this quotient. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning 0, as the division by zero would otherwise raise an error. However, it does not handle cases where any element in the list is non-positive, as the logarithm of such values is undefined.
