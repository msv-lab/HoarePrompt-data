`product` is multiplied by `num`, where `num` is an element from the list `numbers`. Since `numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers and `product` is initially 1, the new value of `product` will be the first element of `numbers`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers that must have at least one element, `product` is the first element of `numbers`.**
