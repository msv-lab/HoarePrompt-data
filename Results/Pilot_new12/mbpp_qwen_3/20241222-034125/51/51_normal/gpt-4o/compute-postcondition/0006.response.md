The code multiplies the current value of `product` by the next element in the `numbers` list. The initial value of `product` is the product of the first two elements in the list. Let's denote the elements of the list as `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` (since the list has at least two elements). Initially, `product` is `numbers[0] * numbers[1]`. After executing the line `product *= num`, `product` will be updated to `product * numbers[2]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `product` is `(numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[2]`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers that must have at least two elements; `product` is (numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[2]**
