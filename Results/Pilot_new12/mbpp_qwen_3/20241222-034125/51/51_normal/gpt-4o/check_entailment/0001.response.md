Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions provided in the code also cover different scenarios including positive numbers, negative numbers, and a list with only one element. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and the problem description is clear and specific, the function should work correctly for any list of numbers. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or missing logic that would cause the function to fail based on the information provided.
