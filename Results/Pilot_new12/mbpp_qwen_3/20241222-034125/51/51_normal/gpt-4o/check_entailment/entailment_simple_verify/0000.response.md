Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotations provide clear descriptions of the state of the program at different points, indicating that the function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
