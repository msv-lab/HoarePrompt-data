Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The examples given cover different scenarios, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and an empty list (though no explicit empty list test was provided, the function should handle it gracefully). Since the function behaves as expected in the given examples and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, we can conclude that the function is correct according to the problem description.
