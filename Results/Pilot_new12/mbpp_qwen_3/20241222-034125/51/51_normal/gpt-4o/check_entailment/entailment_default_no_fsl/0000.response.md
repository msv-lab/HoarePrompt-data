Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the product of all elements in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which is different from the problem description. The problem description states that the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the result by the length of the list. However, the code actually computes the logarithm (base 10) of the quotient after dividing the product by the length of the list. This discrepancy is evident from the output hints, which state that the function calculates the average of the logarithm (base 10) of each element in the list, not the product divided by the length.

To correct the code, it should simply perform the multiplication and division without taking the logarithm. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import math

assert func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)) == -67.2
assert func_1((-10, -20, -30)) == -2000.0
assert func_1((19, 15, 18)) == 1710.0

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

This version of the function will now correctly multiply all the numbers in the list and divide the result by the length of the list.
