Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the result by the length of the list. However, the program calculates the base 10 logarithm of the product of all elements in the list and then divides this logarithm by the length of the list.

Specifically, the problematic line is:
```python
result = math.log10(product) / len(numbers)
```
Instead of the intended operation:
```python
result = product / len(numbers)
```

Thus, the function `func_1` is not performing the multiplication followed by division as required by the problem description. It is instead calculating the logarithm of the product, which changes the nature of the operation entirely. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
