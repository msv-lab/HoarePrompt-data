Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (either integers or floating-point numbers) as input, multiplies all the numbers in the list to get the product, and then divides this product by the length of the list. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. The program does not explicitly validate the input type (it assumes the input is a list), but since we are told to assume the input is valid, this is acceptable.

2. **Multiplication of Elements**: 
   ```python
   product = 1
   for num in numbers:
       product *= num
   ```
   This loop iterates through each element in the list and multiplies them together, correctly computing the product of all elements in the list.

3. **Division by Length**:
   ```python
   result = product / len(numbers)
   ```
   After obtaining the product, the program divides this product by the length of the list, which is the requirement specified in the problem description.

4. **Assertions**:
   The assertions at the beginning of the program check the function `func_1` against known inputs and expected outputs, using `math.isclose` to allow for slight variations due to floating-point arithmetic. These assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases.

Since the program correctly performs the required operation (multiplying all numbers in the list and then dividing by the length of the list) for the given examples and adheres to the problem description's assumptions, the program is correct.
