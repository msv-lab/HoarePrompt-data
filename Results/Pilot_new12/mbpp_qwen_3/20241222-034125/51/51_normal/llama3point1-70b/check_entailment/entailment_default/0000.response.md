Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case of an empty list by returning 0.0, which is the expected behavior since multiplying by 0 results in 0, and dividing 0 by the length of an empty list (which is 0) results in 0.0. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input as per the problem description.
