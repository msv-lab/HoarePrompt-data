Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotations indicate that `numbers` is a list of integers, and after the for loop, `product` holds the product of all integers in `numbers`. Finally, the function returns the product divided by the length of the list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
