Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or special conditions that this function is missing. For any list of numbers, the function will compute the product and then divide it by the length of the list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.
