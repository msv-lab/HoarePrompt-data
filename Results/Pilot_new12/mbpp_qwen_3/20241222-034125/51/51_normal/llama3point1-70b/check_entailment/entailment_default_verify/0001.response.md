Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The output hints further confirm this by mentioning that the function handles the case of an empty list appropriately by returning 0.0. Since there are no contradictions between the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate.
