Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a list of numbers, calculates the product of all the numbers in the list, and then divides this product by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles an edge case of an empty list by returning 0.0, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. There is no missing functionality or logic error in the provided code, and it correctly performs the described operation for any valid input list of numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
