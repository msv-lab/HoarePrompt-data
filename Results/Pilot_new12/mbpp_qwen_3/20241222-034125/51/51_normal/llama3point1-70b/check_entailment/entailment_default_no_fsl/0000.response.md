Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The code handles the edge case of an empty list by returning 0.0, as dividing by the length (which is 0) results in 0.0. Since the code matches the problem description for every potential case, the program is correct.
