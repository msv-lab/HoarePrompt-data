Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: Multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.
2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`numbers`) as input.
   - It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
   - A for loop iterates through each number in the list, multiplying the current value of `product` by the number.
   - After the loop, the function returns the `product` divided by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`).

Given the assumptions that the input will always be a valid list of integers, the program will always perform the required operation correctly. Each step aligns with the problem description:

- Multiplying all the numbers in the list ensures the product is calculated.
- Dividing the product by the length of the list gives the average of the product of all numbers (which isn't the exact requirement but still performs the specified operation).

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
