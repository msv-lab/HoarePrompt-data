Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This matches the problem description exactly. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, calculating the product of all integers in the list and then dividing this product by the length of the list. The function handles the case of an empty list by returning 0.0, which is the correct mathematical result for such a case. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
