Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then divides this product by the length of the list. The function returns the resulting value. Potential edge cases include an empty list, in which case the function would return 0.0, as dividing by the length (which is 0) would result in 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly performs the described operation.**
