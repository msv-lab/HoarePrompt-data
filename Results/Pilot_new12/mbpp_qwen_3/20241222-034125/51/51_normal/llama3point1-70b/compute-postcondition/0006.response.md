`product` is multiplied by `num` squared. The previous value of `product` is the product of its previous value and `num` squared, and now it is updated to be the previous `product` value multiplied by `num` squared again. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer remaining, `product` is the product of its previous value and `num` squared twice.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer remaining, `product` is the product of its previous value and `num` squared twice**
