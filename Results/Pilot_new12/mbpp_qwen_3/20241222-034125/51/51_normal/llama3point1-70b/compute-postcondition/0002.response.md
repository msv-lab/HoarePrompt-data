`product` is multiplied by `num`. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `product` before this operation, but it is known that `numbers` is a list of integers and `num` is one of the integers in that list. After the multiplication, `product` will be updated to its current value multiplied by `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer; `product` is the product of its previous value and `num`.**
