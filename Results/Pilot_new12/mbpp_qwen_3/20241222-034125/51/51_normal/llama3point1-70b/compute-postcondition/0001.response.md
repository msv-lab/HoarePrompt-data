According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will execute if the `numbers` list contains at least one integer.

Before the loop starts, `product` is 1. The value of `product` itself does not affect whether the loop will execute, but the presence of elements in the `numbers` list does.

So, for the loop to be executed, the `numbers` list must contain at least one integer. 

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer**
