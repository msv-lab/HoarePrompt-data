The code multiplies the `product` by `num`. The initial state is that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one remaining integer, and `product` is the product of its previous value and `num`.

After executing the line `product *= num`, the value of `product` is updated to be the previous value of `product` multiplied by `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer remaining, `product` is the product of its previous value and `num` squared.**
