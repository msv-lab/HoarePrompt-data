#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element can be any type that is hashable.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of 'element' in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple `tup`. The function performs the following actions:
- It counts the occurrences of the specified `element` within the tuple `tup`.
- It returns the count as an integer.
Potential edge cases include:
- If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function will return 0 since no elements match the given `element`.
- If the `element` is not present in the tuple `tup`, the function will also return 0.
