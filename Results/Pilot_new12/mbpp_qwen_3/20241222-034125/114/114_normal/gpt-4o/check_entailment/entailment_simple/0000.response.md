Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element as inputs and returns the count of occurrences of the element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The provided test cases assert that the function behaves as expected for different inputs:

- The first assertion checks the count of an element (4) that is not present in the tuple, which correctly returns 0.
- The second assertion checks the count of an element (10) that appears three times in the tuple, which correctly returns 3.
- The third assertion checks the count of an element (8) that appears four times in the tuple, which correctly returns 4.

Since the function `func_1` uses the `count` method of tuples to achieve the desired functionality and the test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
