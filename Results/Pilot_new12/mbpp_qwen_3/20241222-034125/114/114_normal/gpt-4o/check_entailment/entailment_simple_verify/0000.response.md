Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function signature in the provided code does not match the problem description. The problem description requires the function to take two parameters: a tuple and an element. However, the provided function `func_1` only takes one parameter (`tup`). Although the annotated version clarifies the state of the program and the operation performed, it does not change the fact that the function does not adhere to the specified requirements in the problem description. Therefore, the program remains incorrect.
