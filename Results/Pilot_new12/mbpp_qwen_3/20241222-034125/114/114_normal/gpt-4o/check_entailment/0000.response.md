Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses the `count` method of the tuple, which is correct for counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple. However, the function signature in the problem description specifies that the function should take two parameters: a tuple and an element. The provided solution only takes one parameter (`tup`), which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
