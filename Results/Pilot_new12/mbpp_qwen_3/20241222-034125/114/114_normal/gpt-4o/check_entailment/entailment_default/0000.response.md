Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to achieve this, which is the correct approach. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

- When the element is not present in the tuple, it returns 0.
- When the element is present multiple times in the tuple, it returns the correct count.

The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, counting the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle, such as an empty tuple or an element not present in the tuple. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case described.
