Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as inputs and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.

The assertions provided in the comments check different scenarios:
1. An assertion with an element (`4`) that is not in the tuple, resulting in a count of `0`.
2. An assertion with an element (`10`) that appears multiple times in the tuple, resulting in a count of `3`.
3. An assertion with an element (`8`) that appears multiple times in the tuple, resulting in a count of `4`.

These checks cover the general case and the edge case where the element is not found in the tuple, returning `0`. Additionally, the function correctly handles the scenario where the tuple is empty, as the `count` method would also return `0` in such a case.

Since the function behaves as expected for all given test cases and follows the problem description accurately, the program is correct.
