Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. The assertions provided in the problem description cover several scenarios:

1. An element that appears multiple times (element `8`).
2. An element that appears once (element `10`).
3. An element that does not appear in the tuple (element `4`).

Since the function works as expected for these cases and handles the potential edge case of an empty tuple (which would also return `0`), the program is correct.
