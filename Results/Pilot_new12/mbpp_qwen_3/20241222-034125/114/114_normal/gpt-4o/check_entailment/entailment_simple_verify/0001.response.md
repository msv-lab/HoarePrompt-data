Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function `tup.count(element)` is used to achieve this, which is the correct approach. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including an element not present in the tuple and elements that appear multiple times. The annotations clarify that the function expects a tuple and an element that is hashable, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
