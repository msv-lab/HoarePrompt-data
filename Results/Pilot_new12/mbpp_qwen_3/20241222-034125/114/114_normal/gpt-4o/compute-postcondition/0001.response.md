The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple where each element is hashable, and `element`, which can be any type that is hashable. The function returns the count of `element` in the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element, and return the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple.
