Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple `tup`. The function performs the following actions:
- It counts the occurrences of the specified `element` within the tuple `tup`.
- It returns the count as an integer.
Potential edge cases include:
- If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function will return 0 since no elements match the given `element`.
- If the `element` is not present in the tuple `tup`, the function will also return 0.**

No additional functionality or missing logic was found based on the provided code and annotations.
