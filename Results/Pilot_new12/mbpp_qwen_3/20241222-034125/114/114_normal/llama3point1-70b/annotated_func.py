#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is a hashable object.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the number of times 'elem' appears in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`. It returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. This includes the case where `elem` does not appear in `tup`, in which case the function returns 0. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.
