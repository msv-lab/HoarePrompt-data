The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elem`, which is a hashable object. The function returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem`, and return the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`.
