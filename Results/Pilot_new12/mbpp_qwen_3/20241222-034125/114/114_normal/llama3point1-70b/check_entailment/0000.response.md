Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of an element in a given tuple. This method will handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as empty tuples, tuples with no occurrences of the element, and tuples with multiple occurrences of the element. Since the function behaves as expected for all tested scenarios, the program is correct.
