Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count how many times `elem` appears in `tup` and returns this count. Since the problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple, and the provided function does exactly that, the program is correct.
