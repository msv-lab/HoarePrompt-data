Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The output hints further confirm that the function handles all relevant cases, including when the element does not appear in the tuple, returning 0 as expected. Since the problem description and the code align perfectly, and there are no mentioned edge cases or issues that contradict the original assessment, the original correctness evaluation remains valid.
