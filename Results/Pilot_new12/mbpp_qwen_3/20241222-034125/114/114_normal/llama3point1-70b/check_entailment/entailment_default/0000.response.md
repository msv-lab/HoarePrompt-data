Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. This method handles all potential cases, including when the element does not appear in the tuple (returning 0 in such cases). There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code, and it aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
