Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The annotations confirm that the function handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement, including cases where the element does not appear in the tuple, returning 0 in such cases. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotations that would suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
