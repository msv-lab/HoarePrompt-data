Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The function adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases. Since the `count` method handles all edge cases (such as empty tuples, tuples with no occurrences of the element, and tuples with multiple occurrences of the element), the function will work as expected for any valid input.
