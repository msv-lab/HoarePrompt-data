Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of an element within the tuple. The annotation clarifies that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object, which aligns with the requirements for using the `count` method. Given the provided code and the assumption of valid inputs, the program meets the problem description and behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
