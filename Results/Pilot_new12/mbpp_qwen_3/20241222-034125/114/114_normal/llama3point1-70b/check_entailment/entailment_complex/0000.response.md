Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a hashable object `elem` as inputs. It returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup` using the built-in method `count()`. This method will return 0 if `elem` does not appear in `tup`. The function does not include any edge cases or additional functionality beyond what is required, which is consistent with the assumption that the input will be valid. Therefore, the function correctly implements the described behavior for all potential valid cases.
