Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The annotations specify that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is a hashable object, which aligns with the expected inputs for a tuple. The function works as intended for all valid inputs, handling cases such as empty tuples and tuples with multiple occurrences of the element. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is justified.
