The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). There are no edge cases to consider since the code directly computes and returns the value \(2^{(n-1)}\) without any additional checks or modifications. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable holding the return value contains \(2^{(n-1)}\).
