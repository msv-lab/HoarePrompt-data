Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This can be derived from the binomial theorem properties. For any positive integer \(n\), the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients is equal to \(2^{n-1}\).

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4)` returns \(2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8\)
- `func_1(6)` returns \(2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32\)
- `func_1(2)` returns \(2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2\)

The function works as expected for these inputs, and since the binomial coefficient property holds for all positive integers, the function will work correctly for any valid input \(n\). Therefore, the program is correct.
