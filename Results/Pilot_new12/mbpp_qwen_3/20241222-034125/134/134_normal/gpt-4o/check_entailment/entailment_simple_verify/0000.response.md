Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided test cases (`func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, `func_1(2) == 2`) validate this behavior. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support this correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
