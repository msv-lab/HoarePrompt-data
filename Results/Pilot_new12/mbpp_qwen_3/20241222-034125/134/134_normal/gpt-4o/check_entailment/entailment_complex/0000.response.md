Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). It turns out that the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) is indeed \( 2^{(n-1)} \), as proven by the binomial theorem. 

The function `func_1` takes a positive integer \( n \) and returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which matches the requirement. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:

- For \( n = 4 \), the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients is \( 2^3 = 8 \).
- For \( n = 6 \), the sum is \( 2^5 = 32 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 2^1 = 2 \).

Since the function meets the requirement for all tested cases and the problem description aligns with the implemented logic, the program is correct.
