Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. For a given positive integer \( n \), the function `func_1` calculates and returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \). This matches the pattern observed in the provided assertions: `func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, and `func_1(2) == 2`. The formula \( 2^{(n-1)} \) accurately represents the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given \( n \). Since the function directly computes and returns the correct value for the given assertions and the general formula, the code is correct for every potential case.
