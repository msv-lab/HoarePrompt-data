Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements the function to find the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\) by returning \(2^{(n-1)}\). The provided output hints confirm that the function directly computes and returns the value \(2^{(n-1)}\) for the given input \(n\). The test cases also validate the correctness of the implementation. Since the problem description asks for the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients, and the function correctly implements this, the program meets the requirements as stated.
