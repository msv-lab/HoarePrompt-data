Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). This value corresponds to the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n`.

For a positive integer \(n\), the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices can be derived from the binomial theorem. Specifically, the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices is equal to \(2^{n-1}\). Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly calculates this sum.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4)` should return \(2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8\)
- `func_1(6)` should return \(2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32\)
- `func_1(2)` should return \(2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2\)

All these cases are handled correctly by the function. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
