Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided test cases validate the function's correctness. Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
