Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is not the sum of even index binomial coefficients. For example, for \(n = 4\), the binomial coefficients are \([1, 4, 6, 4, 1]\). The even indices are 0 and 2, corresponding to the values 1 and 6. The sum of these values is \(1 + 6 = 7\), not \(2^{(4-1)} = 8\). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
