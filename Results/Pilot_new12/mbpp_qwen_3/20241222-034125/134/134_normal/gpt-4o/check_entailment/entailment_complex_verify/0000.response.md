Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The annotated version supports that the program correctly implements the required functionality, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
