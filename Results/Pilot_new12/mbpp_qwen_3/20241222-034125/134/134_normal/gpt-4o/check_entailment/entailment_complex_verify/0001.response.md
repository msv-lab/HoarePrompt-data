Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The provided test cases and the binomial theorem properties validate this. The annotated version supports that the function works as intended, and there are no issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
