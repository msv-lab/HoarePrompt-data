Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\) for a given positive integer \(n\), which represents the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients. The output hints confirm that the function directly computes and returns the value \(2^{(n-1)}\) without any additional checks or modifications, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases (`func_1(4) == 8`, `func_1(6) == 32`, `func_1(2) == 2`) also validate the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
