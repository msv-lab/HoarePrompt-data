Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). This is based on the property that the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1 + 1)^n\) is \(2^{(n-1)}\).

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4)` returns \(2^{3} = 8\)
- `func_1(6)` returns \(2^{5} = 32\)
- `func_1(2)` returns \(2^{1} = 2\)

These results align with the problem description, and no other edge cases or inputs were provided that would contradict this behavior. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for all tested cases and follows the problem description accurately.
