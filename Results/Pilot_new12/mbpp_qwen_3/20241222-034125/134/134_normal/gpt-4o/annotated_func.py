#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1) where n is a positive integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). There are no edge cases to consider since the code directly computes and returns the value \(2^{(n-1)}\) without any additional checks or modifications. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable holding the return value contains \(2^{(n-1)}\).
