The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` updates the value of `sum` by adding the combination of `n` and `i`. Given that `i` was previously incremented by 1 and is now an even number, the updated state involves updating `sum` with this new combination value.

Let's break it down:
1. `i` is incremented by 1 and is now an even number.
2. `sum` is updated by adding the combination value `math.comb(n, i)`.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains the same; `i` is the next even integer after being incremented by 1; `sum` is the previous sum plus the value of `math.comb(n, i)` where `i` is the next even integer.**
