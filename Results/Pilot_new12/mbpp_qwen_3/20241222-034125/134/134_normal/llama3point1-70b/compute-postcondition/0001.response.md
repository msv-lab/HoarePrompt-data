Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop structure**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `n` inclusive.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, the expression inside `range()` must evaluate to a non-empty sequence. In other words, `n + 1` must be greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `n` is a positive integer: This ensures that `n > 0`.
   - `sum` is 0: This value is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition but could be important if there were additional operations involving `sum` within the loop body.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` will always be greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute.

5. **State the necessary adjustments**: Given that `n` being a positive integer ensures the loop will execute, no additional state adjustments are needed beyond the given information.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, sum is 0**
