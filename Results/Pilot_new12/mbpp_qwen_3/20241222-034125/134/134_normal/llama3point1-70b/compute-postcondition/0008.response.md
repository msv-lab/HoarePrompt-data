Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
     - \( n \) is a positive integer.
     - \( \text{sum} \) is the sum of \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) where \( i \) is the next even integer after the previous even \( i \). If \( i \% 2 == 0 \) is true, \( \text{sum} \) remains unchanged.

2. **Analyze the Loop:**
   - The loop is defined as:
     ```
     for i in range(n + 1):
     ```
   - This means \( i \) starts from 0 and goes up to \( n \).

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) would have been the largest even number such that \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) was included in the sum. For the loop to continue, \( i \) must be incremented to the next value in the range \( [0, n] \).
   - Since \( i \) increments by 1 each time, if the previous \( i \) was an even number, the next \( i \) will be odd. After the next iteration, \( i \) will become the next even number.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - \( n \) remains the same because it is the upper bound of the range.
   - \( \text{sum} \) will include the next term in the sequence \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) where \( i \) is the next even integer.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state will have \( i \) incremented by 1 and checked to be even, and \( \text{sum} \) will include the next combination term.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- \( n \) remains the same.
- \( i \) is incremented by 1.
- \( \text{sum} \) includes the next combination term, \( \text{math.comb}(n, i) \) where \( i \) is now the next even integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` where `i` is the next even integer after the previous even `i` and `i` is incremented by 1.**
