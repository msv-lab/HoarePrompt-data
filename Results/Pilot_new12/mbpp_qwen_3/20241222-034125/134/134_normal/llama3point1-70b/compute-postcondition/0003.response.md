`sum` is updated by adding `math.comb(n, i)` to its current value. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is an integer such that `i % 2 == 0`, the value of `math.comb(n, i)` is a specific combination value. However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `i`, we can represent `math.comb(n, i)` as it is. The `sum` variable is updated, but the initial state's other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, sum is 0 + math.comb(n, i), i is an integer such that i % 2 == 0**
