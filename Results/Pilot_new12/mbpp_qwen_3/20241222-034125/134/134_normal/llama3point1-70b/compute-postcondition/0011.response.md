Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

### Key Points:
1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
2. For each even `i`, `math.comb(n, i)` is added to `sum`.

### Analysis:
- If `n` is a positive integer, the loop will always run at least once (from `i = 0`).
- Each time the loop runs, if `i` is even, `math.comb(n, i)` is added to `sum`.
- After all iterations, `sum` will contain the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will be the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`.

**Output State:** **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`.**
