The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is the next even integer after the previous even `i`, the exact values of `n` and `i` are not specified, but we know `sum` was initially 0. Therefore, `sum` now becomes `math.comb(n, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is `math.comb(n, i)`, `i` is the next even integer after the previous even `i`**
