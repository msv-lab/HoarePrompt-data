Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices up to `n`. Specifically, it computes the sum of \(\binom{n}{i}\) for all even values of \(i\) where \(0 \leq i \leq n\). The function returns this calculated sum. The function does not handle non-integer or negative inputs for `n`; if such values are passed, the behavior is undefined. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.**
