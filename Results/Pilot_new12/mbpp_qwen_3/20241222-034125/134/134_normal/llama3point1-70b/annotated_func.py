#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return sum
    #The program returns the value of the variable `sum`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices up to `n`. Specifically, it computes the sum of \(\binom{n}{i}\) for all even values of \(i\) where \(0 \leq i \leq n\). The function returns this calculated sum. The function does not handle non-integer or negative inputs for `n`; if such values are passed, the behavior is undefined. No missing functionality is noted in the provided code.
