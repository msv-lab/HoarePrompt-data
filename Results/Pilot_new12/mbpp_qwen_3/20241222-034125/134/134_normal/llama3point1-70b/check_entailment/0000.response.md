Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The program iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This approach follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all positive integers \( n \). There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this program would fail based on the given description.
