Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through each index from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even using `i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This approach is valid and works for all positive integers \( n \) as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that this program would fail to handle based on the given logic.
