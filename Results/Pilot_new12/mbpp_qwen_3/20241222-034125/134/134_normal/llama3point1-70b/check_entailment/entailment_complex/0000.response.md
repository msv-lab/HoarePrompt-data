Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for even indices up to `n`. Specifically, it computes the sum of \(\binom{n}{i}\) for all even values of \(i\) where \(0 \leq i \leq n\).

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function expects a positive integer `n` as input. While the problem description does not explicitly mention handling invalid inputs (negative integers or non-integers), the provided solution assumes that the input will be valid and does not include explicit error handling for such cases. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program is correct.

2. **Loop and Condition**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range from `0` to `n` inclusive. It checks if the index `i` is even using the condition `if i % 2 == 0`. For each even index, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{i}\) to the variable `sum`.

3. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns the accumulated sum.

Since the program accurately performs the required task and handles the input as specified, it is correct according to the problem description.
