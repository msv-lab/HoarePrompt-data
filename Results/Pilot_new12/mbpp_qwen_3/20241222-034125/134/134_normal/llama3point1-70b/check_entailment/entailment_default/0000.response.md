Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through all integers from \( 0 \) to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even using \( i \% 2 == 0 \), and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{i}\) to the sum. The output hints confirm that the function calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices up to \( n \). Since the problem description and the function implementation align, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases noted in the hints, the program is correct.
