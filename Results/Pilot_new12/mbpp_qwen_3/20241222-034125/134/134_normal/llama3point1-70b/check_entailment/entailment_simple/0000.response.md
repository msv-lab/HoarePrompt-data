Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition and Input Validation**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer as per the problem description. No explicit validation is needed since the problem description assumes valid input.

2. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. This is appropriate for accumulating the sum of binomial coefficients.

3. **Loop Through Indices**: The `for` loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n` (inclusive). For each index `i`, the program checks if `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum`.

4. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns the computed sum, which is the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any deviation from the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
