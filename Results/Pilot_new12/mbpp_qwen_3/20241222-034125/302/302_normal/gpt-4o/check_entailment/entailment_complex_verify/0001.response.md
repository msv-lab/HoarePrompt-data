Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including the target number appearing multiple times, being at the beginning or end of the array, and not being present in the array. 

The annotated version further supports this by detailing the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The function correctly updates the `low` and `high` pointers to narrow down the search range and sets `result` to the index of the target when found. The function also returns `-1` appropriately when the target is not found, ensuring the function meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
