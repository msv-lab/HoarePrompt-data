You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The given test cases cover various scenarios, including the target number appearing multiple times and the target number being present at different positions within the array. 

To ensure the function works correctly for all potential cases, we can consider additional test cases:

1. When the target number is at the beginning of the array.
2. When the target number is at the end of the array.
3. When the target number is not present in the array.
4. When the array contains only one element.

Let's analyze these cases:

1. **Target number at the beginning:**
   ```
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 1) == 0
   ```

2. **Target number at the end:**
   ```
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 9) == 8
   ```

3. **Target number not present:**
   ```
   assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 7) == -1
   ```

4. **Array with only one element:**
   ```
   assert func_1([5], 5) == 0
   ```

The function correctly handles all these cases without issues. Therefore, the provided function is correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` in the list. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of the `target` in the list; otherwise, it returns -1. The function handles the case where the initial value of `high` is -1, indicating that the search range is invalid, by immediately returning -1 without further processing. This ensures that the function correctly indicates that the target is not found when the search range is invalid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
