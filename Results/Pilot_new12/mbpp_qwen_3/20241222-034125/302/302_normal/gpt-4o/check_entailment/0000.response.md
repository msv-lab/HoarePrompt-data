Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function handles the following cases:

1. When the target is found at multiple indices, it returns the index of the first occurrence (e.g., the first test case).
2. When the target is not present in the array, it returns -1 (as seen in the third test case).

The implementation uses a standard binary search approach but ensures that when the middle element is equal to the target, it continues to search in the lower half of the array to find the first occurrence. This ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases within the constraints of the problem description.
