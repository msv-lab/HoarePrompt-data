Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly handles the binary search process and updates the `result` variable when the `target` is found. The code also properly handles cases where the `target` is not present in the array by setting `result` to -1 if the search range becomes invalid. The examples provided in the output hints and the assertions in the problem description cover various scenarios, including the presence of multiple occurrences of the target number and different positions of the target number within the array. Therefore, the code appears to meet the requirements for every potential case.
