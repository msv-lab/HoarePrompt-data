Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the execution of the loop, which aligns with the behavior of the binary search algorithm.

- The function initializes `low` and `high` to define the search range.
- When `arr[mid] == target`, the function updates `result` to `mid` and narrows the search range by setting `high = mid - 1` to search for earlier occurrences.
- When `arr[mid] < target`, the function narrows the search range by setting `low = mid + 1`.
- When `arr[mid] > target`, the function narrows the search range by setting `high = mid - 1`.

The provided assertions cover various scenarios, and the annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of the target number. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
