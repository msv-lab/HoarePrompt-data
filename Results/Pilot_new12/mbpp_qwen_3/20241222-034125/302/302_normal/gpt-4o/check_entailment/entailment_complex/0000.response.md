Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a sorted array (`arr`) and a target integer (`target`), and return the index of the first occurrence of the target if it exists; otherwise, it should return -1.
2. **Implementation**: The function uses a binary search approach to efficiently locate the target in the sorted array. The key aspects of the implementation are:
   - The initialization of `low` to 0 and `high` to `len(arr) - 1` sets up the bounds for the search.
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`, ensuring that the search space is explored completely.
   - When `arr[mid]` equals the target, the function updates `result` to `mid` and narrows the search to the lower half by setting `high = mid - 1`. This ensures that the first occurrence is found.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, the search moves to the upper half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, the search moves to the lower half by setting `high = mid - 1`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the initial value of `high` is -1, which indicates that the search range is invalid. In this case, the function immediately returns -1 without further processing, which aligns with the requirement to indicate that the target is not found when the search range is invalid.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs, thus making the program correct according to the problem description.
