Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function handles the search range validation properly and returns the correct index or -1 if the target is not found. The additional test cases mentioned in the original assessment also cover various scenarios, ensuring the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
