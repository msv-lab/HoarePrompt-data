Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
2. **Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (the sorted array) and `target` (the number to find).
   - It uses binary search to efficiently locate the target number.
   - When `arr[mid] == target`, it updates `result` to `mid` and continues searching in the left half (`high = mid - 1`) to ensure it finds the first occurrence.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, it searches in the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
   - If `arr[mid] > target`, it searches in the left half (`high = mid - 1`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the target is not found, `result` remains `-1` and is returned at the end of the function.
   - The loop ensures that once the target is found, it stops searching in the right half, thus returning the first occurrence.

Given the assumptions about valid inputs, the program correctly follows the problem description in all cases.
