Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function `func_1` correctly handles the search and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target number, or -1 if the target is not found. The while loop condition `low <= high` ensures that the search continues until the target is found or the search range is invalid. The logic inside the loop also correctly updates the search range to narrow down the possible positions of the target. Given the provided assertions and the output hints, the code appears to work correctly for the specified problem description and potential cases.
