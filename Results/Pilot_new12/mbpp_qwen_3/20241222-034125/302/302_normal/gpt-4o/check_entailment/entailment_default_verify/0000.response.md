Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints also accurately describe the behavior of the function, including its handling of cases where the target is found multiple times and where the target is not present in the array. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, or -1 if the target is not found. The original assessment correctly notes that the function handles these cases appropriately, and the output hints support this claim. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
