Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations provided confirm that the function handles the following cases correctly:

1. When the target is found at multiple indices, it returns the index of the first occurrence. For instance, in the first test case, the target `5` appears multiple times, and the function returns the index `1`, which is the first occurrence.
2. When the target is not present in the array, it returns `-1`. The second test case demonstrates this scenario, where `5` is present but not at the second position, so the function correctly returns `-1`.

The annotations also indicate that the function correctly adjusts the `high` pointer to search in the lower half of the array when the middle element is equal to the target, ensuring that the first occurrence is found. The overall logic of the function aligns with the problem description, and the provided test cases validate its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
