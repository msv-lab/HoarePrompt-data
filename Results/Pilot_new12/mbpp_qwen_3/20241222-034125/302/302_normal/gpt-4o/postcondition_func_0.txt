The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` in the list. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of the `target` in the list; otherwise, it returns -1. The function handles the case where the initial value of `high` is -1, indicating that the search range is invalid, by immediately returning -1 without further processing. This ensures that the function correctly indicates that the target is not found when the search range is invalid.
