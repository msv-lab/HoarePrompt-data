The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `result`. No other changes are made to the variables. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, and `high` is `len(arr) - 1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
