Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- **`arr`**: A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **`target`**: An integer we are searching for in the list.
- **`result`**: Set to `mid` if `arr[mid] == target`, otherwise `-1`.
- **`low`** and **`high`**: Adjusted based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `target`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while low <= high:
```

### Previous Iteration State:
- If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
- If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains unchanged.
- If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`.
- In all cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.

### Analysis:
To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, the condition `low <= high` must hold true. We need to ensure that this condition is met:

1. **If `arr[mid] == target`:**
   - `result` is set to `mid`.
   - `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
   - The new values of `low` and `high` are `low = low` and `high = mid - 1`.
   - For `low <= high` to hold, `mid - 1` must be greater than or equal to `low`.

2. **If `arr[mid] < target`:**
   - `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`.
   - `high` remains unchanged.
   - The new values of `low` and `high` are `low = ((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high = high`.
   - For `low <= high` to hold, `((low + high) // 2) + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`.

3. **If `arr[mid] >= target`:**
   - `low` remains unchanged.
   - `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`.
   - The new values of `low` and `high` are `low = low` and `high = low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`.
   - For `low <= high` to hold, `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1` must be greater than or equal to `low`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to continue executing, the condition `low <= high` must hold true. This means that the current value of `high` should be such that when combined with `low`, the inequality `low <= high` is satisfied.

### Final State Adjustment:
- Since `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `high` is set in a way that maintains the condition `low <= high`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`. In all cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`.**

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`; if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains unchanged; if `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`; in all cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`.**
