The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. The function returns -1 if the target is not found in the list. Additionally, the initial value of `high` is -1, indicating that the search range is invalid.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return -1 if the target is not found in the list.
