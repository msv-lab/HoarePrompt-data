Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is -1, `result` is -1 if the target is not found, otherwise `result` is the index of `target` in `arr`, `low` and `high` will be such that `low > high`.** 

Explanation:
- After the loop has executed, the variable `low` will always be greater than `high` because the loop continues only as long as `low <= high`. This indicates that the target was not found within the range specified by `low` and `high`.
- The variable `result` will be the index of the target if the target is found in the array during the loop, otherwise, it will remain -1.
- The variables `arr` and `target` do not change within the loop and retain their initial states.
- The variables `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparisons made during each iteration of the loop until they cross each other, indicating that the target is either found or not present in the array.
