The code assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `result`. The previous value of `result` was `arr[mid]`, and since `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, `result` now holds the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is `mid`, `mid` is (0 + len(`arr`) - 1) // 2, and `arr[mid]` is equal to `target**
