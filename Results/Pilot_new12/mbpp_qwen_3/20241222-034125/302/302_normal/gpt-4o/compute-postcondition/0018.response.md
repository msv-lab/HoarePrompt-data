The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `high`, `result`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `low` is ((low + high) // 2) + 1; `high` remains unchanged; `result` is -1 if the target is not found; `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
