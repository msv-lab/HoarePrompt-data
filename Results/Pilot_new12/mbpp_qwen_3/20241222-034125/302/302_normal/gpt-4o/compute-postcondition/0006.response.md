The code assigns `mid - 1` to `high`. Given that `mid` was `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2` and `arr[mid]` was equal to `target`, this means that the target was found at the middle index. After the assignment, `high` is now set to `mid - 1`, which is the index just before the middle element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `mid - 1`, `result` is `mid`, `mid` is `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`**
