Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, otherwise `result` is set to `mid` when `arr[mid] == target`; `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`; `mid` is recalculated as either `(low + high) // 2` or `(low + (mid - 1)) // 2` depending on the condition, ensuring `low <= high`.***
