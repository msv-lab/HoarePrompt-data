Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, otherwise `result` is set to `mid` when `arr[mid] == target`, `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2` or `(low + (mid - 1)) // 2` ensuring `low <= high`.**
