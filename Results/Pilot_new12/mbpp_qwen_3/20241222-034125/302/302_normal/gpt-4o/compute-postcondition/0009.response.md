The code sets `low` to `mid + 1`. Given that `arr[mid] < target` and `low` was initially 0 and `high` was set to `len(arr) - 1`, the condition `arr[mid] < target` means that `target` is expected to be in the upper half of the array. After setting `low` to `mid + 1`, the new range for the binary search will be from `low` to `high`. Since `arr[mid] < target`, `low` is now `mid + 1`, which is effectively `low = (0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
