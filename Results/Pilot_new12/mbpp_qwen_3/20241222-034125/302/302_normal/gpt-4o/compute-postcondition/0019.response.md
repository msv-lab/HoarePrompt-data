The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. The initial value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so the new value of `high` is `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`.

Let's denote the initial value of `low` as `l` and the initial value of `high` as `h`. Therefore, the new value of `high` is:

\[
\text{new\_high} = l + \left(\frac{l + h}{2}\right) - 1
\]

Since the exact initial values of `low` and `high` are not provided, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `low` is unchanged; `high` is `l + (l + h) // 2 - 1`; `result` is `-1` if the target is not found; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`**
