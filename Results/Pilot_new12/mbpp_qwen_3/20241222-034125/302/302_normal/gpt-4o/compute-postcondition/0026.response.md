The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and that `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`. Since `low` is now `mid + 1`, this implies that `mid + 1 <= high`, which was already true because `low` was initially calculated such that `low <= high`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `arr` is still a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` remains an integer.
- `result` is still `-1` if the target is not found and is set to `mid` when `arr[mid] == target`.
- `high` remains unchanged and is updated based on the conditions mentioned.
- `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, but since `low` has changed, `mid` will also change accordingly.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `result` is -1 if the target is not found, otherwise it is set to `mid` when `arr[mid] == target`; `low` is `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged and is updated based on the conditions; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
