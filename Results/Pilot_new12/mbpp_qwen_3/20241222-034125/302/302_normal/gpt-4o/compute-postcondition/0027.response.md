The code `high = mid - 1` assigns the value of `mid - 1` to the variable `high`. This changes the value of `high` from its previous value based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The precondition states that `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`, and `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.

Given this, after executing `high = mid - 1`, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true, which implies that `mid - 1 >= low`, leading to `low <= mid - 1`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, otherwise `result` is `mid`; `mid` is now calculated as `(low + (mid - 1)) // 2`; `low` remains unchanged; `high` is updated to `mid - 1;` `low` and `high` satisfy the condition `low <= high`.**
