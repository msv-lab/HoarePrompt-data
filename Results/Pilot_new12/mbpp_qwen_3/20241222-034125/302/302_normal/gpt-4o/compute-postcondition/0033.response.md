Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` in the list. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of the `target` in the list; otherwise, it returns -1. The function handles the case where the initial value of `high` is -1, indicating that the search range is invalid, by immediately returning -1 without further processing. This ensures that the function correctly indicates that the target is not found when the search range is invalid.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the `target` is not found in the list and the initial value of `high` is -1, the function returns -1, indicating that the search range is invalid.
- If the list `arr` is empty, the function will set `low` to 0 and `high` to -1, and then exit the loop without performing any search, correctly returning -1.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation suggests that the function returns -1 if the target is not found, but it does not specify what happens if the target is found. The code correctly updates `result` to the index of the `target` when found and then exits the loop, which is correct. However, the annotation could have been more explicit about the behavior when the target is found.
