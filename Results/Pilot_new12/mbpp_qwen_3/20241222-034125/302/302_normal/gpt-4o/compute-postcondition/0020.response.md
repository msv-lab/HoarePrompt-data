Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to ((low + high) // 2) + 1 and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `l + (l + h) // 2 - 1. In both cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
