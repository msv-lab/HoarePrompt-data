Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `result` is -1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `low <= high`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the values of `low` and `high` do not need to be adjusted directly to satisfy the condition `low <= high`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - Given the initial values of `low` and `high`, we need to ensure that the condition `low <= high` is met.
   - In the current state, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, so the condition `0 <= len(arr) - 1` is already true for any non-empty list `arr`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once because the initial values of `low` and `high` already satisfy the condition `low <= high`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**State**: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
