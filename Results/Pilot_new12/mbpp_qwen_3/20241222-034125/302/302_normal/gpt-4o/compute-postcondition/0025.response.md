The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be one less than the current value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`result` is `mid`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `high` is now `mid - 1` based on comparisons with `arr[mid]`, and `mid` is now calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
