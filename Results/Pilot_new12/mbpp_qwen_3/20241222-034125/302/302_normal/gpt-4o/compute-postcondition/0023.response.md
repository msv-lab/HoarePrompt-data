The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the middle index of the current search range and assigns it to `mid`. This does not change the values of `low` and `high`, nor does it affect `target` or `result`. It also does not return any value. Therefore, the only change is the updated value of `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`; if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains unchanged; if `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`; in all cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`; `mid` is now calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
