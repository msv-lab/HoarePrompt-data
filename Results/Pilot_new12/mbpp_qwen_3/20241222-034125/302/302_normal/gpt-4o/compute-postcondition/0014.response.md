Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - `low` and `high` are adjusted based on comparisons with `arr[mid]`.
   - `result` is `-1` if the target is not found.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1` and `low` remains `0`.
   - `result` remains `-1` if `arr[mid] != target`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop condition `low <= high` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Determining Next State:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `low <= high`, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high` after the adjustment.

### Current State After Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison with `arr[mid]`.
- `result` is `-1` if the target is not found.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop continues, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the possible adjustments:
- If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`. This can potentially violate the loop condition `low <= high`.
- If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1` and `low` remains `0`. This can also potentially violate the loop condition `low <= high`.

To ensure the loop continues, we need to guarantee that `low` remains less than or equal to `high` after any update. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `result` is -1 if the target is not found.**

In summary, the critical state to adjust is ensuring that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
