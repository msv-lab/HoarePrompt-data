The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, with the values `0` and `len(arr) - 1` respectively. This does not change the values of the existing variables `arr` and `target`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `low` and `high`, while keeping the initial values of `arr` and `target`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1**
