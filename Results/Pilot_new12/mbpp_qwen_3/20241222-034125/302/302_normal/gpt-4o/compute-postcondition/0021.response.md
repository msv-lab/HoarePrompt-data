Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `high` remains unchanged. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `low + (low + high) // 2 - 1`. In all cases, `result` is `-1` if the target is not found, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
