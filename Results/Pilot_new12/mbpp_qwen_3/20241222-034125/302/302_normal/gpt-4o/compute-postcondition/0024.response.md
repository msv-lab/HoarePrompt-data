The line `result = mid` assigns the current value of `mid` to `result`. The value of `mid` is determined by the previous conditions and calculations involving `low` and `high`. The other variables (`low`, `high`, `target`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Given the initial conditions:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` and `high` are adjusted based on comparisons with `arr[mid]`.
- `result` is set to `mid` if `arr[mid] == target`, otherwise, it is `-1` if the target is not found.

After executing `result = mid`, the updated state is:

- `result` is now equal to `mid`.
- `low` and `high` remain as per the previous conditions.
- `arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`result` is `mid`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are adjusted based on comparisons with `arr[mid]`, and `mid` is now calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.**
