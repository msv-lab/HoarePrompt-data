The code sets `high` to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, but this does not affect the assignment of `high`. Therefore, the only change is to the `high` variable.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `target` is an integer; `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `high` is now `mid - 1`; `result` is `mid`; `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`**
