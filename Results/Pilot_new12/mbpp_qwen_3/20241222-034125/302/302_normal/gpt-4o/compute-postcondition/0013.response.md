Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are adjusted based on whether `arr[mid]` is equal to, less than, or greater than `target`. If `arr[mid] == target`, `result` is set to `mid`. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1` and `low` remains `0`. `result` is still -1 if `arr[mid] != target`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2`.***
