Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(arr, num)` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`).

2. **Algorithm**: The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` at each position. It checks if the current element `x` matches the target number `num`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the target number `num` is not found in the array, the function continues iterating until the end of the array and then returns `-1`.
   - Since the array is sorted, the function ensures that the first occurrence of the target number is found and returned. If the number is not present, the function correctly returns `-1`.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `-1` when the target number is not found, which is consistent with the requirement to indicate that the number is not in the array.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the specified functionality for finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, and it handles all relevant edge cases as described in the problem statement.
