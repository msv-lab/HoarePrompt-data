Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, once the number is found, it will be returned immediately, which is the correct behavior. The function iterates through the array and returns the index as soon as it finds a match, or returns `-1` if the number is not found. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for every potential case within the constraints of a linear search, making the program correct according to the problem description.
