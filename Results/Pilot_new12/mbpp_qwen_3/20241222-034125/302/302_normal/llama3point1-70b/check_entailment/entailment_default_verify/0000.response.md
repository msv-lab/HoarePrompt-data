Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index for the first occurrence of the number or `-1` if the number is not found. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function handles all potential cases within the constraints of a linear search, the program is correct according to the problem description.
