Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through the given sorted array `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If it finds an element equal to `num`, it returns the index immediately. If it reaches the end of the array without finding `num`, it returns `-1`. This approach correctly handles all potential cases:

1. If `num` is present in the array, it will return the correct index.
2. If `num` is not present in the array, it will return `-1`.

Since the function works as expected for all cases, the program is correct.
