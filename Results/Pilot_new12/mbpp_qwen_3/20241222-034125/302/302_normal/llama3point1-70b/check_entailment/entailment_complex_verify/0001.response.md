Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations support this by indicating that the function will return the correct index if the number is found and `-1` if it is not found. The function works as expected for all cases mentioned in the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
