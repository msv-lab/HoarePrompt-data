Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations provide a clear description of the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Specifically, the function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checks if the current element matches the target number, and returns the index immediately upon finding a match. If no match is found, the function returns `-1`. Given that the array is sorted and the function returns the index as soon as it finds a match, the function correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
