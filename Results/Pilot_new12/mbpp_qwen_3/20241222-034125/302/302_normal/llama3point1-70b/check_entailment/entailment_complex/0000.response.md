Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The program iterates through each element of the array using a for loop. During each iteration, it checks if the current element `x` matches `num`.
3. **Early Return**: As soon as a match is found, the function immediately returns the index `i` of the matching element. This ensures that the first occurrence is returned.
4. **No Match Case**: If no match is found during the loop, the function returns `-1` after the loop completes. This handles the case where `num` is not present in the array.
5. **Input Validity Assumption**: Although not explicitly handled within the function, the problem description assumes valid inputs (a sorted list and an integer). The function does not include error handling for invalid inputs like non-lists or non-integer values, but this aligns with the given assumption in the problem description.

Since the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly handles both the presence and absence of the target number in the array, the program is correct.
