Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotated version provides a clear description of the states of the program at different points, which aligns with the behavior of the function. Specifically, the function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, and upon finding the first occurrence of the target number `num`, it immediately returns the index `i`. If the number is not found, the function returns `-1`. This behavior matches the problem description of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
