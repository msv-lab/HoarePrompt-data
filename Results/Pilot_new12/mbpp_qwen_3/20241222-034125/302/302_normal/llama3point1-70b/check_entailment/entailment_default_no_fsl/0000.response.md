Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. When it finds the first occurrence of the given number `num`, it immediately returns the index. If the loop completes without finding the number, it returns `-1`. This implementation correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement and output hints. It correctly returns `0` if the number is found at the first position, `1` if found at the second position, and so on. If the number is not present in the array, it correctly returns `-1`. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
