Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints correctly describe the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` or `-1` if `num` is not found. Since the function works as expected for all described cases and the problem description matches the functionality, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
