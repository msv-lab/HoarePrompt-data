Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations support this by detailing the state of the program at various points. Specifically, the for loop iterates through the array, and if it finds the target number `num`, it returns the current index `i`. If it completes the loop without finding `num`, it returns `-1`, which correctly indicates that `num` is not in the array. The annotations clarify that `i` will either be the index of `num` if it is found or the length of the array if it is not, which aligns with the expected behavior. Thus, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
