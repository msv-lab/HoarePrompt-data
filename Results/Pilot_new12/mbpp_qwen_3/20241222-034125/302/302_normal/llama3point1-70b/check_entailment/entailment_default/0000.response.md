Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a linear search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value at each step. If the current value matches the target number, it immediately returns the index. If no match is found, it returns -1. This approach works correctly for finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the function meets the requirements for every potential case:

- It correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the target number.
- If the target number is not present in the array, it correctly returns -1.
- The function handles the case where the target number is at the beginning of the array, middle of the array, or end of the array.

Since the code performs the required task accurately and handles all potential cases as described, the correctness is **True**.
