According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over, meaning `i` must be less than the length of `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `num` is an integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Since `x` is the first element in `arr` and it is not equal to `num`, the next element `x` in the list should still be different from `num`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than the length of `arr`.

Thus, `i` becomes 1, and `x` is now the second element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
