Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, and either `i` is the index where `num` is found in `arr` (if `num` is in `arr`), or `i` is the length of `arr` (if `num` is not in `arr`).**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution and Variable Changes:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`i`) and the value (`x`) of each element.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `x` is equal to `num`.
   - If `x` is equal to `num`, the function returns the current index `i` and stops further execution.
   - If `x` is not equal to `num`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

2. **Final States:**
   - If `num` is found in `arr`, the loop will eventually find the first occurrence of `num` and return its index `i`.
   - If `num` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete all iterations without finding a match, and `i` will be set to the length of `arr` because the loop will increment `i` until it reaches the end of the list.

3. **State After Loop Completion:**
   - If `num` is found, `i` will be the index of `num` in `arr`.
   - If `num` is not found, `i` will be the length of `arr`, indicating that `num` is not present in the list.

Thus, the final state captures whether `num` was found in `arr` and if so, at which index, or if it was not found, setting `i` to the length of `arr`.
