According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 to 2, and `x` must be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in `arr`.**
