According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the variable `i`. The loop will start if `arr` is not empty. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, we don't need to adjust this part. However, we need to ensure that the initial state includes the starting condition for the loop.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, as `enumerate` starts indexing from 0. Also, `x` will be the first element in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
