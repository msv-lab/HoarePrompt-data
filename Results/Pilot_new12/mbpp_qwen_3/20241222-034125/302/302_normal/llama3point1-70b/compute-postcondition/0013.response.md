Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`. If `num` is found at the beginning of the list (`i=0`), it returns 0. If `num` is found at the second position (`i=1`), it returns 1. If `num` is found at the third position (`i=2`), it returns 2. If `num` is not found in `arr`, it returns -1.**

This covers all potential cases based on the actual code and annotations. The function checks each element in the list and returns the index relative to the starting point (0-based indexing). If the number is not found, it returns -1, indicating that the number is not present in the list.
