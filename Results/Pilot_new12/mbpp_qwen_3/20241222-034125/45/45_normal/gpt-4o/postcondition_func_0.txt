The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`. It converts `n` to its string representation `s`. The function checks several conditions:
1. If the length of `s` is less than 3, it immediately returns `False`.
2. If the first digit of `n` is equal to the second digit of `n`, it also returns `False`.
3. For the remaining digits, it verifies that all even-indexed digits (starting from the third digit) are equal to the first digit, and all odd-indexed digits (starting from the fourth digit) are equal to the second digit.
4. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

The function returns `False` for all positive integers `n` except for `n = 9`, where it returns `True`. This means the function effectively checks if `n` is 9 by ensuring its string representation meets specific criteria.
