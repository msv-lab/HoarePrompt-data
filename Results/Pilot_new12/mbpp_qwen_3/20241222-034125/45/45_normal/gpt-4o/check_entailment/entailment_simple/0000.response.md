Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number that alternates between two digits and has at least three digits. The program follows these steps:

1. Convert the number to its string representation.
2. Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If so, return `False` immediately because an undulating number must have at least three digits.
3. Ensure that the first and second digits are different. If they are the same, return `False` because an undulating number cannot start with two identical digits.
4. Iterate through the string starting from the third character and verify that:
   - Even-indexed characters (starting from index 2) match the first digit.
   - Odd-indexed characters (starting from index 3) match the second digit.
5. If the above conditions are satisfied for all characters, return `True`.

The test cases provided also validate that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` because it alternates between 1 and 2.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False` because it does not alternate consistently.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True` because it alternates between 1 and 2 and has exactly three digits.

Since the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary conditions, it is correct.
