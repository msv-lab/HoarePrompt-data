Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if a number is undulating based on the criteria that the first two digits must be different, and the sequence alternates between these two digits for the rest of the number. However, the code has a logical flaw in handling numbers where the last digit matches the first digit, which violates the undulating pattern definition. 

For example, consider the number `12121211`. According to the problem description, this number should be considered undulating because it alternates between '1' and '2'. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `False` because the last digit '1' matches the first digit '1', violating the condition that no two consecutive digits should be the same.

To fix this, the loop should continue until the second-to-last digit to avoid checking the last digit against the first digit:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s) - 1):  # Change here
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

With this modification, the function should correctly identify undulating numbers according to the problem description.
