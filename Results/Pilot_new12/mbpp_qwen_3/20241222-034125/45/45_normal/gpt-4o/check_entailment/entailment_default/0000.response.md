Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that has the form ABABAB... where A and B are different digits. The current implementation fails to correctly identify such numbers.

For instance, consider the number `121212`. According to the definition, this should be an undulating number because it follows the pattern `121212`. However, the current code will return `False` for `121212` because it incorrectly checks that the first and second digits are not equal (`1 != 2`), and then proceeds to check the rest of the digits without correctly identifying the undulating pattern.

To fix this, the code should ensure that the first two digits are different and then check that all subsequent pairs of digits alternate between the first and second digit. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s) - 1):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    # Check the last pair of digits
    if len(s) % 2 == 1 and s[-1] != first_digit:
        return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly identifies undulating numbers.
