Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether the given number is undulating or not based on the provided problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the length of the string representation of `n` is less than 3. If so, it returns `False`. This handles cases where the number cannot possibly be undulating (e.g., 1, 12, 123).

2. **First Two Digits Check**: The function then checks if the first digit is equal to the second digit. If they are equal, it returns `False`. This ensures that there is a change between the first two digits, which is necessary for a number to be considered undulating.

3. **Pattern Verification**: The function uses a for loop to verify the pattern for the rest of the digits. It checks that all even-indexed digits (starting from the third digit) are equal to the first digit, and all odd-indexed digits (starting from the fourth digit) are equal to the second digit. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns `False`.

4. **Return True**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

The function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer because the problem description assumes valid inputs. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid cases, the correctness is **True**.
