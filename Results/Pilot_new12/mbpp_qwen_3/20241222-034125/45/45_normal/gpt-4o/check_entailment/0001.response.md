Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits, such as 1212121 or 353535. The function converts the number to a string and then checks if the length is less than 3, which would make it impossible to have an alternating pattern. It then checks the first two digits and ensures they are different. Finally, it iterates through the rest of the digits, ensuring that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit.

The provided test cases cover some basic scenarios:
- `1212121` is correctly identified as an undulating number.
- `1991` is correctly identified as not being an undulating number.
- `121` is correctly identified as an undulating number.

Given the logic and the provided test cases, the function appears to handle the problem correctly for the specified criteria. No counterexamples were found that would make the function return an incorrect result based on the definition of an undulating number.
