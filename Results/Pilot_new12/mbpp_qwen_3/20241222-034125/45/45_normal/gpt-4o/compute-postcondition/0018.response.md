Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 3, and `i` is less than `len(s)`. The index `i` is odd, and the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the second digit of `n` as a string. If `i % 2 == 0` and `s[i] != first_digit`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (since there is no explicit return statement provided in the else part).***
