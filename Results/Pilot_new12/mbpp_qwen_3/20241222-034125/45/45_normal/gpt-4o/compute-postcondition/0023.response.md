Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4, and `i` is less than `len(s)`. If `i % 2 == 0` and `s[i] != first_digit`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (None).***
