Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` with a length greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2 and is less than the length of `s`, and the current value of `i` satisfies `i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit`***
