Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify all undulating numbers. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of two digits, such as 121212 or 353535. However, the current implementation only checks up to `len(n) - 1` and does not ensure that the entire string follows the undulating pattern.

For example, consider the number `12121`. The program will not correctly identify this as an undulating number because it only checks until the second last character and does not verify the final pair of digits.

To fix this, the loop should iterate until `len(n) - 2` and an additional check should be added to verify the last two characters:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3 or len(set(n)) != 2:
        return False
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] == n[i] or n[i] == n[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the entire string follows the undulating pattern and handles edge cases properly.
