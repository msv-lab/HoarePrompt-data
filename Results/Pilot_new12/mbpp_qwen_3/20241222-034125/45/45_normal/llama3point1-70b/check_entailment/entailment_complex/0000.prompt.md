You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, and `undulating` is `True` if for every index `i` (1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1), the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.
    return undulating
    #`The program returns the boolean value 'undulating', which is True if the string 'n' meets the undulating condition, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input, converts it to a string, and checks whether the string representation of `n` is undulating. A number is considered undulating if it alternates between increasing and decreasing between consecutive digits. Specifically, for every index `i` (1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1), either `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` must hold true. The function returns `True` if the string representation of `n` meets the undulating condition, otherwise it returns `False`. Edge cases include single-digit numbers (which are not undulating) and strings where the alternating pattern is broken at any point, resulting in `False`. The function correctly handles these cases and does not have any missing functionality.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
