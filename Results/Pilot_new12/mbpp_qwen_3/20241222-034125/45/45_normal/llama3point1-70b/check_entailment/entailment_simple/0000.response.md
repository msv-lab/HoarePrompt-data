Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly implements the logic required to check if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that alternates between increasing and decreasing digits. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a string `n = str(n)`. This ensures that the program works with a sequence of characters representing the digits of the number.

2. **Condition Checking**: The for loop iterates over the string representation of `n` from the second character to the second-to-last character (`range(1, len(n) - 1)`). For each character at index `i`, it checks if the digit at `i` is either greater than the previous digit and less than the next digit, or less than the previous digit and greater than the next digit. If this condition holds for all such indices, the variable `undulating` remains `True`.

3. **Early Termination**: If the condition fails for any index `i`, the program sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the function immediately returns `False` if any part of the number does not meet the undulating condition.

4. **Output**: After the loop, the function returns the value of `undulating`. This value is `True` if the number is undulating and `False` otherwise.

Given these points, the program accurately checks whether a given number is undulating as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
