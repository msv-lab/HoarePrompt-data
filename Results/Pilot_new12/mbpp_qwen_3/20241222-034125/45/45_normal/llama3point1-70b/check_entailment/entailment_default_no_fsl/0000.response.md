Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the edge case where the number has fewer than three digits. An undulating number must have at least three digits to alternate between increasing and decreasing. For example, the number `12` should not be considered undulating, but the current implementation does not account for this. To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to return `False` if the length of the number is less than 3. Here is an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

With this addition, the function will correctly identify that numbers with fewer than three digits are not undulating.
