Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is undulating based on the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input. It correctly converts this integer to a string, which allows it to easily access individual digits and compare them.

2. **Logic for Undulating Check**:
   - The function iterates through the string representation of `n`, checking each digit against its neighbors.
   - For each index `i` (where `1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1`), it verifies whether the digit at `i` is greater than both its neighbors (`n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]`) or less than both its neighbors (`n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]`). This ensures that the number alternates between increasing and decreasing.
   - If the condition is met for all such indices, the variable `undulating` remains `True`. If any index fails the condition, `undulating` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks immediately.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-digit numbers are correctly identified as not being undulating, since they cannot alternate.
   - Numbers where the alternating pattern is broken at any point also correctly result in `False`.

4. **Output**: The function returns the boolean value `undulating`, which is `True` if the number is undulating and `False` otherwise.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and correctly identifies whether a given number is undulating or not. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
