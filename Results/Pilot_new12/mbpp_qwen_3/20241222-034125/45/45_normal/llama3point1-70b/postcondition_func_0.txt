The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input, converts it to a string, and checks whether the string representation of `n` is undulating. A number is considered undulating if it alternates between increasing and decreasing between consecutive digits. Specifically, for every index `i` (1 â‰¤ i < len(n) - 1), either `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` must hold true. The function returns `True` if the string representation of `n` meets the undulating condition, otherwise it returns `False`. Edge cases include single-digit numbers (which are not undulating) and strings where the alternating pattern is broken at any point, resulting in `False`. The function correctly handles these cases and does not have any missing functionality.
