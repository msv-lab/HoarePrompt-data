The variable `undulating` is set to `False`. The initial state values of `n` and its properties are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, undulating is False, and there exists at least one index i such that (n[i - 1] >= n[i] or n[i] >= n[i + 1]).**
