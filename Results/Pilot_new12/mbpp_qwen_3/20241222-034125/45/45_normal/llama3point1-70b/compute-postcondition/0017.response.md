The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes an exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, and the variable `i` is set to `len(n) - 2`; `undulating` is False.**
