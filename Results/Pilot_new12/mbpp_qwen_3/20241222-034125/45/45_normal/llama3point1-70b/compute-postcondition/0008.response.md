Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character. If there exists at least one index `i` such that either (`n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]`) or (`n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]`), then the string `n` is considered undulating as True. Otherwise, `n` is considered undulating as False.***
