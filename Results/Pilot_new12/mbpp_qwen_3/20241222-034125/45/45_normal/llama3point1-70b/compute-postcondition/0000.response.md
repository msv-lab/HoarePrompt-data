The code snippet changes the value of `n` from an integer to a string by converting it using the `str` function. Since `n` was initially a positive integer, after the code is executed, `n` will be a string representation of that positive integer. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the original positive integer**
