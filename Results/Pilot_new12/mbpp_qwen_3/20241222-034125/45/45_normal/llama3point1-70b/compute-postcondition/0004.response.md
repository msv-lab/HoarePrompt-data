The `pass` statement in Python does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not affect any variables or change the state of the program in any way. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that must have more than one character, undulating is True, and there exists at least one index `i` where either (`n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]`) or (`n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]`).**
