Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, and the variable `i` is set to `len(n) - 1`. If the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` is met, the function does not change the state of `undulating`. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to `False`.**
