The code assigns `False` to the variable `undulating`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, and the variable `i` is set to `len(n) - 2`; `undulating` is False.**
