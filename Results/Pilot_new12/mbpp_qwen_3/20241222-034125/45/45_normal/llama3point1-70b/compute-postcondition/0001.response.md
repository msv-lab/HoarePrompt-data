The code assigns `True` to the variable `undulating`. This assignment does not affect the value of `n`, which remains as a string representation of the original positive integer. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `undulating` variable with the value `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the original positive integer; `undulating` is True**
