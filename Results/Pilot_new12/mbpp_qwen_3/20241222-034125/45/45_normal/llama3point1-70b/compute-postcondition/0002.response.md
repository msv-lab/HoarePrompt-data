According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `len(n) - 1`, which means `n` must be a string with more than one character (i.e., its length must be greater than 1). 

Given the initial state where `n` is a string representation of a positive integer and `undulating` is `True`, we need to ensure that the string `n` has more than one character for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that must have more than one character, undulating is True**
