    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with more than one character, and `undulating` is `True` if for every index `i` (1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1), the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.
    return undulating
    #`The program returns the boolean value 'undulating', which is True if the string 'n' meets the undulating condition, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input, converts it to a string, and checks whether the string representation of `n` is undulating. A number is considered undulating if it alternates between increasing and decreasing between consecutive digits. Specifically, for every index `i` (1 ≤ i < len(n) - 1), either `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` must hold true. The function returns `True` if the string representation of `n` meets the undulating condition, otherwise it returns `False`. Edge cases include single-digit numbers (which are not undulating) and strings where the alternating pattern is broken at any point, resulting in `False`. The function correctly handles these cases and does not have any missing functionality.
