Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` containing strings and returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the tuple. The function processes each string in the tuple and extracts its last character using list comprehension. This process handles all strings in the tuple, including those with a single character or empty strings. If a string is empty, the last character will be an empty string. The function does not modify the original tuple; instead, it creates and returns a new list based on the input tuple.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If any string in the tuple is empty, the returned list will contain an empty string for that position.
- If the tuple itself is empty, the function returns an empty list.
