#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing strings.
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
    #The program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` containing strings and returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the tuple. The function processes each string in the tuple and extracts its last character using list comprehension. This process handles all strings in the tuple, including those with a single character or empty strings. If a string is empty, the last character will be an empty string. The function does not modify the original tuple; instead, it creates and returns a new list based on the input tuple.
