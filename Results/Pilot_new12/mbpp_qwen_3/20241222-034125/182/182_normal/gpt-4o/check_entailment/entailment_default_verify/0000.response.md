Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) from each string in the given tuple. The provided output hints confirm that the function processes each string in the tuple and creates a new list with the last characters of each string. The function does not modify the original tuple, and it handles cases where strings might be empty, returning an empty string for such cases. The assertions in the code snippet also validate this behavior. Given the problem description and the output hints, the program meets the requirements.
