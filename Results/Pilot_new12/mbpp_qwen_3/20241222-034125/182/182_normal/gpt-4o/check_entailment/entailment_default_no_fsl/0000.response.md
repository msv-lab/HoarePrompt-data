Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear index (last) element of each string in the given tuple. The code uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`. The examples provided in the output hints and the assertions in the code cover various cases, including strings of different lengths and even single-character strings. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation fails to handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
