Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version supports this by explicitly stating that the function processes each string in the tuple and returns a new list with the last character of each string. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
