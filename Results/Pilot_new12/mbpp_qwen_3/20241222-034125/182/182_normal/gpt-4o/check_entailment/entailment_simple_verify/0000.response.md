Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple, as evidenced by the provided assertions and the annotated code. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and return a list of the last characters. The annotations clarify that the input `tup` is a tuple containing strings, and the function returns a list of characters. Since the provided examples and the logic of the function match the problem description, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
