Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates through each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character. The assertions provided in the code snippet also validate this behavior. Given the examples and the logic of the function, there do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described.
