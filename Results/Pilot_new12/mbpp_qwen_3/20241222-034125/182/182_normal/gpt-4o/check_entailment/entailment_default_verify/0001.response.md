Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The output hints confirm that the function processes each string in the tuple and returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string. This includes handling single-character strings and empty strings appropriately, as indicated by the output hints. Therefore, there is no evidence suggesting that the program does not meet the problem description.
