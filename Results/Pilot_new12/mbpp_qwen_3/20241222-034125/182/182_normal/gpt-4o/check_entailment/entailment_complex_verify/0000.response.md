Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the annotated version, and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index (last) element of each string in the given tuple. The provided examples and the logic of the function, as well as the annotations, confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and retrieve the last character, which aligns with the problem description. The original assessment is accurate, and no issues are identified that would cause the function to fail under the given constraints.
