Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. All provided test cases and the general logic of the function confirm that it works as expected for the described problem. Since no counterexample has been found where the function fails, the code is correct.
