Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character of each string. The function handles all potential cases, including strings with a single character, multiple characters, or even empty strings. The output matches the provided assertions, and the function works as expected for every potential case within the given problem description.
