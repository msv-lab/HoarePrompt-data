Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. All provided test cases and the general logic of the function confirm that it works as expected for the described problem. Since no counterexample has been found where the function fails, and the annotated version supports the correctness, the original assessment is maintained.
