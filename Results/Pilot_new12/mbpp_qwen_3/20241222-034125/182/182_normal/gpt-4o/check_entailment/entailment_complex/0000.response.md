Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The list comprehension used in the function iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts its last character using the index `s[-1]`, which correctly accesses the last character of each string. 

The function does not modify the original tuple and instead constructs and returns a new list. It handles all cases, including strings with a single character or empty strings, as required. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
