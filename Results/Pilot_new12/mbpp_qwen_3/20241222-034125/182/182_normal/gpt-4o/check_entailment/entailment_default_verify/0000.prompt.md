You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates through each string in the tuple and retrieves the last character. The assertions provided in the code snippet also validate this behavior. Given the examples and the logic of the function, there do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` containing strings and returns a list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in the tuple. The function processes each string in the tuple and extracts its last character using list comprehension. This process handles all strings in the tuple, including those with a single character or empty strings. If a string is empty, the last character will be an empty string. The function does not modify the original tuple; instead, it creates and returns a new list based on the input tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
