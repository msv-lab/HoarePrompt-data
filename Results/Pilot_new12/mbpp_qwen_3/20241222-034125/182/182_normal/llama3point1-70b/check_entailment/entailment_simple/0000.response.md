Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This exactly matches the requirement to "extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple." The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the input tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`. Therefore, the program correctly implements the described functionality for any valid input tuple of strings.
