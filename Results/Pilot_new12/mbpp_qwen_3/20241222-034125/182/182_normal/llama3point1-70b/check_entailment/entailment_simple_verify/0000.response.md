Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple, as indicated by the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`. The annotated version further confirms this by stating that the program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple 'strings'. There are no issues with the input handling as per the problem description, and the function works as expected for valid inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
