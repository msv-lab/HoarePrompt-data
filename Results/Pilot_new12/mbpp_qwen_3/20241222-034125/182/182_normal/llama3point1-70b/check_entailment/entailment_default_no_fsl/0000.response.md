Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear (last) index element from each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates through each string in the tuple and appends the last character of each string to the resulting list. The code handles the case where a string in the tuple is empty, as it correctly places an empty string in the output list for such cases. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and it seems to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
