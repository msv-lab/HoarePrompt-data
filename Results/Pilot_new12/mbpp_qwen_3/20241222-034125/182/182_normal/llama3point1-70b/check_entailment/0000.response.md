Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple. This is evident from the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`, which iterates over each string in the tuple and returns its last character. Since the function behaves as expected for any tuple of strings, there are no cases found where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.
