Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling tuples of strings and returning a list of their respective last characters. Even though the output hints mention handling empty strings by returning an empty string, this is still within the expected behavior and does not invalidate the correctness of the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
