Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This directly matches the requirement specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program handles the case where a string in the tuple is empty by returning an empty string for that position in the output list, which is consistent with the description. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the program performs as expected for all valid inputs under the given assumptions.
