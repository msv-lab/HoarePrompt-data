Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the tuple `strings` and appends the last character of each string to the resulting list. The code handles all potential cases, including empty strings within the tuple, as the last character of an empty string is also an empty string. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and it accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.
