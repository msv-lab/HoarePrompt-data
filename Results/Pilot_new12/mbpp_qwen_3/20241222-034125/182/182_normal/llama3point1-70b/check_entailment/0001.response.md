Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. This is achieved using list comprehension with `s[-1]`, which accesses the last character of each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases (i.e., any tuple containing strings), there is no scenario where this function would fail based on the problem description.
