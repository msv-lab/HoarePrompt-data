Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function operates on a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string. There is no scenario where this function would fail based on the problem description, assuming valid input as stated. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
