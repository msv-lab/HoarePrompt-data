Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple, as described in the problem statement. The annotated version further confirms this by stating that the function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
