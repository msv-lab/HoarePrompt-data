The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists. It returns a new list that contains all elements from `list1` except the last one, followed by all elements from `list2`. This operation is performed by slicing `list1` to exclude its last element and then concatenating the resulting list with `list2`. Potential edge cases include when either `list1` or `list2` is empty; in such cases, the returned list will either be an empty list (if both are empty) or will consist only of elements from `list2` (if `list1` is empty). There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
