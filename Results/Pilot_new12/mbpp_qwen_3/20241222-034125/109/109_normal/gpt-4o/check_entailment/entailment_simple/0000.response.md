Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input (`list1` and `list2`) and replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. This is achieved by using list slicing to exclude the last element of `list1` and then concatenating it with `list2`.

Let's break down the solution:

- The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.
- It uses the slice notation `list1[:-1]` to get a new list that contains all elements of `list1` except the last one.
- It then concatenates this sliced list with `list2` using the `+` operator.
- The resulting list is returned.

The provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly:
1. `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` (excluding the last element) concatenated with `[2, 4, 6, 8]` results in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
2. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (excluding the last element) concatenated with `[5, 6, 7, 8]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
3. `['red', 'blue', 'green']` (excluding the last element) concatenated with `['yellow']` results in `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
