Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list. The function concatenates the first list up to the second-to-last element with the second list, which satisfies the problem description. All the provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential scenario where the function would fail based on the given problem description and examples.
