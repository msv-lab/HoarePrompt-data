Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list. The function works as expected in the given assertions:

1. `assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
2. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
3. `assert func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow']) == ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`

The function uses slicing to remove the last element of `list1` and concatenates it with `list2`, which satisfies the requirement of replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. Since no edge cases or additional potential cases have been identified where the function fails to meet the problem description, the program is considered correct.
