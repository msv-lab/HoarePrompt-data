Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input and returns a new list that contains all elements from `list1` except the last one, followed by all elements from `list2`. This is achieved by using the slicing operation `list1[:-1]` to exclude the last element of `list1` and then concatenating it with `list2` using the `+` operator. 

The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
1. Both lists contain multiple elements.
2. Both lists contain multiple elements, but the second list has more elements than the first.
3. The second list contains only one element.

In each case, the function correctly produces the expected output as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
