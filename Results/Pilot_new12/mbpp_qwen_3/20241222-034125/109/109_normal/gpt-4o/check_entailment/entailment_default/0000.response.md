Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The function uses list slicing and concatenation to achieve this. The examples provided demonstrate the function working correctly for different scenarios:

1. Replacing the last element of a list with multiple elements from another list.
2. Handling cases where the second list has fewer elements than the first list.
3. Dealing with lists containing different types of elements (e.g., integers and strings).

Given the problem description and the examples, the function behaves as expected for every potential case within the constraints of the problem.
