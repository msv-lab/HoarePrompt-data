Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list as described. The annotated version confirms that the function slices the first list to exclude its last element and then concatenates it with the second list. This behavior matches the problem description and the provided assertions pass without failure. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
