Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). Here are a few test cases to validate this:

1. **Case 1**: Both lists have elements.
   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list2 = [4, 5]
   result = func_1(list1, list2)
   # Expected output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
   ```

2. **Case 2**: The first list has only one element.
   ```python
   list1 = [1]
   list2 = [2, 3]
   result = func_1(list1, list2)
   # Expected output: [2, 3]
   ```

3. **Case 3**: The first list is empty.
   ```python
   list1 = []
   list2 = [1, 2]
   result = func_1(list1, list2)
   # Expected output: [1, 2]
   ```

4. **Case 4**: The second list is empty.
   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list2 = []
   result = func_1(list1, list2)
   # Expected output: [1, 2]
   ```

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
