Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it replaces `list1` entirely with `list2`. The code handles both cases as specified:

1. If `list1` is not empty, the line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.
2. If `list1` is empty, the line `list1 = list2` replaces `list1` with `list2`.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in both scenarios. There are no potential cases where the code fails to meet the requirements based on the provided information. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
