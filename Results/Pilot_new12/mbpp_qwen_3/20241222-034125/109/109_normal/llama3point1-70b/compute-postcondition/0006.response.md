The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists.

- If `list1` is empty, then `list1` references the same list object as `list2`.
- Otherwise, the last element of `list1` is replaced by all elements of `list2`, and `list1` contains those elements, while `list2` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two list parameters `list1` and `list2`, and either make `list1` reference the same list object as `list2` if `list1` is empty, or replace the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2` and ensure `list2` remains unchanged.
