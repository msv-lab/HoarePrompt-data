In this code snippet, `list1` is reassigned to be `list2`. This means that `list1` now references the same list object as `list2`. The initial state of `list1` being an empty list is lost because `list1` now points to whatever `list2` points to.

Output State: **`list1` references the same list object as `list2`, and `list2` retains its original state (which could be any list); initially, `list1` was an empty list.**
