Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It modifies `list1` based on whether it is empty or not. If `list1` is empty, it replaces `list1` with `list2`, making them reference the same list object. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces only the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`, while ensuring `list2` remains unchanged. This means that after the function execution, `list1` will either reference the same list as `list2` if `list1` was initially empty, or the last element of `list1` will be updated to the contents of `list2`, and `list2` will remain unaltered.**

This summary covers all the potential cases mentioned in the annotations and ensures that the actual code behavior is accurately reflected in the description.
