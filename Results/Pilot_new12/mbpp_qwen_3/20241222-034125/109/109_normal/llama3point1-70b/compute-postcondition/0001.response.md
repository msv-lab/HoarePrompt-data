The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. Since `list1` is not empty in the initial state, it has at least one element. However, the exact content of `list1` and `list2` is not specified.

After executing the code, the last element of `list1` will be replaced by `list2`. If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` will be removed. If `list2` is not empty, the last element of `list1` will be replaced by all elements of `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` has its last element replaced by all elements of `list2`; `list2` remains unchanged**
