According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop iterates backward through the list `arr`, starting from the last element and ending just before the first element. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Additionally, the initial value of `i` must be the length of `arr` minus 1.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Check if `arr` contains at least one element**: Since the loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and goes backwards, `arr` must have at least one element to start the loop.
2. **Initial value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` must be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

Given these points, we can formulate the required states as follows:

- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer (though its specific value is not relevant to determining if the loop can execute).
- `i` must be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and `i` must be set to `len(arr) - 1`**
