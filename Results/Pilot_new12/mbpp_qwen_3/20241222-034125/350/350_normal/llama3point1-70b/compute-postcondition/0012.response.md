The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. 

- In Case_1, the function returns the index of the last element in the list `arr` that is equal to `target`.
- In Case_2, the function returns `len(arr) - 2`.
- In Case_3, the function returns `len(arr) - 3`.
- In Case_4, the function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return specific indices based on the occurrences and positions of `target` in `arr` or -1 if certain conditions are met.
