Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the last occurrence of `target`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If `target` is not found, it returns `-1`. The possible return values are:
- `len(arr) - 1`: If `target` is the last element in the list.
- `-1`: If `target` is not found in the list.

There are no other specific indices like `len(arr) - 2` or `len(arr) - 3` mentioned in the code or annotations, and these should be considered as incorrect or redundant information. The function only returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` or `-1` if `target` is not found.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `arr` is empty, the function will still iterate through the list (though it won't find any elements), and return `-1`. This case is not explicitly handled in the code, but it is a valid edge case.**

This summary ensures that all actual functionality and potential edge cases are covered based on the provided code.
