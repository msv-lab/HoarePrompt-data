Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The first element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decreases until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current Value**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is currently `len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should now be `len(arr) - 2`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`arr` and `target`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.

6. **Updated State**: The new state before the next iteration of the loop should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**.
