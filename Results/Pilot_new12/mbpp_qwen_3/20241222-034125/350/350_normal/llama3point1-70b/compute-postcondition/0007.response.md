To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- The list `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Initially, `i` is set to `len(arr) - 2`.
- The loop iterates over `arr` in reverse, from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop starts at `len(arr) - 1` and goes down to `0`, decrementing by 1 each time.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value.
- Therefore, `i` will become `len(arr) - 3`.

### Conditions:
- The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`, which is still within the valid range of the loop (since `len(arr) - 1` is the highest index).

### Adjusted State:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `len(arr) - 3`.
- There are no other variables or conditions specified that would change during this iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**.
