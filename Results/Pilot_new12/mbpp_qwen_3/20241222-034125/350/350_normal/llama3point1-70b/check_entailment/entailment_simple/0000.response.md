Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the last position of a given element in a sorted array.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning using a `for` loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This ensures that the last occurrence of the target element (if it exists) will be encountered first.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) matches the target. If it does, it immediately returns the index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the target is not found in the array by returning `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where the target is found at multiple positions, as it stops at the first occurrence found during the reverse iteration.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
