Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly iterates over the sorted array in reverse order to find the last occurrence of the `target` element. The function returns the index of the last occurrence if found, and `-1` if the `target` is not present in the array. The annotations align with the problem description and the implementation of the function. There is no evidence from the annotations suggesting any issues with the program's behavior or logic. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
