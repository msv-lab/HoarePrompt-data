Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last element, and returns the index as soon as it finds a match for the target value. If no match is found, it returns -1. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through the array in reverse and returning the correct index or -1 if the target is not found. There is no evidence from the annotations or the original assessment that suggests the program does not meet the problem description.
