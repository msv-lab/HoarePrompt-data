Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element. If the target element is not found, it returns -1. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
