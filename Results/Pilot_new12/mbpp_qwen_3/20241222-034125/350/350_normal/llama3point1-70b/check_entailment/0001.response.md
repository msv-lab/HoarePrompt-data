Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates over the given sorted array `arr` in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element. If the `target` is not found in the array, it returns `-1`. This approach correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Since the array is sorted, the first (and only) occurrence of the target element when found from the end will be the last occurrence in the entire array. Therefore, this implementation is correct and meets the requirements for all possible inputs.
