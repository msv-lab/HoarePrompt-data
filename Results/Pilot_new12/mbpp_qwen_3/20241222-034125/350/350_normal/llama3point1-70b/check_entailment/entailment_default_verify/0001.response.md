Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list in reverse order, ensuring that the first (and only) occurrence of the target element from the end is returned, which is the last occurrence in the array. The possible return values, `len(arr) - 1` and `-1`, align with the problem description and the behavior of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
