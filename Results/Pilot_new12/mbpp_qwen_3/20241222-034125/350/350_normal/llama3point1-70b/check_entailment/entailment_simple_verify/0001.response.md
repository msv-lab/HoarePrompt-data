Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of the `target` in a sorted array by iterating in reverse order. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program, indicating that `i` will be the index of the last occurrence of `target` if found, and `-1` will be returned if `target` is not present in `arr`. The function handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations confirm that the logic is sound. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
