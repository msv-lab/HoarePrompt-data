Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the last position of a given element (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`).
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The function iterates through the array in reverse order using a `for` loop starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to the first index (`0`).
   - If the current element matches the `target`, the function immediately returns the current index, which is the last occurrence of the `target`.
   - If the loop completes without finding the `target`, the function returns `-1`.

Given these points, the function correctly adheres to the problem description by iterating through the array in reverse to ensure the last occurrence is found. The return values `-1` (when the target is not found) and the index of the last occurrence (when the target is found) align with the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
