Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, returning the index as soon as it finds a match for the target value. If no match is found, it returns -1. This approach ensures that the last occurrence of the target is found, which satisfies the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs where this program would fail based on the given problem statement.
