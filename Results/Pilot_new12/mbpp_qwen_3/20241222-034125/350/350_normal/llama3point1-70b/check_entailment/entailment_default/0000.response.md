Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the array in reverse order to find the last occurrence of the target element. If the target is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints. There are no specific indices mentioned in the hints that are not covered by the code, and the logic is sound for finding the last position of the target element in a sorted array.
