Functionality: **This function searches for the last occurrence of the integer `x` in the sorted list `arr`. If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`. The function iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, checking each element against `x`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the current index. If no match is found after iterating through the entire list, the function returns `-1`. Potential edge cases include when `arr` is empty or contains only one element.**

**Specifically:**
- If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`.
- If `x` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`.
- If `arr` is empty, the function will return `-1` since `x` cannot be found in an empty list.
- If `arr` contains only one element, the function will return `-1` if that element is not equal to `x`, or the index `0` if it is equal to `x`.
