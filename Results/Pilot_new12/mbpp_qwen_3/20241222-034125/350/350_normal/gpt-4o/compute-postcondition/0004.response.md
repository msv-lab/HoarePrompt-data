Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is -1.
   - This means the loop will iterate over the elements of `arr` from the last element to the first element.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`.
   - The condition that the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x` remains unchanged unless the loop modifies this condition, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it does not change this condition.

5. **Final State:**
   - `arr` remains the same (a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order).
   - `x` remains the same (an integer).
   - `i` is now `len(arr) - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**.
