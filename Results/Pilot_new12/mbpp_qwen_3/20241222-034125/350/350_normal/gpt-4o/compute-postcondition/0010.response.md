Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, and `i` is -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `i` is the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `arr` from the last element to the first.
- If the current element matches `x`, the function returns the current index.
- If no match is found after the loop completes, the function returns `-1`.

Since the loop continues until it either finds `x` or exhausts all elements in the list, the final value of `i` will be the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`, or `-1` if `x` is not present in `arr`.
