According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`.

Since `arr` and `x` remain the same, and the condition for the loop to continue is simply that `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `len(arr) - 3` and that it is still within the valid range.

State: **`arr` remains the same (a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order), `x` remains the same (an integer), and `i` is now `len(arr) - 3`.**
