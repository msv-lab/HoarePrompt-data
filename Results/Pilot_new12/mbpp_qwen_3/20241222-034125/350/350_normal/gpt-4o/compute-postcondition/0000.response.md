Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State**: The state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `x` is an integer.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`, decrementing by `-1` each time.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is within the bounds of the list `arr`.
   - Specifically, `i` must satisfy `0 <= i < len(arr)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The key variable here is `i`, which starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`.
   - Since the loop is inclusive of `0`, `i` should start from `len(arr) - 1` and go down to `0`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted such that `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
