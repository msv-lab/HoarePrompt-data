Postcondition: ***`arr` remains the same (a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order), `x` remains the same (an integer), and `i` is now `len(arr) - 3`. If `arr[i] == x`, the function returns `len(arr) - 3`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and the variables remain unchanged.***
