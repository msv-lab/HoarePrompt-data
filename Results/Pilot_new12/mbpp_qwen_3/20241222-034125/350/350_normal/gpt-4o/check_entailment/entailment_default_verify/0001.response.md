Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, ensuring that it returns the last occurrence of the target element. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function searches for the last occurrence of the integer `x` in the sorted list `arr` and returns the index of the last occurrence or `-1` if not found. The test cases provided in the original assessment cover various scenarios, such as arrays with multiple occurrences of the target element, a single occurrence, and the target element not being present in the array. Since the function behaves as expected in these cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
