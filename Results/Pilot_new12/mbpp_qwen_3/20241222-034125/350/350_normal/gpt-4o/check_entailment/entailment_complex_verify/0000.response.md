Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of the target element `x`. If the element is not found, the function returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. The original assessment was incorrect because the function handles both cases where the element is present and where it is not, making the program correct.
