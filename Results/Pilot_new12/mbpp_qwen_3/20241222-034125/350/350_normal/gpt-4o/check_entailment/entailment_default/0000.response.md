Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the last position of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr` by iterating through the array in reverse order. If the element is found, it immediately returns its index. If the element is not found, it returns `-1`. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate that the function works as expected:

- For `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)`, the last position of `1` is `0`.
- For `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, the last position of `1` is `2`.
- For `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)`, the last position of `3` is `3`.

The code handles all the provided examples correctly and the logic aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would make the function behave incorrectly based on the assumptions given. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
