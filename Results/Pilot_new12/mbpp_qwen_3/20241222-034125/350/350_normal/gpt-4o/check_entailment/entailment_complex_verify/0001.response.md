Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order, ensuring that it returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of the target element, a single occurrence, and the target element not being present in the array. The annotations also correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function execution, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
