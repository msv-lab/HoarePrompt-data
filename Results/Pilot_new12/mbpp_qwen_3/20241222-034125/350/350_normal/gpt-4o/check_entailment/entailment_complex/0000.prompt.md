You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and x is an integer.
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, and `i` is -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `i` is the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the last occurrence of the integer `x` in the sorted list `arr`. If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`. The function iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, checking each element against `x`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the current index. If no match is found after iterating through the entire list, the function returns `-1`. Potential edge cases include when `arr` is empty or contains only one element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
