Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates through the array in reverse order starting from the last element, which ensures that the first match encountered will be the last occurrence of `x`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Array**: If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `-1`, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.
   - **Single Element Array**: If `arr` contains only one element, the loop will execute once. If the single element matches `x`, the function will return `0` (the index), otherwise, it will return `-1`.
   
3. **Valid Input Assumption**: The program assumes valid inputs as specified in the problem description. Since the inputs are assumed to be valid (i.e., `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer), there is no need to add additional checks for these assumptions.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the correct value as per the problem description. If `x` is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description and works correctly for all potential valid cases.
