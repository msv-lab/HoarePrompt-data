Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, ensuring that the first match encountered is the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of the target element, a single occurrence, and the target element not being present in the array. The annotations also align with the expected behavior, indicating that the function correctly sets the variable `i` to the index of the last occurrence of `x` or `-1` if `x` is not found. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
