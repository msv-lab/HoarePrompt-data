Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, the program will not work correctly if the element `x` is not present in the array. For instance, consider the following case:

- Problem description: Find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `x = 6`
- Expected output: `-1` (since 6 is not present in the array)
- Program output: `None` (since the loop does not execute and the function returns -1, but it's not the last position)

To handle this case correctly, the program should check if the element is present in the array before returning -1. Here's an updated version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

The provided solution already returns -1 when the element is not found, which is the correct behavior. Therefore, the initial program is correct, but the explanation highlights the need to ensure the function handles the absence of the element correctly. Since the function already does this, the final answer remains:

Correctness: **True**.
