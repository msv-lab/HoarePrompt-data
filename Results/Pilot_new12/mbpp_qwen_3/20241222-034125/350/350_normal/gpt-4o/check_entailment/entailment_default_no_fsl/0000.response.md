Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, which ensures that it finds the last occurrence of `x`. The given test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of `x`, single occurrences, and the absence of `x`. Additionally, the code handles the case where the array is empty by returning `-1` as expected. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement.
