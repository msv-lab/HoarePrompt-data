Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not work correctly if the element `x` is not present in the array. However, the provided program already handles this case correctly by returning `-1` when the element is not found. The output hints confirm that the function returns `-1` when `x` is not found in `arr`, which aligns with the expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.
