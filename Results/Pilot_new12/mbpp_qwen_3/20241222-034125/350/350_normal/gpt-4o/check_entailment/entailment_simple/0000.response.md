Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the last position of a given element in a sorted array.
2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (the sorted list) and `x` (the target integer).
   - The function iterates through the list in reverse order using a `for` loop.
   - It checks each element to see if it matches `x`.
   - If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of that element.
   - If no match is found by the end of the loop, the function returns `-1`.

The provided assertions test various cases:
- An array with a single occurrence of the target element (`[1, 2, 3]` and `1`).
- An array with multiple occurrences of the target element (`[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `1`).
- An array with the target element at different positions (`[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and `3`).

The implementation correctly finds the last position of the element in all tested cases. The logic ensures that the search is performed in reverse order, which makes it efficient for finding the last occurrence of the element. Additionally, the function handles the case where the element is not present in the array by returning `-1`.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality for all the provided test cases, and it adheres to the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
