Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, which ensures that it returns the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of the target element, a single occurrence, and the target element not being present in the array. Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and the logic is sound for finding the last position, the program is correct.
