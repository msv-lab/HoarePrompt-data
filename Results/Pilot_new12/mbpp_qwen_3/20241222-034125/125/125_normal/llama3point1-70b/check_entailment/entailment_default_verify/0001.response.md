Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists at every nth element, as evidenced by the output hints and the examples provided. The function handles various edge cases such as an empty list, a list with fewer elements than `n`, and specific values of `n` (e.g., `n=1` and `n=len(lst)`). The provided examples also confirm that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness (`True`) is appropriate.
