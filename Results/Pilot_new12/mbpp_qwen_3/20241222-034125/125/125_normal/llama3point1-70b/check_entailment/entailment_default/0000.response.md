Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst, n)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`. Specifically, the function generates `n` sublists, each containing elements from `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter.

The code uses a list comprehension to achieve this:
```python
return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```
This list comprehension iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`, and for each starting index `i`, it slices the list `lst` starting from `i` with a step of `n`.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- For `n = 1`, it returns a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist.
- For `n` equal to the length of `lst`, it returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains exactly one element from `lst`.
- It handles the case where `lst` is empty or `n` is `0` by raising an error, which aligns with the precondition `0 < n <= len(lst)`.

Since the code correctly implements the described behavior for all potential cases and the output hints match the implementation, the correctness of the program is **True**.
