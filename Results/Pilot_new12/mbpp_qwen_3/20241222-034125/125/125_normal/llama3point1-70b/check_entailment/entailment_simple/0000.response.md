Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list into sublists at every nth element as described in the problem statement. Instead, it creates a list of slices where each slice starts from every index in the range `0` to `n-1` and steps by `n`. Here's why it does not meet the requirements:

- The problem description states: "Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists." 

- The code snippet actually generates slices that start at every index from `0` to `n-1`, stepping by `n`. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 3`, the output would be `[ [1, 4], [2, 5], [3] ]`.

- To correctly split the list at every nth element, the function should create sublists where each sublist contains elements that are `n` positions apart starting from each possible starting index within one full cycle of the list. For instance, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 3`, the correct output should be `[ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5] ]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function to meet the problem description:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst) // n + 1):
        result.append(lst[i * n:(i + 1) * n])
    return result
```

This corrected function will properly split the list into sublists at every nth element.
