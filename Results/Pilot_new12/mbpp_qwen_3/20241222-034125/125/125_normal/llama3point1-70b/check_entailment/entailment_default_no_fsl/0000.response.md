Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly split the list for every nth element as described. According to the problem description, the function should generate a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements from the original list at indices that are multiples of their respective starting index (i.e., starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter). However, the current implementation uses list slicing in a way that it creates sublists starting from every nth index, not from every index in a cyclic manner.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`. The expected output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the current code would produce `[[1, 3, 5], [2], [3], [4], [5]]`.

To fix this, the code should use a loop to create sublists starting from each index up to `n-1` and then take every nth element from that starting index. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(lst[i::n])
    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the function behaves as per the problem description for every potential case.
