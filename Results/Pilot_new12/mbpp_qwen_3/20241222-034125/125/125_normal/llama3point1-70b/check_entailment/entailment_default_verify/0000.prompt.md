You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not split the list for every nth element as described. Instead, it creates sublists starting from each index up to every nth element. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the expected output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the program returns `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5], [5]]`. This implementation does not meet the requirement of splitting the list for every nth element.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`. Specifically, the function generates `n` sublists, each containing elements from `lst` at positions that are multiples of their respective index (i.e., starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter). This operation is performed for each starting index from `0` to `n-1`. If `lst` is empty or `n` is `0`, the function will raise an error since `0 < n <= len(lst)` is a precondition. The function handles the case where `n` is equal to `1` by returning a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains exactly one element from `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
