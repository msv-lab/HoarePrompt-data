Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not split the list for every nth element as described. Instead, it creates sublists starting from each index up to every nth element. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the expected output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the program returns `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5], [5]]`. This implementation does not meet the requirement of splitting the list for every nth element.
