Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the described functionality. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. This matches the problem description which states that the function should take a list and an integer `n`.

2. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from the original list `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`. Specifically:
   - The expression `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` sublists.
   - Each sublist starts at index `i` and includes every `n`th element thereafter.
   - This matches the requirement to split the list every `n`th element.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing the original list as the only sublist. This is consistent with the description.
   - If `n` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains exactly one element. This is also correctly implemented.
   - If the list is empty, the function would technically not raise an error (since no elements are processed), but this is covered by the assumption that the input is valid.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
