The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of any type, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function returns a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a new list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are multiples of `n`.**
