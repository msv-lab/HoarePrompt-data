Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list for every nth element as described in the problem statement. Instead, it distributes elements across n sublists based on their index modulo n. This means that the first n elements will go into the first sublist, the next n elements into the second sublist, and so on.

For example, if we call `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the output will be:

```
[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]
```

Notice that the last sublist has an extra element ('n') because the distribution is based on index modulo 3, not splitting every third element.

To correctly implement the described functionality, the program should split the list into sublists every nth element. For example:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i+n])
    return result
```

This implementation correctly splits the list for every nth element, which matches the problem description.
