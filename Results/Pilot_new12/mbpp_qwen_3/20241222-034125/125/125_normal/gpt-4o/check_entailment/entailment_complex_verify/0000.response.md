Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not split the list every nth element as required by the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of sublists where each new sublist starts after skipping `n-1` elements. However, the current implementation creates sublists based on the index modulo `n`, which results in each sublist containing elements at positions that are congruent modulo `n`.

For example, with the input `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the expected output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]` to meet the problem description. However, the current implementation produces the same output, which does not align with the requirement of splitting the list every nth element.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
