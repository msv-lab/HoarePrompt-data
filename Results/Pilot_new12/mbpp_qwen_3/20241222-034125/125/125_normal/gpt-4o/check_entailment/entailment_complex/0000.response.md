Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as inputs and splits the list into sublists such that every nth element forms a new sublist. 

Here's why the function meets the requirements:

1. **Modulo Operation**: The function uses the modulo operation (`i % n`) to place each element in the appropriate sublist. This ensures that every nth element is grouped together.
   
2. **Result Initialization**: The `result` list is initialized with `n` empty sublists. This setup allows for the elements to be distributed into the correct sublists based on their index modulo `n`.

3. **Loop Through Elements**: The `for` loop iterates over each element in the input list `lst`. For each element, the index `i` is used to determine which sublist (`result[i % n]`) it should be appended to.

4. **Correct Output Format**: The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list that share the same index modulo `n`.

The assertions provided in the comments also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs, including different types of elements (strings and integers) and varying lengths of the list.

Therefore, the function `func_1` consistently achieves the intended behavior described in the problem statement.
