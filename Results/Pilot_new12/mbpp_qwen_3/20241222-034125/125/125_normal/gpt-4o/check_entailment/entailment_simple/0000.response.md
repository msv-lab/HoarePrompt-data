Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and splits the list into sublists such that each sublist contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` are the same. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list of empty lists (`result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`). This ensures that there are `n` sublists ready to hold the elements based on their index modulo `n`.

2. **Loop Through List**: The `for` loop iterates through each element in the list using `enumerate`. For each element, it calculates the index modulo `n` and appends the element to the corresponding sublist in `result`.

3. **Result Construction**: After processing all elements, the program returns the `result` list which contains the sublists as required.

The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:
- For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`.
- For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`.

Since the function correctly splits the list as specified and handles the examples without issues, the program is correct according to the problem description.
