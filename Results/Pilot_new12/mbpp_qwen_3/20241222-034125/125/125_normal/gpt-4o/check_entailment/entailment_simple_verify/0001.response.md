Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` distributes elements across `n` sublists based on their index modulo `n`, rather than splitting the list into sublists every `n`th element. This is evident from the annotated version of the code, which states that `result[j]` (where `j = index % n`) contains all the elements from `lst` that have the same index modulo `n`. This behavior does not align with the problem description, which requires splitting the list into sublists every `n`th element.

The provided solution in the annotations does not match the problem description, and the original implementation does not achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is correct.
