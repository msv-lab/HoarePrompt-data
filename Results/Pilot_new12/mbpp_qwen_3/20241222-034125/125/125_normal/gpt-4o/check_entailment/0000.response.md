Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list every nth element but rather splits the list into n sublists where each sublist contains elements at positions that are congruent modulo n. This means that for `n=3`, the first sublist contains elements at positions 0, 3, 6, etc., the second sublist contains elements at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., and so on.

To meet the problem description correctly, the program should create sublists such that each new sublist starts after skipping `n-1` elements. However, the current implementation creates sublists by taking elements based on their index modulo n, which is not the same as splitting the list every nth element.

For example, consider the following input:
```
func_1(['x', 'y', 'z', 'w', 'v', 'u', 't', 's', 'r', 'q', 'p', 'o'], 3)
```
The expected output according to the problem description would be:
```
[['x', 'w', 't', 'q'], ['y', 'v', 's', 'p'], ['z', 'u', 'r', 'o']]
```
But the actual output from the provided code would be:
```
[['x', 'w', 't', 'q'], ['y', 'v', 's', 'p'], ['z', 'u', 'r', 'o']]
```
This is actually correct according to the current implementation, but it does not match the problem description of splitting the list every nth element. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the given problem description.
