You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list every nth element but rather splits the list into n sublists where each sublist contains elements at positions that are congruent modulo n. This means that for `n=3`, the first sublist contains elements at positions 0, 3, 6, etc., the second sublist contains elements at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., and so on.

To meet the problem description correctly, the program should create sublists such that each new sublist starts after skipping `n-1` elements. However, the current implementation creates sublists by taking elements based on their index modulo n, which is not the same as splitting the list every nth element.

For example, consider the following input:
```
func_1(['x', 'y', 'z', 'w', 'v', 'u', 't', 's', 'r', 'q', 'p', 'o'], 3)
```
The expected output according to the problem description would be:
```
[['x', 'w', 't', 'q'], ['y', 'v', 's', 'p'], ['z', 'u', 'r', 'o']]
```
But the actual output from the provided code would be:
```
[['x', 'w', 't', 'q'], ['y', 'v', 's', 'p'], ['z', 'u', 'r', 'o']]
```
This is actually correct according to the current implementation, but it does not match the problem description of splitting the list every nth element. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a new list `result` where each element from `lst` is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`. After executing the function, the final state of the program includes:
- `result`: A list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.
- `i`: The length of the original list `lst`.
- `element`: The last element in the original list `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
