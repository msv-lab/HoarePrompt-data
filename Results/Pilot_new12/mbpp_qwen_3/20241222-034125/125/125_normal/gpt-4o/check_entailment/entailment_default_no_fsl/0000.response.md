Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the described functionality. It splits the input list into sublists based on the modulo operation with the given integer `n`. The assertions provided in the problem description cover different scenarios, including lists with different lengths and elements of different types (strings and integers). The code handles these cases correctly, as demonstrated by the assertions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case given the assumptions about valid input.
