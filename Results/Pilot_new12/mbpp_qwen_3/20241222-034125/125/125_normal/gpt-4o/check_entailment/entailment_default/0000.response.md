Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it splits the list into sublists where each element from `lst` is placed in a sublist based on the modulo operation with `n`. This ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the resulting sublists.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`:
   - The output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`.
   - This correctly groups every 3rd element together.

2. For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`:
   - The output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`.
   - This also correctly groups every 3rd element together.

3. For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`:
   - The output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`.
   - This correctly groups every 2nd element together.

Since the code works as expected for the provided examples and the logic correctly splits the list for every `n`th element, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
