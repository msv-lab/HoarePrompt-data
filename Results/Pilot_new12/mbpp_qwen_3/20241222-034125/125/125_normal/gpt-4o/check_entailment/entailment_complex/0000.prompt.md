You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any elements, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0 and n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(lst)`, `element` is the last element in `lst`, `result[j]` (where `j = index % n`) contains all the elements from `lst` that have the same index modulo `n`.
    return result
    #`result` contains elements from `lst` where each element is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`, and `i` is the length of `lst`, `element` is the last element in `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a new list `result` where each element from `lst` is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`. After executing the function, the final state of the program includes:
- `result`: A list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.
- `i`: The length of the original list `lst`.
- `element`: The last element in the original list `lst`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
