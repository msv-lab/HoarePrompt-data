Output State: **`i` is `len(lst)`, `element` is the last element in `lst`, `result[j]` (where `j = index % n`) contains all the elements from `lst` that have the same index modulo `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst` using `enumerate`, meaning `i` will increment from 0 to `len(lst) - 1` and `element` will take the value of each element in `lst` in sequence.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(lst)`, and `element` will be the last element in `lst`.
- For each iteration, `result[i % n]` appends the current `element` to its respective sublist. Therefore, each sublist in `result` will contain elements from `lst` that share the same index modulo `n`.
