The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of any elements, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0` and `n <= len(lst)`. The function returns a result that contains elements from `lst` where each element is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`. Additionally, `i` is the length of `lst`, and `element` is the last element in `lst`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a result based on the specified index condition, along with the length of `lst` and the last element in `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a result containing elements from `lst` where each element's index satisfies a specific condition, along with the length of `lst` and the last element in `lst`.**
