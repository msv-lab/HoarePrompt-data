State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of any elements, `n` is a positive integer such that \( n > 0 \) and \( n \leq \text{len}(lst) \), `result` is a list of \( n \) empty lists.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions need to be met:
1. The list `lst` must contain at least \( n \) elements because the loop will iterate over `enumerate(lst)`, and the length of `lst` must be at least \( n \).
2. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.
3. The variable `element` will be the corresponding element in `lst` for each iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- Ensure `lst` has at least \( n \) elements.
- Initialize `i` to 0.
- Initialize `element` to the first element of `lst`.

State: **`lst` is a list of any elements that must have at least \( n \) elements, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**
