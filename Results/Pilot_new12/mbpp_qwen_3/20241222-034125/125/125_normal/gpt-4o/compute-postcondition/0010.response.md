Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a new list `result` where each element from `lst` is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`. After executing the function, the final state of the program includes:
- `result`: A list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.
- `i`: The length of the original list `lst`.
- `element`: The last element in the original list `lst`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality considered:**
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the elements will still be distributed based on the modulo operation, ensuring no elements are left out.
- The function correctly handles the case when `n` is equal to the length of `lst`, placing each element in its own sublist within `result`.
- The function also correctly identifies the last element in `lst` and assigns it to the variable `element`.**

This summary captures the essence of the function's behavior and ensures all relevant aspects are covered.
