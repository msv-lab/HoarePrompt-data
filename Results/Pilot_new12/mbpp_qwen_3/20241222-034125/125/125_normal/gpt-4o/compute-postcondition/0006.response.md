Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `element` is the third element in `lst`
   - `result[0]` contains the third element in `lst`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `result[i % n].append(element)` is executed.
   - Here, `i` is 3, so `i % n` would evaluate to `3 % n`.
     - Since `n` is not defined in the initial state and there's no context about its value, let's assume `n` is the length of `lst` (since `element` is the third element in `lst`).
   - Let's denote the length of `lst` as `len(lst)`. Given that `element` is the third element in `lst`, we know `lst[2]` is `element`.
   - Therefore, `3 % len(lst)` will evaluate to `3 % len(lst)`.
     - If `len(lst)` is greater than 3, `3 % len(lst)` will be between 0 and `len(lst) - 1`.
     - If `len(lst)` is exactly 3, `3 % 3` is 0.
     - In either case, the index will be within the bounds of `result`.

3. **Effect on Variables:**
   - `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still 3.
   - `element` remains unchanged, so `element` is still the third element in `lst`.
   - `result[i % n]` is appended with `element`. So, if `i % len(lst)` evaluates to 0, `result[0]` will append `element`. Since `result[0]` already contains the third element in `lst`, appending `element` again means `result[0]` now contains two occurrences of the third element in `lst`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `element` is the third element in `lst`
   - `result[0]` now contains two occurrences of the third element in `lst`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `element` is the third element in `lst`, `result[0]` contains two occurrences of the third element in `lst`.**
