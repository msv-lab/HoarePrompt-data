The code creates a new list `result` containing `n` empty lists. Each element of `result` is an empty list. The length of `result` is `n`. The original list `lst` and its elements, as well as the value of `n`, are unaffected.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of any elements, `n` is a positive integer such that n > 0 and n <= len(lst), `result` is a list of `n` empty lists**
