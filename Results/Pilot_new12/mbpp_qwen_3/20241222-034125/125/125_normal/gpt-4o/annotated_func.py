#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any elements, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0 and n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(lst)`, `element` is the last element in `lst`, `result[j]` (where `j = index % n`) contains all the elements from `lst` that have the same index modulo `n`.
    return result
    #`result` contains elements from `lst` where each element is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`, and `i` is the length of `lst`, `element` is the last element in `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a new list `result` where each element from `lst` is placed at an index such that `index % n` matches its original index in `lst`. After executing the function, the final state of the program includes:
- `result`: A list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.
- `i`: The length of the original list `lst`.
- `element`: The last element in the original list `lst`.
