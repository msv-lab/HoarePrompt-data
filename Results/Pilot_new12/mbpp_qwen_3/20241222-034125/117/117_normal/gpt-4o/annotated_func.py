#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the sum of 1 for each integer element in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list. The function iterates through each element in the list, checks if the element is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`, and increments the sum by 1 for each integer found. This process counts the number of integer elements in the list. Potential edge cases include lists that may contain non-integer types, such as strings, floats, or other objects, which are ignored in the count. The function does not modify the original list and only returns the count of integers.
