Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list based on the problem description. The function iterates through each element in the list and uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if the element is an integer, incrementing the sum for each integer found. The test cases provided cover various scenarios and the function behaves as expected. The output hints further confirm that the function accurately counts the integer elements in the list. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
