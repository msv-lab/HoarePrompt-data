Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the number of integer elements in that list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of elements that are instances of the `int` class. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list.
2. **Logic**: The function iterates over each element in the list and uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if the element is an integer. For each integer found, `sum` adds 1 to the total count.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of integer elements in the list.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`: The list contains two integers (1, 2).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3`: The list contains three integers (1, 2, 3).
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`: The list contains two integers (1, 4).

Since the program correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list and the provided test cases confirm this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
