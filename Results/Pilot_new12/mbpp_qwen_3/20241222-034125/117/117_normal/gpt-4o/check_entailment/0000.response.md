Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` type. The provided test cases assert the function works correctly for lists containing integers, strings, and floats. Since the function handles all these cases as expected, and no other edge cases were found that would make the function incorrect, the program is considered correct.
