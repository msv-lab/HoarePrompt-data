Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` type. 

The test cases provided cover different scenarios:
1. A list containing integers and non-integer elements: `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]` should return `2`.
2. A list containing only integers: `[1, 2, 3]` should return `3`.
3. A list containing both integers and floating-point numbers: `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]` should return `2`.

Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the logic is sound, it is correct according to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make this function fail based on the provided information.
