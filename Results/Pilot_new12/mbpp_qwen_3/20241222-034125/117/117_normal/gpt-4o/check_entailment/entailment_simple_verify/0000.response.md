Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` iterates over the list `lst` and uses a generator expression to count the number of elements that are instances of the `int` type. The provided test cases assert that the function correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given lists. The annotations align with the function's behavior and confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
