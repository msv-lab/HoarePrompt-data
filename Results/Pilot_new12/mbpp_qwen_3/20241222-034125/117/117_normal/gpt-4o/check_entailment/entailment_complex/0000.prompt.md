You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the sum of 1 for each integer element in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list. The function iterates through each element in the list, checks if the element is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`, and increments the sum by 1 for each integer found. This process counts the number of integer elements in the list. Potential edge cases include lists that may contain non-integer types, such as strings, floats, or other objects, which are ignored in the count. The function does not modify the original list and only returns the count of integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
