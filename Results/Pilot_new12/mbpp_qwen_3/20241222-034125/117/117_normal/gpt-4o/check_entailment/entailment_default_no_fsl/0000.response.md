Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the number of integer elements in the list. The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that only integer elements are counted. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with mixed types (including strings and floats), lists with all integers, and an empty list (though the empty list case is not explicitly tested). Since the code handles all potential cases as described and the provided examples work as expected, the code is correct.
