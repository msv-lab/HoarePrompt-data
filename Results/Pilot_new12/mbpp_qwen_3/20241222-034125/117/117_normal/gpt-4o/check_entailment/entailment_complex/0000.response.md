Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of integer elements in a given list. The function iterates over each element in the list and uses the `isinstance(x, int)` check to determine if the element is an integer. It then returns the count of such elements using the `sum()` function with a generator expression.

Given the problem description, the function should:
- Accept a list as input.
- Count and return the number of integer elements in the list.

The function meets these criteria:
- It takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list.
- It correctly counts the number of integer elements by checking each element using `isinstance(x, int)`.
- It returns the count as required.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement and handles all elements appropriately (ignoring non-integer types), the program is correct.
