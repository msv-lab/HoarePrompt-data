Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list based on the problem description. The annotations clarify that the function iterates over the list and sums up the instances where each element is an instance of the `int` type. The test cases validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, confirming its correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
