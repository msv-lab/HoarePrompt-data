#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of True values (which represent integers) from the expression `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements in the list. Specifically, it iterates through each element in the list, checks if the element is an instance of the `int` class using the `isinstance()` function, and counts the number of times this condition evaluates to `True`. If the list is empty, the function will return `0`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the provided code, but the function correctly handles an empty list by returning `0`.
