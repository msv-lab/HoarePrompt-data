Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` inside the `sum` function. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each element, checks if it is an instance of `int`, and counts the occurrences where this condition is met. It also handles an empty list by returning `0`. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, there is no need to change the original assessment.
