Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `sum` with a generator expression that checks if each element in the list is an instance of `int`. This approach correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list. Since the function works for any list containing elements that can be checked against `isinstance(int)`, it meets the requirement for counting integer elements without any missing logic or edge cases that would make it incorrect.
