Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in the list and check if it is an instance of the `int` class. If the list is empty, it returns `0`, which aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the code that suggest any issues, and the logic seems sound for counting integer elements in a list.
