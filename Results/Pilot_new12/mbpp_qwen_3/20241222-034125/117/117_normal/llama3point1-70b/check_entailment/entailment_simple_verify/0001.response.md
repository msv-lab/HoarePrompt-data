Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list `lst` by using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` evaluates to `True` for each integer element and `False` otherwise, which `sum` then adds up to give the total count of integer elements. Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
