Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements in the list. It achieves this by iterating through each element in the list, checking if the element is an instance of the `int` class using the `isinstance()` function, and counting the number of times this condition evaluates to `True`. 

The function correctly handles an empty list by returning `0`, as there are no integer elements to count. The logic within the function ensures that only integer elements contribute to the final count, making the function behave as expected according to the problem description.
