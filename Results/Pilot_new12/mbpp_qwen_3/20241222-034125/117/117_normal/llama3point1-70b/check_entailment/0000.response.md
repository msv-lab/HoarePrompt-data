Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` inside the `sum` function. This approach leverages the fact that `sum` will sum up the truth values (`True` for integers and `False` for non-integers), effectively counting the number of integers in the list. Since this method works for all potential cases (including empty lists and lists with mixed data types), the function is correct according to the problem description.
