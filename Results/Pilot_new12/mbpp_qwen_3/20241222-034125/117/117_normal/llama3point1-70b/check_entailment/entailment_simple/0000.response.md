Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in that list. It achieves this by using a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst`, which evaluates to `True` for each integer element and `False` otherwise. The `sum()` function then counts the number of `True` values, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to count integer elements in the list and does not require handling invalid inputs (as per the given assumption), it is correct according to the problem description.
