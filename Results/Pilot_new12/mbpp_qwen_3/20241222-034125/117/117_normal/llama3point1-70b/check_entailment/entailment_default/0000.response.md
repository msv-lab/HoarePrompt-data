Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of elements that are instances of the `int` class. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty list, as it returns `0` in such scenarios. The output hints confirm that the function accurately counts the integer elements, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Thus, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
