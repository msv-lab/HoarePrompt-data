Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the given code, as it correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the calculated volume of the cone.**

Given the return postconditions and the annotated code, the function correctly computes and returns the volume of a cone based on the provided radius and height. No additional edge cases or missing functionalities need to be considered.
