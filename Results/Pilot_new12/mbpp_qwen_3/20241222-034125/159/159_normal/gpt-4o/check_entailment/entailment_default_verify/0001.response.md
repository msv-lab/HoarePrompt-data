Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, as evidenced by the test cases provided in the assertions. The output hints confirm that the function accepts non-negative floating-point numbers for both `radius` and `height`, and correctly calculates the volume using the given formula. Since there are no apparent edge cases or errors in the provided code and it adheres to the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
