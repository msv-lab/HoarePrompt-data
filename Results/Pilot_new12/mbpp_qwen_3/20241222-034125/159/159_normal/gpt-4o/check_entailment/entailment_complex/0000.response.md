Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the function to calculate the volume of a cone based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative floating-point numbers. It uses the formula for the volume of a cone, \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), and returns the calculated volume. The provided assertions verify that the function works correctly for different inputs, ensuring that it consistently returns the expected volume values. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
