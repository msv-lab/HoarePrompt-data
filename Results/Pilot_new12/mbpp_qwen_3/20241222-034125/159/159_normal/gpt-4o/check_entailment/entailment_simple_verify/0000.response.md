Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative floating-point numbers. The function correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where `math.pi` is used for \(\pi\). The provided test cases also match the expected results within the specified relative tolerance, indicating that the function works as intended. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the program is correct.
