Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The assertions in the code verify the correctness of the function for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints that suggest the code is incorrect. The code handles the inputs as non-negative floating-point numbers and computes the volume accurately. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
