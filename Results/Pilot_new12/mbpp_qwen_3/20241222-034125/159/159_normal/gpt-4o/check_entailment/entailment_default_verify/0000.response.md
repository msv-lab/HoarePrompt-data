Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where `radius` and `height` are the inputs. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the implementation, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for non-negative floating-point inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
