Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The test cases provided in the assertions confirm that the function returns the expected values for the given inputs. Since the function follows the problem description for the provided cases and the mathematical formula is correct, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works correctly for the volume calculation of a cone. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the given code that would cause it to fail for other potential cases.
