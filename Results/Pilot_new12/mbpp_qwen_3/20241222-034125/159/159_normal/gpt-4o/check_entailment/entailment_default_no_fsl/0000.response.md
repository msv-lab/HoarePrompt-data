Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The assertions in the code verify the function against three different sets of inputs, and the function passes these tests. The output hints also confirm that the function handles the expected inputs correctly and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
