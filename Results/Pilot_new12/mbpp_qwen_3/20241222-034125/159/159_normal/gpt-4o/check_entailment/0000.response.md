Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The program uses `math.pi` for the value of \(\pi\) and applies the formula correctly. The provided test cases also match the expected results within the specified relative tolerance. Since the program handles the given problem description correctly and the provided examples work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
