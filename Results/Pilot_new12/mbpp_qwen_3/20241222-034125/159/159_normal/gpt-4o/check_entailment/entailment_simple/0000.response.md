Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), is the correct formula for calculating the volume of a cone. The function takes two arguments, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative floating-point numbers as stated in the problem description. 

The provided assertions test the function with different sets of inputs and compare the output to expected values using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001. Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone and the assertions pass for the given test cases, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
