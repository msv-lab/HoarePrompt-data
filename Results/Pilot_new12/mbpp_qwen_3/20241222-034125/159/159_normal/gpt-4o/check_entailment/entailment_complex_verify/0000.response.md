Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers. The provided test cases match the expected results within the specified relative tolerance, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotation. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
