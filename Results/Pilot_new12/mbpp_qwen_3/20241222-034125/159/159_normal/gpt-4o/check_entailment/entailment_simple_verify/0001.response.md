Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The provided test cases confirm that the function returns the expected values for the given inputs. The annotated version of the code clarifies that `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers, ensuring that the function will behave as expected within the scope of the problem description. Since the function meets the problem requirements and there are no apparent issues or edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
