#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative floating-point numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns 1/3 * math.pi * radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative floating-point numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the given code, as it correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the calculated volume of the cone.
