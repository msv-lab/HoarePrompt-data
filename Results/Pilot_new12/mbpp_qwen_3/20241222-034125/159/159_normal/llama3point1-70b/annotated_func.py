#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns 1/3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` as parameters. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function does not perform any additional checks or operations beyond this calculation. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the calculated volume of the cone.
