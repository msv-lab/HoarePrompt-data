The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` as parameters. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function does not perform any additional checks or operations beyond this calculation. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the calculated volume of the cone.
