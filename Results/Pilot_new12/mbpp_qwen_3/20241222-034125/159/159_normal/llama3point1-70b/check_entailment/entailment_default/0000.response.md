Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height}\). The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` as parameters and returns the volume of the cone using the given formula. There are no additional checks or operations beyond this calculation, and the function does not rely on any external conditions or inputs that would cause it to behave incorrectly. Given that the problem description specifies valid non-negative real numbers for both `radius` and `height`, the function will work correctly for all such inputs.
