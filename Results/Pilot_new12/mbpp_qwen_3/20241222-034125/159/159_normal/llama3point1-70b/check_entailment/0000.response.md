Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. This formula is correct and the implementation follows it accurately. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that this program would fail for, as it handles the calculation correctly for any positive real numbers for radius and height. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
