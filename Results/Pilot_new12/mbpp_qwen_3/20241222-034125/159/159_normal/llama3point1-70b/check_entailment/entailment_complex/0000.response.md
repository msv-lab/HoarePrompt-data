Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative real numbers, as required. The function then calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \) and returns the result. The function does not perform any additional checks or operations beyond this calculation, which aligns with the problem description. Since the inputs are assumed to be valid (non-negative real numbers), the function will always compute the volume of a cone correctly according to the given formula.
