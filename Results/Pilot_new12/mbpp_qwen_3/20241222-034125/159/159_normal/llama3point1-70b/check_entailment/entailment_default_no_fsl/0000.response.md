Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function takes two non-negative real numbers as parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. There are no additional checks or operations beyond this calculation, and the function does not handle invalid inputs (since we assume valid inputs as per the instruction). Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
