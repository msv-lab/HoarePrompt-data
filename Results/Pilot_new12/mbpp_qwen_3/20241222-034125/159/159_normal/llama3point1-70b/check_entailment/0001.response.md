Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. This formula is accurate and the function implements it correctly. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, and the given function meets this requirement for all potential cases, the function is correct.
