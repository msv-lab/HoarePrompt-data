Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the correct formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function `func_1` takes two non-negative real numbers as parameters and performs the necessary calculation without any additional checks or operations beyond the formula. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the calculated volume of the cone for valid inputs. Since the program meets the problem description and there are no issues or edge cases identified, the original assessment is accurate.
