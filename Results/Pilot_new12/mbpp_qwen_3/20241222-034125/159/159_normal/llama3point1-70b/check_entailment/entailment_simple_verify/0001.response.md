Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The state annotations indicate that the inputs `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, ensuring that the function will behave as expected without causing any errors (e.g., division by zero or invalid operations). Given that the problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, and the provided function accurately implements the necessary formula, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
