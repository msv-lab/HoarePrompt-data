Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` as parameters. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function does not perform any additional checks or operations beyond this calculation. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the calculated volume of the cone.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. If these values were negative or not real numbers, the function would still perform the calculation without any error handling or validation.
- There are no checks for type or value validation in the provided code. If `radius` or `height` were not real numbers, the function would raise a TypeError when performing mathematical operations.
- The function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are zero, which would result in a volume of zero. This behavior is consistent with the mathematical formula, but it might be worth noting for clarity.
