#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is the length of the list such that n >= 2.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers, and n is the length of the list such that n is greater than or equal to 2

            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, and `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between any two adjacent elements in `arr`. If the loop does not execute, `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff which is the smallest difference found between any two adjacent elements in list 'arr', or float('inf') if the loop does not execute
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. It returns 0 in the case where the list is too short (less than 2 elements), or the smallest difference found between any two adjacent elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, the function returns 0, as the initial check ensures this. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function sorts the list in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The function returns this minimum difference, or `float('inf')` if the loop does not execute (i.e., when the list has exactly 2 elements).
