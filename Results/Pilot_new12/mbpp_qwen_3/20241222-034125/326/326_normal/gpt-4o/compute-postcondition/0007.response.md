Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `min_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`. `diff` is the difference between the (i+1)-th element and the i-th element of `arr` and this new value of `diff` is less than the previous value of `min_diff`***
