The code calculates the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` and assigns it to `diff`. Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `arr[i + 1]` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. However, the specific values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `diff`. The value of `i` is also not specified, but we know it is `k + 1` from the previous iteration. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and `n` is at least 1 remains valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `min_diff` is updated to the smallest difference found between adjacent elements in `arr` or remains unchanged, and `diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`.**
