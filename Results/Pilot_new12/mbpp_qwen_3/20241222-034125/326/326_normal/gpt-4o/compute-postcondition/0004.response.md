The code initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not change the values of the existing variables but sets a new variable `min_diff` to a specific value.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is the same as before, `min_diff` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
