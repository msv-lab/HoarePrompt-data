`arr` is sorted in ascending order. The length of the list `arr` remains the same, which is `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and its length `n` is the same as before.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `n` is the same as before.**
