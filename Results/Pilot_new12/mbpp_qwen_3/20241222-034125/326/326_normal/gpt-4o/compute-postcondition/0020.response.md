The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

Case_1: The function returns 0.
Case_2: The function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference found between any two adjacent elements in the list `arr`, or `float('inf')` if the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and its length `n`, and return 0 in certain cases, or the smallest difference between any two adjacent elements in the list, or `float('inf')` if no adjacent elements are found.
