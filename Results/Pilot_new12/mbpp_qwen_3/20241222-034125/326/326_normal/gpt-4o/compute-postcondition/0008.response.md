The code `min_diff = diff` updates the value of `min_diff` to the current value of `diff`. Given that `diff` is the difference between the (i+1)-th element and the i-th element of `arr` and this new value of `diff` is less than the previous value of `min_diff`, `min_diff` is now set to this new, smaller value of `diff`.

The states of the other variables (`arr`, `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `min_diff` is updated to the value of the new `diff` which is less than the previous `min_diff`.**
