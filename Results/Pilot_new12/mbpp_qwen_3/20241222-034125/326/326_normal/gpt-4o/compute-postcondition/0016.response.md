The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Given the initial state where `min_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is less than `min_diff`, and `diff` is defined as the difference between `arr[k + 3]` and `arr[k + 2]`, the value of `min_diff` will now be equal to this difference.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `min_diff` is equal to `diff` (which is `arr[k + 3] - arr[k + 2]`), and `diff` is the difference between `arr[k + 3]` and `arr[k + 2]`.**
