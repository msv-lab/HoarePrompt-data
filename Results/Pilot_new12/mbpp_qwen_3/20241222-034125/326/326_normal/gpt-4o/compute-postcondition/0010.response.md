Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `min_diff` is either the smallest difference found between adjacent elements in `arr` or it remains unchanged if no such update occurred.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - For each iteration, the loop calculates the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` and updates `min_diff` if this difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's say `i` was `k` (where `0 <= k < n - 2`).
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` and `arr[k + 1]` were compared, and possibly `min_diff` was updated if the difference was smaller.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will now be `k + 1`.
   - The new pair of elements to compare will be `arr[k + 1]` and `arr[k + 2]`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `arr` remains the same since it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified either.
   - `min_diff` could remain unchanged or be updated to a new value based on the comparison of `arr[k + 1]` and `arr[k + 2]`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`, so we need to set `i` to `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Hence, `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `min_diff` remains unchanged or could be updated based on the comparison of `arr[k + 1]` and `arr[k + 2]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `min_diff` after the previous iteration, we'll keep it as `min_diff` without specifying its exact value.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is at least 1, and `min_diff` is updated to the smallest difference found between adjacent elements in `arr`. If no update occurs, `min_diff` remains unchanged. `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
