Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. It returns 0 in the case where the list is too short (less than 2 elements), or the smallest difference found between any two adjacent elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, the function returns 0, as the initial check ensures this. If the list has 2 or more elements, the function sorts the list in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The function returns this minimum difference, or `float('inf')` if the loop does not execute (i.e., when the list has exactly 2 elements).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n < 2`, the function immediately returns 0 without performing any further operations.
- If the list has exactly 2 elements, the function still sorts the list and finds the difference between these two elements, returning this value as `min_diff`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle cases where `arr` contains non-integer values. If `arr` contains non-integer elements, the function would raise a `TypeError` during the sorting operation. However, the current postconditions do not account for this scenario, so it is implied that `arr` should contain only integers.
