According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop `for i in range(n - 1)` will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `n` must be at least 1. The list `arr` being sorted in ascending order and the initial value of `min_diff` being infinity (`float('inf')`) are conditions that don't affect the ability of the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `min_diff` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
