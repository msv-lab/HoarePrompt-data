Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. It first checks if the length of the array is less than 2, returning 0 in such cases since there would be no difference to calculate. Then, it sorts the array and iterates through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected. Given the logic and the test cases, the function handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
