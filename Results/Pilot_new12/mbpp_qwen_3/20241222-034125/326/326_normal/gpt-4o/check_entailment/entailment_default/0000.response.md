Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as inputs and returns the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The code first checks if the array has fewer than 2 elements, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the array and iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the provided assertions. Given the nature of the problem and the provided examples, the code seems to cover all necessary cases. The function handles arrays with different lengths and values, ensuring that the minimum difference is correctly calculated. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
