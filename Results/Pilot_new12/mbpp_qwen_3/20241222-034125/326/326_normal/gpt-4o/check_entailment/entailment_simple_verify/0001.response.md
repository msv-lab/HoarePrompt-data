Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotations support this by clearly indicating the state of the program at each step, confirming that the function correctly handles the sorting of the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the minimum difference. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios, further supporting the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
