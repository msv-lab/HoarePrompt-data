Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program handles the edge case where the array length is less than 2 by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description. The sorting and iteration process to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements is also implemented correctly. The provided test cases and output hints further confirm that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
