Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such cases. It then sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the minimum difference. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including arrays with repeated elements and non-repeated elements, and the function passes these tests. Since the function appears to handle all cases correctly based on the given examples, the program is considered correct.
