Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list. It returns an integer representing the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - If `n < 2`, the function immediately returns 0. This is because with fewer than 2 elements, there are no pairs to compare, and thus the minimum difference is considered to be 0.
   - This handles the edge case where the input array might have less than 2 elements.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array is sorted in ascending order using `arr = sorted(arr)`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that we can easily find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements.

4. **Finding the Minimum Difference**:
   - A variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). This ensures that any real difference found in the array will be smaller.
   - The function iterates through the sorted array, comparing each pair of consecutive elements to update `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `min_diff`, which holds the smallest difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted array.

### Validation:
- The provided test cases in the form of assertions validate the function against different scenarios:
  - `func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6)` should return 1.
  - `func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4)` should return 1.
  - `func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4)` should return 4.

Given that the function correctly handles all specified cases and the problem description, the program is correct.
