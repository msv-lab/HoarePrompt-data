Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `n` (the length of the list). The problem description specifies that the function should accept these two parameters.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function checks if the length of the list (`n`) is less than 2. If true, it returns 0. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that if the list has fewer than 2 elements, the function should return 0.

3. **Sorting and Finding Minimum Difference**: For lists with 2 or more elements, the function sorts the list in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. This step ensures that the function correctly identifies the minimum difference.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the smallest difference found or `float('inf')` if no differences are calculated (which should not happen as the loop will always execute for a list with at least 2 elements).

Given these points, the program accurately fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
