Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code and output hints confirm that the function handles all cases appropriately. The function checks if the array size is less than 2 and returns 0 if so. For arrays with 2 or more elements, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the minimum difference. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes them. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
