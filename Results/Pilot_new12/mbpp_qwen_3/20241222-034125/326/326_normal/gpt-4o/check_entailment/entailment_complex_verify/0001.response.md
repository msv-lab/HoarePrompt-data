Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The annotations clearly indicate that the function first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such cases. For arrays with `n` greater than or equal to 2, the function sorts the array and then iterates through adjacent elements to find the minimum difference. The annotations also confirm that the function correctly identifies the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted array. Given the test cases provided and the detailed annotations, the function behaves as expected and meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
