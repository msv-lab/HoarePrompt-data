Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function handles the problem description accurately. The test cases provided also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
