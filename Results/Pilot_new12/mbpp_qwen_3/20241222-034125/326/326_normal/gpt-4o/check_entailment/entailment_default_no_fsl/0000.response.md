Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2 and returns 0 if true. Otherwise, it sorts the array and iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement. The output hints align with the implementation, and the provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function.
