You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of why the function works as expected:

1. The function first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent to each other.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity to ensure any valid difference found during the iteration will be smaller.
3. It iterates through the sorted array, comparing each element with its next neighbor to calculate the difference.
4. If a smaller difference is found, it updates `min_diff`.

Given these steps, the function will correctly identify the minimum difference between any two elements in the array for any valid input. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr` in non-decreasing order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this minimum difference. If the list `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function will still attempt to calculate the difference, which would result in `None` being assigned to `min_diff` (since the initial value of `min_diff` is `float('inf')`). However, this case is not explicitly handled in the code, so the function will return `float('inf')` as the minimum difference. The overall purpose of the function is to find the smallest gap between any two consecutive numbers in the given list `arr`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
