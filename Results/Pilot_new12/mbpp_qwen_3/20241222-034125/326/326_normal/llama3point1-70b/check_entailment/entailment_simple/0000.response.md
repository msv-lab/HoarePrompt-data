Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an array (`arr`) as input, which is a list of integers, and an integer (`target`). However, the problem description specifies that the function should only consider the array (`arr`), and the `target` parameter is unused in the function. Despite this unused parameter, the function correctly processes the array `arr`.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The function first sorts the array in non-decreasing order using `sorted(arr)`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that consecutive elements in the array are the closest to each other, allowing us to easily find the minimum difference.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function initializes `min_diff` to `float('inf')` to ensure that any actual difference found will be smaller than this initial value. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements. If a smaller difference is found, it updates `min_diff`.

4. **Returning the Result**: After the loop, the function returns `min_diff`, which holds the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty array (though the problem description doesn't explicitly mention this case). In such a scenario, sorting an empty list does nothing, and `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`, resulting in `min_diff` being returned as `inf`, which is technically correct as there are no pairs of elements to compare.

Given that the function correctly sorts the array and iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
