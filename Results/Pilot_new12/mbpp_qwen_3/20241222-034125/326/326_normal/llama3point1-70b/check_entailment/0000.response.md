Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements and updating the minimum difference accordingly. This approach guarantees that the minimum difference is found for any given array, as long as the array contains at least two elements. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
