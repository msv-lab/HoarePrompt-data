Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of why the function works as expected:

1. The function first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent to each other.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity to ensure any valid difference found during the iteration will be smaller.
3. It iterates through the sorted array, comparing each element with its next neighbor to calculate the difference.
4. If a smaller difference is found, it updates `min_diff`.

Given these steps, the function will correctly identify the minimum difference between any two elements in the array for any valid input. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
