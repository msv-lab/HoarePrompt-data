Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`) and an integer (`target`). Although the `target` parameter is not used in the function, the function still operates correctly by ignoring this unused parameter. This is acceptable as per the problem description, which focuses on finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the input list `arr` in non-decreasing order using `arr = sorted(arr)`. Sorting ensures that the elements are in ascending order, making it straightforward to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted list and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements (`diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`). It keeps track of the minimum difference found so far (`min_diff`). By the end of the loop, `min_diff` holds the smallest gap between any two consecutive numbers in the list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the minimum difference found (`return min_diff`). If the list `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function correctly initializes `min_diff` to `float('inf')` and thus returns `float('inf')` as the minimum difference, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Since the program accurately implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
