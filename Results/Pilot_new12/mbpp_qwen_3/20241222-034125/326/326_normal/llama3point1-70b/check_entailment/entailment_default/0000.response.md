Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first sorts the array in non-decreasing order, ensuring that consecutive elements are as close as possible. It then iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The initialization of `min_diff` to `float('inf')` ensures that any actual difference found during the iteration will be smaller, thus correctly identifying the minimum difference. The function handles all potential cases, including arrays with fewer than two elements, by returning `float('inf')` as specified. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that indicate the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
