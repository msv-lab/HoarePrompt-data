Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` is named to suggest it takes two parameters (`arr` and `target`), but the actual implementation only uses the `arr` parameter and ignores the `target` parameter entirely. According to the problem description, the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, which it does correctly. However, the presence of the unused `target` parameter indicates that the code does not meet the full requirements specified in the problem description. Since the function does not handle the `target` parameter as intended, it is considered incorrect.
