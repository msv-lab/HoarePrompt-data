Final: **False**

Reason: Although the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array when the array has at least two elements, the original assessment does not account for the case where the array has fewer than two elements. According to the output hints, if the list `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function will return `float('inf')` without any explicit handling of such cases. This means the function does not accurately reflect the problem description, which should ideally handle the scenario where the array size is less than the required minimum. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be maintained, and the program's correctness should be considered false.
