Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. While the function does correctly compute the minimum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array, it fails to address the case where the input array contains fewer than two elements. According to the annotated version, if the list `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function will still attempt to calculate the difference, which would result in `min_diff` being set to `float('inf')`. This means that for an array with less than two elements, the function will return `float('inf')` instead of an appropriate error message or value indicating that the input was invalid for the intended operation. Since the problem description implies that the function should handle such cases appropriately, the current implementation does not fully meet the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this oversight.
