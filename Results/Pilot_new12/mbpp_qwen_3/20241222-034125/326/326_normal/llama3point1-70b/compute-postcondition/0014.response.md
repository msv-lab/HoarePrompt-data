Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is an integer. If `diff` (the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`) is less than `min_diff` (the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`), then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
