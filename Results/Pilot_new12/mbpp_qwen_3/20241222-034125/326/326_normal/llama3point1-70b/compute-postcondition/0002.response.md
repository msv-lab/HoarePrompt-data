According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop iterates over pairs of adjacent elements in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least two elements in the list because the loop runs from `i` to `len(arr) - 1`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs from `i` to `len(arr) - 1`, meaning `i` should start from 0 and go up to `len(arr) - 2`.
2. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, as the loop stops when `i` reaches `len(arr) - 2`.
3. The initial value of `i` is 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that the loop can start and execute properly. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`**
