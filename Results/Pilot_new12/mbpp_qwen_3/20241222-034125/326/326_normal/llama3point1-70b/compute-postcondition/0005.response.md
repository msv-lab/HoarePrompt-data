The code `min_diff = diff` updates the value of `min_diff` to the current value of `diff`. Given that `diff < min_diff` is true, it means that `diff` is already smaller than the current `min_diff`, so updating `min_diff` to `diff` will keep `min_diff` as the smallest difference found so far. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `target`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the new minimum difference which is equal to `diff`.**
