The code calculates the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `diff`. Since `arr` is in non-decreasing order, the difference between any two consecutive elements is non-negative. However, the code does not update `min_diff` directly here; it only computes `diff`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.

The line of code `diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])` calculates the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, which is `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` because `i` is 1.

Since the exact values of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` are not provided, let's denote them as `a` and `b` respectively. Therefore, `diff` is calculated as `abs(a - b)`.

The output state includes the following updates:
- `diff` is set to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `target`, `min_diff`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`**.
