The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Given that `diff` is defined as `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `min_diff` will now hold this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`**
