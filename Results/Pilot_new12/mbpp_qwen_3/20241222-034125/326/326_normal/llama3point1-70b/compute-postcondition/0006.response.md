Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements. `i` is 0, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If a new minimum difference is found during the execution of the if statement, `min_diff` is updated to this new value.***
