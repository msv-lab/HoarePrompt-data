The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is defined as the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`, `min_diff` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`**
