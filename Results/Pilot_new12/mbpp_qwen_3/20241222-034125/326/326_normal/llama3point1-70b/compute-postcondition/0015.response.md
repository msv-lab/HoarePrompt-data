Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(arr) - 2`. This means that the loop will iterate through each pair of consecutive elements in the list `arr`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be the last index where the comparison was made, which is `len(arr) - 2`.
- The variable `min_diff` will store the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the list `arr`.

Since the loop iterates through all pairs of consecutive elements in the list, `min_diff` will contain the minimum difference found during the entire process.
