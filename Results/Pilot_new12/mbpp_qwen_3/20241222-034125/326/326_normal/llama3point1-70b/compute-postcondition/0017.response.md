The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, which is an integer. The function calculates the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.**
