Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. After executing the if statement, if `diff < min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. If `diff >= min_diff`, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
