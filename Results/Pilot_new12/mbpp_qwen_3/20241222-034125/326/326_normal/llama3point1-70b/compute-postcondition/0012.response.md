The code calculates the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order, `arr[i]` is the third element (since `i` is 2) and `arr[i + 1]` is the fourth element. However, since the specific values of the list elements are not provided, we denote `arr[i]` as `arr[2]` and `arr[i + 1]` as `arr[3]`. The variable `diff` is assigned this difference.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`**
