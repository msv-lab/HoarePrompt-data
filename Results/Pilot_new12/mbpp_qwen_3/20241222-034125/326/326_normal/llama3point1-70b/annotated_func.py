        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers in non-decreasing order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference found between any two consecutive elements in arr
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr` in non-decreasing order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this minimum difference. If the list `arr` contains fewer than two elements, the function will still attempt to calculate the difference, which would result in `None` being assigned to `min_diff` (since the initial value of `min_diff` is `float('inf')`). However, this case is not explicitly handled in the code, so the function will return `float('inf')` as the minimum difference. The overall purpose of the function is to find the smallest gap between any two consecutive numbers in the given list `arr`.
