Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of each element in the list (`lst`) within the given tuple (`tup`). The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each element in `lst` and sums up the counts of those elements that exist in `tup`. The function handles the case where an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup` by ignoring it, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the function does not modify either `tup` or `lst`, and it correctly returns 0 for empty inputs, which are valid based on the assumption that inputs are always valid. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
