Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs. It returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also exists in `tup`. This is achieved through the use of a generator expression inside the `sum()` function, which iterates over each element in `lst` and adds the count of that element in `lst` (if it exists in `tup`) to the sum. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:
- For each element in `lst`, the line `tup.count(element)` checks if the element is present in `tup` and returns its count.
- These counts are then summed up using `sum()`.
- If an element in `lst` is not found in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` returns 0, which does not affect the sum.
- The function handles empty `tup` or `lst` correctly, returning 0 as per the problem description.

Thus, the program accurately performs the required operation without any deviation from the problem description.
