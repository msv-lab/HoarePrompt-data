Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the function `func_1` now correctly counts the occurrences of elements in `lst` that are present in `tup`. The revised function filters out elements in `lst` that do not exist in `tup` before counting, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function only considers elements present in `tup`, making the original assessment incorrect. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
