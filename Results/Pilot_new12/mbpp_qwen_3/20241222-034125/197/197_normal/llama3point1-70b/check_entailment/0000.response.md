Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of each element in the list within the given tuple. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple. This approach works for all potential cases without any issues. Since the function accurately implements the required functionality for any given tuple and list, the program is correct.
