Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, it does not filter out elements in `lst` that are not present in `tup`, leading to incorrect results. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue, stating that the function does not handle cases where elements in `lst` are not present in `tup`. The annotated version supports this by indicating that the function will attempt to count these non-existent elements, resulting in incorrect sums. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
