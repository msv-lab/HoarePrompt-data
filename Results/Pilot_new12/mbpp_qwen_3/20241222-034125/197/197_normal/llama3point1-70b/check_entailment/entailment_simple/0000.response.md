Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should count the occurrence of all elements of a list (`lst`) within a tuple (`tup`). However, the current implementation only returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also exists in `tup`. It does not account for the occurrences of elements in `lst` that do not exist in `tup`.

To correctly implement the function as per the problem description, the function should return a dictionary or a similar structure where each key is an element from `lst` and the value is the count of that element in `tup`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each element in lst within tup
    count_dict = {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
    return count_dict
```

This corrected function will ensure that the output accurately reflects the count of each element in `lst` that exists in `tup`, which aligns with the problem description.
