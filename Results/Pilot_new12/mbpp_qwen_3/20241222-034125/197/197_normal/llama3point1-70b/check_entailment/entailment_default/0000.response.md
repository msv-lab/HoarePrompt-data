Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also exists in `tup`. The code iterates over each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method to determine how many times each element appears in `tup`. It then sums these counts, effectively meeting the requirement to count the occurrence of all elements of `lst` in `tup`. The code handles potential edge cases such as empty tuples or lists by returning 0, as the `sum` function with an empty generator expression evaluates to 0. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem.
