Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. Instead, it attempts to count how many times each element of `lst` appears in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`, which is incorrect because `tup.count(element)` returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`, not in `lst`. To meet the problem description, the code should count the occurrences of each element from `lst` within `tup`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst if element in tup))
```

This version ensures that only elements present in `tup` are counted, addressing the issue with the original implementation.
