Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrence of elements in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`, but it does so without filtering out elements that are not present in `tup`. As a result, the function will incorrectly count elements that do not exist in the tuple, leading to incorrect results. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function currently sums the counts of all elements in `lst` within `tup`, regardless of whether they are present or not. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
