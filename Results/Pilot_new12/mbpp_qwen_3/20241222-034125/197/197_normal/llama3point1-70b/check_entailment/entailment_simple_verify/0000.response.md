Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of each element in the list (`lst`) within the given tuple (`tup`). The generator expression inside the `sum` function iterates over each element in `lst` and counts its occurrences in `tup`. This approach works for all potential cases without any issues. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the program.
