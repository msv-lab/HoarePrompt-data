Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle tuples containing elements that are not present in the list `lst`. According to the problem description, the function should count the occurrences of all elements in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, the current implementation uses a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` which will attempt to count each element in `lst`, even if those elements are not present in `tup`.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `tup = (1, 2, 3)`
- `lst = [1, 4]`

The function will still attempt to count `4` in the tuple, which will result in `0` because `4` is not in `tup`. Therefore, the sum will be `1 + 0 = 1`, but the expected output should be `1` for the element `1` and `0` for the element `4`, resulting in a total count of `1`.

To fix this, the function should only count elements that are actually present in the tuple. A corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst if element in tup))
```

This version ensures that only elements present in the tuple are counted, making the function meet the requirements of the problem description.
