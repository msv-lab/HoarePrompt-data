Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also exists in `tup`. Specifically, for each element in `lst`, if the element is found in `tup`, its count in `lst` is added to the sum. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, it is ignored. Potential edge cases include empty `tup` or `lst`, where the function would return 0. The function does not modify either `tup` or `lst`.**
