The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup` and returns this count as an integer. The function handles all elements in `elements`, even if some elements are not present in `tup`, by counting their occurrences as zero. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond this general behavior.
