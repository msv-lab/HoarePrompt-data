Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, handling all elements in `elements` and counting their occurrences as zero if they are not present in `tup`. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness for the given test cases. Therefore, there is no indication from the output hints or the code itself that the function is incorrect based on the problem description.
