Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the given tuple. The annotations support this by indicating that `tup` is a tuple and `elements` is a list of elements to count within the tuple. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `elements` and sum up their counts in `tup` using the `count` method. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is justified.
