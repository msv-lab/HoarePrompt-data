Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of all elements specified in the `elements` list within the given `tup` tuple. Here's why:

1. The function takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`.
2. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to count the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.
3. The sum of these counts is returned as the result.
4. The provided assertions verify that the function works as expected for different inputs, covering multiple elements in the tuple, some of which may appear more than once, and some of which may not be present at all.
5. The function handles all elements in `elements`, counting their occurrences as zero if they are not found in `tup`.

Since the function meets the requirements described in the problem statement for all possible valid inputs, the program is correct.
