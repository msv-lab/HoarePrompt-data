Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly count the occurrences of elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The issue lies in the usage of `tup.count(element)` inside the generator expression. This method counts the occurrences of each element in the entire tuple, which might not accurately reflect the count of those elements that appear multiple times at different positions within the tuple.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), [1, 2]) == 4
```

In this case, the expected output is 4 because there are two occurrences of 1 and two occurrences of 2 in the tuple. However, the current implementation would count each occurrence of 1 and 2 only once, resulting in an incorrect count of 2.

To fix this, you could iterate over the tuple and manually count the occurrences of each element specified in the list `elements`:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = 0
    for element in elements:
        count += tup.count(element)
    return count
```

This revised implementation correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the tuple, ensuring the function works as intended for all potential cases.
