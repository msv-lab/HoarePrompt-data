Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as inputs and counts the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element and returns the total count. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or examples provided that would cause the function to fail, and the code handles all elements in `elements`, even if some elements are not present in `tup`, by counting their occurrences as zero. Thus, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
