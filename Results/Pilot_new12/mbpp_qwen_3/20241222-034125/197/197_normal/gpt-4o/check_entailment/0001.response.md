Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the given tuple. The function iterates over each element in the list and sums up the counts of these elements in the tuple using the `count` method. The assertions provided in the problem description also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles the provided examples correctly and the logic appears sound, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work for any valid input as per the problem description.
