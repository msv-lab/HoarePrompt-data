Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the `elements` list within the given tuple `tup`. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The annotations further clarify that the function handles all elements in `elements`, counting their occurrences as zero if they are not present in `tup`. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description or annotations that would render the function incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
