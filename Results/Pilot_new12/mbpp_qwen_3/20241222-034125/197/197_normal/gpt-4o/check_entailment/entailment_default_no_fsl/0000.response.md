Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and counts the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. The `sum` function along with a generator expression iterates over each element in `elements` and adds up their counts from `tup`. The function handles cases where elements in `elements` may not be present in `tup` by counting them as zero, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the code appears to be correct for every potential case based on the given information.
