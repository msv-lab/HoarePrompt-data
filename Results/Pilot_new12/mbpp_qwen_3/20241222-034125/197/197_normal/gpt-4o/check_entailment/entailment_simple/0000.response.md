Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list).
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - Inside the function, a generator expression `tup.count(element) for element in elements` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`.
   - `tup.count(element)` returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`.
   - The `sum()` function adds up these counts to produce the total count of occurrences of the elements in `elements` within `tup`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions test the function with different inputs and expected outputs:
     - The first assertion checks the function with the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list `['a', 'b']`, expecting a result of `3` because `'a'` appears twice and `'b'` once.
     - The second assertion checks the function with the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4)` and the list `[1, 4, 7]`, expecting a result of `6` because `1` appears three times, `4` appears twice, and `7` once.
     - The third assertion checks the function with the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` and the list `[1, 2]`, expecting a result of `2` because both `1` and `2` appear once.

4. **Correctness Across All Cases**:
   - The function accurately counts the occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.
   - It handles all cases as specified in the problem description, including counting the occurrences of multiple elements in a single pass.

Since the program correctly implements the described functionality and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
