Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup` and returns this count as an integer. The function handles all elements in `elements`, even if some elements are not present in `tup`, by counting their occurrences as zero. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond this general behavior.**

This summary focuses on the actual functionality derived from the code itself, noting that the function counts occurrences of each element in the tuple, even if some elements are not present, and returns the total count.
