#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elements is a list of elements to count within the tuple.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the sum of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts the total number of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup` and returns this count as an integer. The function handles all elements in `elements`, even if some elements are not present in `tup`, by counting their occurrences as zero. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond this general behavior.
