Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list contains strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. If the input is an empty list or a list containing empty sublists, the returned list will also be empty. If the sublists contain only one element, they will remain unchanged.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `list_of_lists` is an empty list, the function returns an empty list.
- If any sublist within `list_of_lists` is empty, the corresponding sublist in the returned list will also be empty.
- If any sublist contains only one element, that sublist will remain unchanged in the returned list.

**Missing Functionality (Not Present in Annotations):**
- The annotations do not mention handling of non-string elements in the sublists, which would raise a `TypeError`. However, since the code does not check for string types, the function will attempt to sort non-string elements, leading to unexpected behavior. This should be noted as a potential issue.
