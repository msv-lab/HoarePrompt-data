#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of sorted sublists where each sublist is from the original `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), where each inner list contains strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. If the input is an empty list or a list containing empty sublists, the returned list will also be empty. If the sublists contain only one element, they will remain unchanged.
