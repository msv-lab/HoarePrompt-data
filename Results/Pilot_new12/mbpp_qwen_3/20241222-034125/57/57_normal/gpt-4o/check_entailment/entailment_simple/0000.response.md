Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, where each inner list contains strings. It then sorts each sublist and returns a new list of these sorted sublists. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:

1. The first test case sorts `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['white', 'black', 'orange']` into `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['black', 'orange', 'white']` respectively.
2. The second test case sorts `[' red ', 'green']`, `['blue ', ' black']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']` into `[' red ', 'green']`, `[' black', 'blue ']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']` respectively.
3. The third test case sorts `['zilver', 'gold']`, `['magnesium', 'aluminium']`, and `['steel', 'bronze']` into `['gold', 'zilver']`, `['aluminium', 'magnesium']`, and `['bronze', 'steel']` respectively.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort each one. This approach ensures that the function meets the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
