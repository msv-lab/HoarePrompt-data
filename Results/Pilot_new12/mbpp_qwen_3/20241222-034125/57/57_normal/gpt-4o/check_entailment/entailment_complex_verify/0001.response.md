Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function processes a list of lists where each inner list contains strings and returns a new list of sorted sublists. The examples given in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as intended, sorting the strings in each sublist in alphabetical order. The annotated version aligns with the original assessment, confirming that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified in the provided examples or general logic that would contradict the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as correct.
