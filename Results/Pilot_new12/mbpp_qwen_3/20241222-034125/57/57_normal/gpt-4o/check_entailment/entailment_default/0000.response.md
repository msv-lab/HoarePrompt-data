Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, ensuring that each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The examples provided show that the function works correctly for various inputs, including cases with multiple sublists and sublists containing different numbers of elements, as well as handling spaces in the strings.

Since the function correctly sorts each sublist as specified in the problem description for the given examples and no issues are identified based on the provided output hints, the program is considered correct.
