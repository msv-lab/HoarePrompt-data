Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, sorting each sublist while preserving the structure of the original list. There is no indication from the output hints or the provided code that the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
