Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted alphabetically. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, sorting each sublist in alphabetical order without any issues. The annotations match the behavior of the function and there are no inconsistencies or errors identified. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
