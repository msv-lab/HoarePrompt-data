Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each inner list contains strings and returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The examples provided in the assertions show that the function behaves as expected, sorting each sublist correctly. The annotated version also clarifies that the function does not modify the original `list_of_lists`, which is consistent with the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
