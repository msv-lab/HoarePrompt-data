Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The provided code and the output hints confirm that the function works as expected, sorting each sublist in alphabetical order. The function handles various scenarios such as non-empty sublists, single-element sublists, and even empty lists (resulting in an empty list of sublists). Since the provided test cases and the problem description match the behavior of the function, and there are no issues or edge cases identified, the original assessment is accurate.
