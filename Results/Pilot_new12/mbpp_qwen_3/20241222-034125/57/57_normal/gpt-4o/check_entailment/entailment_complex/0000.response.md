Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) where each inner list contains strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Sorting**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements of each sublist. The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list which is returned.

3. **No Modification of Original List**: The original `list_of_lists` is not modified; the function returns a new list with sorted sublists.

4. **Handling Valid Input**: The problem description states that the input should be a list of lists, and each inner list should contain strings. The provided implementation handles these cases correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - **Empty Sublists**: If any sublist within `list_of_lists` is empty, the `sorted()` function will return an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
   - **Single Element Sublists**: If a sublist contains only one element, the `sorted()` function will leave it unchanged.

6. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions cover various scenarios including lists with multiple sublists, different string lengths, and spaces in the strings. These test cases confirm that the function works as intended.

Given that the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles various edge cases appropriately, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is `Correctness: True`.
