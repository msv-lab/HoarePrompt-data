Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted. The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings as required by the problem description. There are no inconsistencies or issues highlighted by the annotations that would suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
