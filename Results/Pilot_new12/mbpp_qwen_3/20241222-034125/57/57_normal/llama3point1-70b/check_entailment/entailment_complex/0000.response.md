Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of lists, where each element of the inner lists is a string. This matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist. The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, meaning that strings like 'Apple' and 'apple' will be considered equal during the sorting process.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list of sorted sublists without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. This adheres to the problem description, which states that the function should not alter the original input but create and return a new list.

Since the function `func_1` correctly implements the specified behavior for all potential cases (assuming valid inputs), the program is correct according to the problem description.
