Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each element of the inner lists is a string) and returns a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. This behavior matches the problem description exactly. The annotations confirm that the function creates and returns a new list of sorted sublists without modifying the original input, which is consistent with the requirement of sorting each sublist of strings. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
