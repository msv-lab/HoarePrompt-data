Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order, ignoring case sensitivity. The output hints confirm that the function achieves this by using `sorted` with `key=str.lower`, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. Since the problem description asks for each sublist of strings to be sorted in a case-insensitive manner, and the provided function correctly implements this requirement, the original assessment is accurate and the program is correct.
