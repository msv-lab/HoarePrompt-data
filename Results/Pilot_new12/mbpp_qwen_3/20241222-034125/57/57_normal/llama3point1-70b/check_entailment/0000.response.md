Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists and sorts each sublist of strings in ascending order, ignoring the case. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The use of `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. Given any list of lists containing strings, this function will correctly sort each sublist as required. Therefore, no counterexample has been found where the program fails to meet the problem description.
