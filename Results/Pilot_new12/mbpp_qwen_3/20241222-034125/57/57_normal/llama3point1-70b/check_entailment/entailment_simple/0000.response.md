Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. 

- **Problem Description:** The problem description states that the function should sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
- **Program Implementation:** 
  - The line `return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]` iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
  - For each sublist, `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` sorts the elements using a case-insensitive key (`str.lower`). This ensures that the sorting is done in a way that is not affected by the case (uppercase or lowercase) of the characters in the strings.
  - The result is a list of sorted sublists, which matches the requirement of the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the specified behavior, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential valid case. Therefore, the program is correct.
