Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists, where each element of the inner lists is a string, and returns a new list of sorted sublists. The sorting is done in ascending order using a case-insensitive comparison (`key=str.lower`). This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The annotations confirm that the program meets the requirements by returning a list of sorted sublists where each element is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
