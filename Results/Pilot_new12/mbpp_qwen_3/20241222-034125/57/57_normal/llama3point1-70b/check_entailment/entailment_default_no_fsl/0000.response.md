Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using a case-insensitive comparison. The comprehension list iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sorts them using `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`, and returns a new list with these sorted sublists. This matches the problem description perfectly for every potential case, as it handles sorting each sublist while ignoring case sensitivity, and it does not modify the original list, which is also consistent with the description. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that indicate the code is incorrect.
