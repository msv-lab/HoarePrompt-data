Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order, ignoring case sensitivity. This is achieved by using the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that sorting is done based on the lowercase version of the strings. Given the problem description, this implementation meets the requirements for all potential cases since it correctly sorts each sublist while maintaining case insensitivity. Therefore, no counterexample can be found where the program fails to meet the described functionality.
