Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using a case-insensitive comparison. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sorts them using `sorted()` with `key=str.lower` to ensure case-insensitive sorting, and returns a new list of these sorted sublists. This approach adheres to the problem description without any apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for valid inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
