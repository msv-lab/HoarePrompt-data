Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, ignoring case sensitivity. The annotated version confirms that the function processes a list of lists where each element is a string and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order using a case-insensitive comparison. Since the problem description matches the implementation and the annotations confirm the expected behavior, the program meets the requirements.
