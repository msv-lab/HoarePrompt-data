Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in ascending order, ignoring the case, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted case-insensitively. Since the function does not modify the original list of lists and produces the correct sorted sublists, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
