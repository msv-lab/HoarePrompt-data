Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, as specified in the problem description. The annotated version correctly describes the state and behavior of the program, confirming that it meets the required functionality without any counterexamples or issues identified. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
