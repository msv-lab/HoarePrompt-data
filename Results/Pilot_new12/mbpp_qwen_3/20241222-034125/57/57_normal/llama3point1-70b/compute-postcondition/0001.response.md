The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element of the inner lists is a string. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of sorted sublists where each element within the sublists is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists of strings and return a new list of sorted sublists based on case-insensitive comparison.
