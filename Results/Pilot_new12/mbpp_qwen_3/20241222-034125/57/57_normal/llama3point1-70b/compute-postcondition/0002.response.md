Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. This means that strings like 'Apple' and 'apple' will be considered equal during sorting. The function does not modify the original `list_of_lists`; instead, it creates and returns a new list with the sorted sublists.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If any of the inner lists in `list_of_lists` are empty, they will still be included in the returned list but will remain empty.
- If any of the inner lists contain non-string elements, the code will raise a `TypeError` because `str.lower` cannot be applied to non-string types.

**Missing Functionality (if any):**
- The provided code does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` itself is `None`. In such a scenario, the function would raise a `TypeError` when attempting to iterate over `list_of_lists`. To handle this, one could add a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty list if `list_of_lists` is `None`.

**Final State of the Program:**
After the function concludes, the program will have a new list of sorted sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. The original `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.
