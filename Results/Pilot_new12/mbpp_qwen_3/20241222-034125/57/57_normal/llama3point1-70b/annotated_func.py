#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element of the inner lists is a string.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of sorted sublists where each element is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. This means that strings like 'Apple' and 'apple' will be considered equal during sorting. The function does not modify the original `list_of_lists`; instead, it creates and returns a new list with the sorted sublists.
