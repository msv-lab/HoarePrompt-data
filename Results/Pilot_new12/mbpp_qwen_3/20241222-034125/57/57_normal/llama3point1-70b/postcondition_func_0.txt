The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each inner list is sorted in ascending order using case-insensitive comparison. This means that strings like 'Apple' and 'apple' will be considered equal during sorting. The function does not modify the original `list_of_lists`; instead, it creates and returns a new list with the sorted sublists.
