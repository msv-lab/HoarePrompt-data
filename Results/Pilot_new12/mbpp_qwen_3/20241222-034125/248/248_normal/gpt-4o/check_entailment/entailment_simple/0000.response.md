Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements from that list. The annotations in the program demonstrate this functionality with three test cases:

1. `func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3])` returns `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
2. `func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7])` returns `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`.
3. `func_1([58, 44, 56])` returns `(58, 44, 56)`.

The function `func_1` correctly converts each list into a tuple and returns it. Since the problem description simply requires the function to convert a list to a tuple, and the provided implementation satisfies this requirement, the program is correct.
