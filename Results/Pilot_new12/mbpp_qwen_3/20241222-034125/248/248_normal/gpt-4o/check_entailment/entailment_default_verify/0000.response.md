Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described. The output hints confirm that the function simply takes a list, converts it to a tuple, and returns it without modifying the original list. All provided assertions pass, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned that would indicate the function is incorrect. Thus, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
