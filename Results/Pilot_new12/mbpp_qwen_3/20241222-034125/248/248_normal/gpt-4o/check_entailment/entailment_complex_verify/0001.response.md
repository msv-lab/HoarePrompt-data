Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The annotations support this by clearly stating that the function accepts a list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The annotations also mention that the function does not modify the original list, which is consistent with the behavior demonstrated in the provided test cases. Since the function works as expected for the given test cases and there are no conditional logic or edge cases mentioned that would cause issues, the program is correct.
