Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as per the problem description. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The output hints also align with this understanding, stating that the function simply creates a new tuple from the list elements without modifying the original list. Since there are no edge cases or issues mentioned that would affect the correctness of the function, and the provided test cases validate its functionality, the program is correct.
