Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function does not perform any modifications to the original list and simply converts it to a tuple. The examples provided in the assertions also correctly demonstrate this behavior. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
