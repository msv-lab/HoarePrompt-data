Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The function correctly uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list to a tuple. The assertions in the code test the function with different lists, and the function passes all these tests. Since the function behaves as expected for the given examples and there are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling, the code appears to be correct for every potential case under the given assumptions.
