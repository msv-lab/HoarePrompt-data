Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list as input (`lst`) and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires a function to convert a list to a tuple. The provided assertions in the annotated version also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Since the function uses the built-in `tuple` function, which performs the conversion correctly, and the provided test cases show that the function works as intended, the program is correct.
