Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple` function, which takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple containing the same elements. All the provided test cases demonstrate this behavior:

1. `assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`
2. `assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
3. `assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)`

Since the function works as expected for the given test cases and the conversion from a list to a tuple is a straightforward operation with no conditional logic, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any list input. Therefore, the program is correct.
