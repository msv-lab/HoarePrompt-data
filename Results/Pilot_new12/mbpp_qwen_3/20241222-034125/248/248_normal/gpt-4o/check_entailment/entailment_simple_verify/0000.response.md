Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version supports this by clearly stating that the function takes a list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. Since the provided code meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations confirm this behavior, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
