Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The annotated version further clarifies that the function takes a list as input, converts it to a tuple, and returns the tuple without modifying the original list. Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the annotations do not indicate any issues or edge cases, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
