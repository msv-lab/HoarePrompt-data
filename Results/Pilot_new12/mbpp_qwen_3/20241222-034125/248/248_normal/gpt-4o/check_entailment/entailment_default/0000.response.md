Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The assertions in the code verify that the function works as expected for different input lists. Since the function handles all provided test cases and the problem description simply requires converting a list to a tuple, the function meets the requirements for every potential case given the assumption of valid input.
