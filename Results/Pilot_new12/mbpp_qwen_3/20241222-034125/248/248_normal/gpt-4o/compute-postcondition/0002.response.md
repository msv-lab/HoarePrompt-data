Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The function does not modify the original list; instead, it creates a new tuple from the list elements. This means that the input list remains unchanged after the function execution. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling, as the function simply converts a list to a tuple without any additional operations.**

**Final state of the program after conclusion:** The function returns a tuple containing all elements from the list `lst`, and the original list `lst` remains unchanged.
