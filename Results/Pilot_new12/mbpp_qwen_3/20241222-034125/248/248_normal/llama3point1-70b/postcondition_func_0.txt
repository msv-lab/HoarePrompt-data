The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list. It converts the entire list into a tuple and returns this tuple. The function ensures that all elements from the input list are included in the returned tuple. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling. The function simply converts a list to a tuple and returns it, preserving all elements from the original list.
