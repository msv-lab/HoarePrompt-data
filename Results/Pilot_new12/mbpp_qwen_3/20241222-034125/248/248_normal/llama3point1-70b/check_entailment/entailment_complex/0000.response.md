Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list. It then converts this list into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and returns the resulting tuple. The function preserves all elements from the original list in the returned tuple. Since the problem description simply requires converting a list to a tuple, and the function does exactly that without any additional conditions or edge cases, the program is correct.
