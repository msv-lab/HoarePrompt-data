Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirement of converting a list to a tuple. The provided output hints confirm that the function simply converts the input list into a tuple and returns it, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function behaves incorrectly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
