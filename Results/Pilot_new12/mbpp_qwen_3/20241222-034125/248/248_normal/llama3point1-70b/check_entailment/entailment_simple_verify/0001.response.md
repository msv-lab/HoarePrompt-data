Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This perfectly aligns with the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. There is no evidence in the annotations suggesting that the program behaves incorrectly or fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
