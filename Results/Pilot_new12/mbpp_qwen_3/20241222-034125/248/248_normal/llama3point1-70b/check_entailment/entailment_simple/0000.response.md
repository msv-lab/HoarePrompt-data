Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `input_list` as an argument and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should convert a list to a tuple. Since the function performs this conversion correctly and the problem description does not include any additional constraints or edge cases that need to be handled (such as non-list inputs), the program is correct according to the given problem description.
