Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. Given the problem description to write a function that converts a list to a tuple, the function `func_1` accomplishes this task by using the built-in `tuple()` function, which converts the input list into a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function converts the entire list into a tuple and includes all elements from the original list. There are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, and the code works as expected for any valid list input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
