Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple for any input list. The Python built-in `tuple()` function is used to achieve this, which works for any iterable, including lists. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
