Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns it as a tuple. Given the problem description to convert a list to a tuple, the function `func_1` does exactly that. The output hints confirm that the function works correctly for converting the entire list into a tuple without omitting any elements. Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases beyond valid list inputs, and the provided function handles those inputs correctly, the function is correct for every potential case.
