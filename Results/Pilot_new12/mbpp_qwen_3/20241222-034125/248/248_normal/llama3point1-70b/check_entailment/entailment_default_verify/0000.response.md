Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` converts a list to a tuple using the Python built-in `tuple()` function. The output hints confirm that the function takes a list as input, converts it to a tuple, and returns the tuple. Since the problem description requires the function to convert a list to a tuple, and the provided code fulfills this requirement without any issues or edge cases that would cause failure, the original assessment is accurate. The output hints further validate that the function behaves as intended, converting the list to a tuple and returning it, which aligns with the problem description.
