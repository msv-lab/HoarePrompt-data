The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers present in the list. It achieves this by first converting the list to a set to eliminate duplicates and then calculating the sum of the elements in the set. This function handles the case where the list might contain duplicate integers, ensuring that each integer is counted only once in the final sum. An empty list will result in a sum of 0, and if the list contains no integers, the same result is obtained.
