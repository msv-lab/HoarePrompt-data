Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `sum(set(lst))` to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicates, and then summing the set gives the sum of unique elements. 

Given the examples:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns `21`, which is the sum of `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6`.
2. `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns `71`, which is the sum of `1 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 2 + 45 + 4`.
3. `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns `78`, which is the sum of `12 + 10 + 9 + 45 + 2`.

In each of these cases, the function correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements. Additionally, this method will handle any potential input, including lists with large numbers of duplicates or negative numbers, as it only sums unique elements. Since no counterexample was found where the program does not meet the requirements, the function is considered correct.
