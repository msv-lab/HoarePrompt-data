Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version supports this assessment by clearly explaining that the function `func_1` converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the sum of the unique elements. This method correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements for the given test cases. The annotated version also mentions that the function handles the case where the list might contain duplicate integers and ensures that each integer is counted only once in the final sum. Given that the provided test cases and the logic of the function align with the problem description, the program is correct.
