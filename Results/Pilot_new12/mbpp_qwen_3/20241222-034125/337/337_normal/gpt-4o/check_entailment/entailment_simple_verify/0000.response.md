Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program uses `sum(set(lst))` to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. However, this approach fails for lists containing negative numbers or zero because the `set` function treats them as distinct elements. For instance, if the input list is `[-1, 1, -1, 2]`, the set would be `{-1, 1, 2}`, and the sum would be `2`, which is incorrect. The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2`. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, maintaining the original assessment of its incorrectness.
