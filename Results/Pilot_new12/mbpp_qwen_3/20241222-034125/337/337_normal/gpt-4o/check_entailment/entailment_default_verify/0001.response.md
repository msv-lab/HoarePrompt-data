Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by converting the list to a set to remove duplicates and then summing the elements of the set. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected and the output hints confirm that the function handles the specified functionality correctly. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
