Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. This is achieved by converting the list to a set (`set(lst)`), which automatically removes duplicate elements, and then using the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the unique elements. 

The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` should return `21` (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21).
- `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` should return `71` (1 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 2 + 45 + 4 = 71).
- `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` should return `78` (12 + 9 + 45 + 2 + 10 + 45 = 78).

Since the program consistently calculates the sum of unique elements in the list, it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
