Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by converting the list to a set to remove duplicates and then summing the unique elements. The function works for all potential cases as per the problem description and the examples given:

1. The function handles lists with duplicate elements and sums only the unique ones.
2. The function returns the correct sum for the provided test cases.
3. The function works for empty lists, returning a sum of 0, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the function correctly implements the required functionality for all given examples and potential cases, the program is correct.
