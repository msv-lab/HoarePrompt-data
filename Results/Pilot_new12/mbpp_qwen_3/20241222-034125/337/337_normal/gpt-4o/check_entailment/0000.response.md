Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `sum(set(lst))` to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. However, this approach will fail for lists containing negative numbers or zero because the `set` function will treat `-1` and `1` as different elements, and similarly, `0` will be treated as a separate element. For example:

- If the input list is `[-1, 1, -1, 2]`, the set would be `{-1, 1, 2}`, and the sum would be `2`, which is incorrect. The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and hence the correctness is **False**.
