Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The problem description specifies that the function should accept a list of integers, and the provided function does exactly that.

2. **Sum of Unique Elements**: The function converts the list to a set using `set(lst)`. By definition, a set contains unique elements only. Thus, converting the list to a set removes all duplicates. The function then calculates the sum of these unique elements using `sum(set(lst))`. This ensures that each element is counted only once, which aligns with the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements.

3. **Handling Empty Lists**: If the input list is empty, converting it to a set results in an empty set, and `sum(set(lst))` will return 0, as there are no elements to sum. This behavior matches the expected outcome for an empty list.

4. **General Case**: For any valid list of integers, the function correctly computes the sum of the unique elements without including duplicates.

Since the function correctly implements the described functionality and adheres to the problem description, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is `Correctness: True`.
