Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. The annotated version supports this by clearly stating that the program returns the sum of unique integers in the list `lst`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected, summing up the unique elements in each list. Therefore, there is no discrepancy between the original assessment and the annotated version of the code.
