#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers, and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`. For each integer, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is exactly one (indicating uniqueness). The function sums up all such unique integers. Potential edge cases include empty lists, where the function returns 0, and lists with no unique elements, also resulting in a return value of 0. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.
