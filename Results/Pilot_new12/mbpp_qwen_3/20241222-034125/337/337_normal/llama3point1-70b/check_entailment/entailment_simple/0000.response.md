Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The problem description specifies that the input should be a list, and we are assuming the input is valid.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function uses a generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
   - It filters out elements that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`. This ensures that only non-repeated (unique) elements are considered.
   - The `sum()` function is then used to compute the sum of these filtered elements.

3. **Output**: The function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.

Since the function accurately implements the logic required to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list, it meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
