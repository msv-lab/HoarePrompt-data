Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`. For each integer, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is exactly one, indicating that the element is unique. The function then sums up all such unique integers. This approach ensures that only non-repeated elements are considered in the summation, meeting the requirements of the problem description.

The program handles potential edge cases appropriately, such as when the list is empty (`return 0`) or contains no unique elements (`return 0`). Given the assumption that the input will be valid, these edge cases are handled as expected without causing errors. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
