Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The logic of using `lst.count(i) == 1` inside the generator expression ensures that only elements appearing exactly once in the list are considered for the sum. There are no contradictions or issues revealed by the annotated version that would alter the original assessment of the program's correctness.
