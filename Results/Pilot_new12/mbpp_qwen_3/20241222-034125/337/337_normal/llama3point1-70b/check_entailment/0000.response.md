Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any list, the program iterates through each element and uses `lst.count(i) == 1` to check if the element appears exactly once in the list. If it does, the element is included in the sum. This logic ensures that only non-repeated elements contribute to the final sum. Given the nature of the problem and the provided solution, there doesn't seem to be any edge case or input that would cause this program to fail according to the problem description.
