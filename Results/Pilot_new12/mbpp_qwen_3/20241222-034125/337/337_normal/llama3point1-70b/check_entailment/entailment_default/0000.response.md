Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`. For each integer, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is exactly one (indicating uniqueness). The function sums up all such unique integers. The code handles edge cases such as empty lists, returning 0, and lists with no unique elements, also resulting in a return value of 0. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and it correctly implements the described behavior for every potential case.
