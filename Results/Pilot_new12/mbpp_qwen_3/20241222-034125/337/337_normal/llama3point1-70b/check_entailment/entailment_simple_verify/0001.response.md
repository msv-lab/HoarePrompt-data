Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`lst`), and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. The generator expression inside the `sum()` function filters out elements that appear more than once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`). This ensures that only non-repeated elements are considered in the sum, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and the original assessment is correct.
