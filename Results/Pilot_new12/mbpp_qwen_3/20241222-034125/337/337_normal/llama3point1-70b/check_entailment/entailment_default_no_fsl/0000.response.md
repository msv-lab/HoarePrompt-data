Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by checking if each element appears exactly once in the list. The code handles all mentioned edge cases, such as an empty list returning 0, and lists with no unique elements also resulting in a return value of 0. The generator expression within the `sum` function iterates over each integer in the list and includes it in the sum only if its count in the list is exactly one. This approach ensures that the sum is calculated correctly for every potential case without any missing functionalities.
