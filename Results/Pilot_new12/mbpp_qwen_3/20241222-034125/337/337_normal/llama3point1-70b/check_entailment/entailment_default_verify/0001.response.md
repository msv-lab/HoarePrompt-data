Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The generator expression filters out elements that appear only once in the list, and the `sum()` function adds these unique elements together. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling edge cases like empty lists or lists with no unique elements appropriately by returning 0. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
