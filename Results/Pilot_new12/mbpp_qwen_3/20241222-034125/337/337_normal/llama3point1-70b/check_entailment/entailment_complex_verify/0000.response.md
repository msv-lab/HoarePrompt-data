Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotated version clarifies that the function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each integer in the list, checking if the count of each integer is exactly one. This ensures that only non-repeated elements are included in the sum. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists by returning 0, and lists with no unique elements also result in a return value of 0. There are no missing functionalities or logical errors in the provided code that would contradict the problem description or the annotated version. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
