Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotations confirm that the function iterates over each integer in the list `lst`, filters out those that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and sums up the remaining unique integers. The function handles edge cases appropriately, such as returning 0 for empty lists or lists with no unique elements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
