Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to filter out elements that appear only once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`) and then sums them up using the `sum()` function. This approach ensures that each element is counted only once, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
