Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each element in the list, checks if it appears exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and sums up all such unique integers. The potential edge cases mentioned (empty lists and lists with no unique elements) are handled correctly, returning 0 in these scenarios. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
