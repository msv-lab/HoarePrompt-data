The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the converted `tpl` to a list. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, convert the tuple to a list, and return the concatenation of the two lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts `tpl` to a list, and returns the concatenation of `lst` and the converted `tpl`.**
