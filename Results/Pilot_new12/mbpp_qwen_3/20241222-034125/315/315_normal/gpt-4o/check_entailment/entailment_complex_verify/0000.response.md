Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description of adding the elements of a given tuple to the end of a given list. The annotations confirm that the function converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list, creating a new list that contains all elements from the original list followed by all elements from the tuple. The test cases provided in the annotations cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. Since the function does not modify the original lists or tuples and handles the input correctly according to the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
