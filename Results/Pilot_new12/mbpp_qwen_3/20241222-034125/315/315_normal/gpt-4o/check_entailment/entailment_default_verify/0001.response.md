Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly concatenates the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then adding it to the original list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, concatenating the elements of the tuple to the end of the list without modifying the original inputs. The function does not encounter any logical flaws or edge cases that would render it incorrect based on the problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
