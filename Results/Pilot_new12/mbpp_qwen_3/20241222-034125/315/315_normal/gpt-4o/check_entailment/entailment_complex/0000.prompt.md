You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #`The program returns a list that is the concatenation of lst and the converted tuple tpl to a list`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list, then concatenates this list with `lst`. The function returns a new list that is the result of this concatenation. This process covers all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from the converted `tpl`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that require special handling; however, it is assumed that `lst` can contain any type of elements and `tpl` can contain any number of elements. The function does not modify the original `lst` or `tpl`; instead, it creates and returns a new list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
