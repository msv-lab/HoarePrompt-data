Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. The examples and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since the problem description only requires adding a tuple to a list without any additional constraints or edge cases specified, and the function satisfies this requirement for the given inputs, the code is correct for every potential case within the given assumptions.
