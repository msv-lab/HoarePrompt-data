Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. The provided output hints also confirm this behavior. Since the function handles the concatenation as expected and there are no edge cases mentioned that would invalidate its correctness, the program is indeed correct.
