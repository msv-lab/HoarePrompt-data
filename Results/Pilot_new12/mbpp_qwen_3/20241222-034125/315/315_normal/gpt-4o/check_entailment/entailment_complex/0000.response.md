Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple `tpl` into a list, and then concatenates it with `lst`. The resulting list is returned, which includes all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from the converted `tpl`. 

The assertions provided in the comments confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. When called with `[5, 6, 7]` and `(9, 10)`, the function returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. When called with `[6, 7, 8]` and `(10, 11)`, the function returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. When called with `[7, 8, 9]` and `(11, 12)`, the function returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and the provided examples confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
