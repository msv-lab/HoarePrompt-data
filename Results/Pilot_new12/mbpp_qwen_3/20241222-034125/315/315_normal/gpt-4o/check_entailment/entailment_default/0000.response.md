Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it with the given list. The assertions in the code demonstrate that the function works correctly for the provided examples. Since the function handles the conversion of the tuple to a list and concatenation with the given list, it satisfies the problem description without any issues. There are no edge cases or specific scenarios mentioned in the output hints that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
