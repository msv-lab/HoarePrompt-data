Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple converted to a list. 

The program uses the following steps to achieve this:
1. It converts the tuple `tpl` to a list using `list(tpl)`.
2. It concatenates the original list `lst` with the newly created list from `tpl` using the `+` operator.

The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate the expected behavior:
- The first assertion checks that `[5, 6, 7] + [9, 10]` results in `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
- The second assertion checks that `[6, 7, 8] + [10, 11]` results in `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
- The third assertion checks that `[7, 8, 9] + [11, 12]` results in `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function correctly concatenates the list and the tuple (converted to a list), and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct according to the problem description.
