#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #`The program returns a list that is the concatenation of lst and the converted tuple tpl to a list`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list, then concatenates this list with `lst`. The function returns a new list that is the result of this concatenation. This process covers all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from the converted `tpl`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that require special handling; however, it is assumed that `lst` can contain any type of elements and `tpl` can contain any number of elements. The function does not modify the original `lst` or `tpl`; instead, it creates and returns a new list.
