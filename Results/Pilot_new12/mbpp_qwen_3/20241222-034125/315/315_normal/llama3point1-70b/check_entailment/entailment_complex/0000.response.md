Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function converts the tuple into a list using `list(input_tuple)` and then concatenates this list with the original `input_list` using the `+` operator. This results in a new list that contains all the elements from both the original list and the converted tuple.

The provided code handles the general case where both inputs are valid and does not require additional handling for edge cases like empty lists or tuples, as these are already covered by the behavior of the `+` operator in Python. When `input_tuple` is empty, the function returns the original `input_list` without any changes. Similarly, when `input_list` is empty, the function returns the converted `input_tuple`.

Since the function performs exactly as described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
