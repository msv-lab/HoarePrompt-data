Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a new list containing all elements of the original list followed by the elements of the tuple, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no missing functionalities or logical errors indicated by the annotations, and the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs.
