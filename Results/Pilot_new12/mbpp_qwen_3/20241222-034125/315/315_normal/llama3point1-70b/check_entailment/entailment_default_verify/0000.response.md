Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list. The output hints confirm that the function handles all elements of both the input list and the tuple, including edge cases where either the list or the tuple is empty. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is justified.
