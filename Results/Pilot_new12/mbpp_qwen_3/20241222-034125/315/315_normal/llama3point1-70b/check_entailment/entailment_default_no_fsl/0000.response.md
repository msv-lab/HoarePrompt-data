Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, converts the tuple into a list, and concatenates it with the original list. This approach works for all potential cases, including when either the list or the tuple is empty. The output hints confirm that the function handles these cases correctly by simply returning the non-empty collection. Therefore, the function satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
