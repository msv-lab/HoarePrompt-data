Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function then converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator. This operation results in a new list that contains all elements from `input_list` followed by all elements from `input_tuple`. 

The function correctly performs the task of adding the given tuple to the given list as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
