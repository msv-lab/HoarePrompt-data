Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple (to a list). This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. Since tuples can be easily converted to lists using the `list()` function, and list concatenation works as expected, the function will work for any valid input list and tuple. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
