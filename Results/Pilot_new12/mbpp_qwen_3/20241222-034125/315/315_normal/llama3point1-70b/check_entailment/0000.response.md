Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that contains the elements of the original list followed by the elements of the tuple. This exactly matches the problem description of adding the given tuple to the given list. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (as converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list is straightforward), the program is correct.
