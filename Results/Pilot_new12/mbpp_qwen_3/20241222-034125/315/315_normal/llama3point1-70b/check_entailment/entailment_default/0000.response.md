Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The function `func_1` meets the problem description for every potential case:

- If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are non-empty, the function correctly returns a new list containing all elements from both.
- If `input_list` is empty, the function returns a list that is just the converted `input_tuple`.
- If `input_tuple` is empty, the function returns a list that is just the original `input_list`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as described, the program is correct.
