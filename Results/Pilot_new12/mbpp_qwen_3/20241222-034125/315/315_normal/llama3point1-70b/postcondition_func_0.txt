The function `func_1` accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`. It converts the tuple into a list and then concatenates this list with the original `input_list`, returning a new list that is the result of this concatenation. This process covers all elements of both the input list and the converted tuple. Potential edge cases include scenarios where either `input_list` or `input_tuple` is empty; in such cases, the returned list will simply be the non-empty collection. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
