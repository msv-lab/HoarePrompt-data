Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base length of a triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of a prism, respectively. The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). This formula correctly computes the area of the triangular base \((b * h / 2)\) and then multiplies it by the length of the prism `l` to obtain the volume. Since the problem description does not specify handling edge cases such as invalid inputs, and we are assuming valid inputs, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
