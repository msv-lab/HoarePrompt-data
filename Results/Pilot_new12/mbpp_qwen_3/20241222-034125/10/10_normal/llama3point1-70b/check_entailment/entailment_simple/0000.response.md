Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

In the program, `b` represents the base length of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism. The function `func_1(b, h, l)` computes:

\[ V = \left( \frac{b \times h}{2} \right) \times l \]

This matches the formula for the volume of a triangular prism exactly. Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description and is correct.
