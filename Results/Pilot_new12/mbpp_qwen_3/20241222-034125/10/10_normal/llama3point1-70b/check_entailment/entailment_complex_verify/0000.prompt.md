You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correct according to the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism). The formula used is mathematically sound and should work for any valid inputs that represent the dimensions of a triangular prism. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail for any valid input.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is the base length of the triangle, h is the height of the triangle, and l is the length of the prism, all represented as positive real numbers.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns (b * h / 2) * l, where 'b' is the base length of the triangle, 'h' is the height of the triangle, and 'l' is the length of the prism
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base length of a triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of a prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). This formula computes the area of the triangular base \((b * h / 2)\) and then multiplies it by the length of the prism `l` to get the volume. The function assumes that all inputs are positive real numbers. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function, but it is expected that the inputs should be valid (positive real numbers) to avoid division by zero or other arithmetic errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
