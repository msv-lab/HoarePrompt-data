Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The function `func_1` takes three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base length of the triangular base, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism, respectively. The formula used in the function matches the problem description exactly.

Since the function uses the correct formula and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases (such as non-positive values for `b`, `h`, or `l`), and assuming valid inputs as stated, the function will work correctly for every potential case.
