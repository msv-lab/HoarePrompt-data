Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \((\text{base} \times \text{height} / 2) \times \text{length}\). Given the problem description and the output hints, the function assumes that all inputs (`b`, `h`, and `l`) are positive real numbers. The function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs, but the instructions state that we should assume valid inputs. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential valid case as described.
