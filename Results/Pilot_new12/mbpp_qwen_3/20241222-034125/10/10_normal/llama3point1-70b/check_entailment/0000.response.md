Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\), which is correct according to the problem description. The function takes three parameters: `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism). The formula used is mathematically sound and should work for any valid inputs that represent the dimensions of a triangular prism. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail for any valid input.
