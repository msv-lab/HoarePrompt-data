You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is the base length of the triangle, h is the height of the triangle, and l is the length of the prism, all represented as positive real numbers.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns (b * h / 2) * l, where 'b' is the base length of the triangle, 'h' is the height of the triangle, and 'l' is the length of the prism
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base length of a triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of a prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). This formula computes the area of the triangular base \((b * h / 2)\) and then multiplies it by the length of the prism `l` to get the volume. The function assumes that all inputs are positive real numbers. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function, but it is expected that the inputs should be valid (positive real numbers) to avoid division by zero or other arithmetic errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
