Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base length of a triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of a prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). This formula computes the area of the triangular base \((b * h / 2)\) and then multiplies it by the length of the prism `l` to get the volume. The function assumes that all inputs are positive real numbers. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function, but it is expected that the inputs should be valid (positive real numbers) to avoid division by zero or other arithmetic errors.**
