The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All these parameters are positive real numbers. The function returns the value of \((b * h / 2) * l\), where `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, representing the base length of a triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of a prism respectively, and return the volume of a triangular prism calculated using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\).
