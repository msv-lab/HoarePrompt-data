The code calculates the `base_area` as 0.5 times the product of `base` and `height`. The value of `length` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`, `length` is non-negative, and `base` and `height` are non-negative floating point numbers.**
