The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These parameters are non-negative floating point numbers. The function calculates the volume of a prism where the base area is given by 0.5 * base * height and then multiplies this area by the length. The function returns the calculated volume.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length (all non-negative floating point numbers), and returns the volume of a prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
