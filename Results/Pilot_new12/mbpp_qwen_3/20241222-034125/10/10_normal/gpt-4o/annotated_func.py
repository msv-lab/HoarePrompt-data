#State of the program right berfore the function call: base, height, and length are non-negative floating point numbers.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns 0.5 * base * height * length, where base_area is 0.5 * base * height and length is a non-negative number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which are all non-negative floating-point numbers. It calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). First, it computes the area of the triangular base as \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\) and stores it in the variable `base_area`. Then, it multiplies this area by the `length` to get the volume of the prism. The function returns this calculated volume. There are no explicit edge cases in the provided code, but it assumes that `base`, `height`, and `length` are always non-negative, which is correctly reflected in the return postconditions.
