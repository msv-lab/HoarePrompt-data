Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The function accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point numbers. It follows the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\).

- The program first calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
- It then multiplies this area by the `length` to get the volume of the prism.
- The function returns this calculated volume.

The assertions provided in the comments confirm that the function behaves as expected with different sets of input values. Since the function correctly implements the formula and handles the inputs as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
