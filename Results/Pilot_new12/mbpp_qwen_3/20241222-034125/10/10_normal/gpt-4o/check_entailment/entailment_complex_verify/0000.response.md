Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version reinforces that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The test cases provided in the assertions validate the function for different inputs, and the annotations clearly show that the function handles non-negative floating-point numbers as expected. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the final assessment remains True.
