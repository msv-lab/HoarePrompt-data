Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The annotations confirm that the function accepts non-negative floating-point numbers as inputs and correctly computes the volume using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The test cases provided in the code also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness as True is justified.
