Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]. The test cases validate this formula with different sets of inputs. The annotated version confirms that the inputs (base, height, and length) are non-negative, and the function returns the expected result, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
