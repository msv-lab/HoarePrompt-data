Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]

The given test cases also validate this formula:

1. For \( \text{base} = 10 \), \( \text{height} = 8 \), and \( \text{length} = 6 \), the base area is \( 0.5 \times 10 \times 8 = 40 \), and the volume is \( 40 \times 6 = 240 \).
2. For \( \text{base} = 3 \), \( \text{height} = 2 \), and \( \text{length} = 2 \), the base area is \( 0.5 \times 3 \times 2 = 3 \), and the volume is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).
3. For \( \text{base} = 1 \), \( \text{height} = 2 \), and \( \text{length} = 1 \), the base area is \( 0.5 \times 1 \times 2 = 1 \), and the volume is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the formula used is mathematically sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
