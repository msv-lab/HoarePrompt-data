Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, and the test cases validate its correctness. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input types (non-negative floating-point numbers) and correctly performs the necessary calculations. Since the provided code meets the requirements and the test cases cover valid inputs without any issues, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is justified.
