Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The given test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1(10, 8, 6)` returns 240, which is correct because the base area is \(0.5 \times 10 \times 8 = 40\) and the volume is \(40 \times 6 = 240\).
2. `func_1(3, 2, 2)` returns 6, which is correct because the base area is \(0.5 \times 3 \times 2 = 3\) and the volume is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).
3. `func_1(1, 2, 1)` returns 1, which is correct because the base area is \(0.5 \times 1 \times 2 = 1\) and the volume is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and the provided test cases cover various valid inputs, there is no evidence of a potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
