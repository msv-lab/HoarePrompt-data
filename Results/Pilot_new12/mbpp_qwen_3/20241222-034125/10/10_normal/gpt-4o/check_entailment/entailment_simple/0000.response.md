Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The problem description requires a function to find the volume of a triangular prism, which can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \).

The function `func_1` follows this formula:
1. It first computes the base area using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
2. Then, it calculates the volume by multiplying the base area by the length: \( \text{volume} = \text{base\_area} \times \text{length} \).

The provided test cases (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for different sets of inputs, verifying its correctness according to the problem description. Since the function correctly implements the required formula and the test cases pass, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
