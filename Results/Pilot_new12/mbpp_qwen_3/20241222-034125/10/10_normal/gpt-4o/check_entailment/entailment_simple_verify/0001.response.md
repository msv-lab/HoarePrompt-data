Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes these tests. The state annotations indicate that the inputs are non-negative floating point numbers, which aligns with the problem description requiring valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
