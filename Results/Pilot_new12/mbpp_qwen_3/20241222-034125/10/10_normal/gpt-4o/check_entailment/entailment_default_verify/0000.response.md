Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The test cases validate this implementation, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting non-negative floating-point numbers as inputs and returning the correct volume according to the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). Since the program meets the problem description and the provided test cases and output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is correct.
