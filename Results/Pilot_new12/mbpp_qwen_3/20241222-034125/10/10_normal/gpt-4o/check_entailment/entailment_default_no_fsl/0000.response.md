Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The assertions provided in the code verify that the function works for the given test cases. Since the code handles the required inputs (non-negative floating-point numbers) and correctly applies the formula, it meets the problem description for every potential case within the assumptions given. Therefore, the program is correct.
