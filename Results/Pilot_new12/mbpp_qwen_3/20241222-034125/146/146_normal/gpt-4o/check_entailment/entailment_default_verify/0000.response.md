Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each list, updates the maximum length and corresponding list as needed, and returns the correct values even if the input list is empty. The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
