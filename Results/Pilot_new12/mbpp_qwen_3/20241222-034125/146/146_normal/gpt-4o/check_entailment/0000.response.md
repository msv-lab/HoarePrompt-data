Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The function iterates through each list in the input, keeps track of the maximum length found so far and the corresponding list. It returns the length of the longest list and the list itself. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since no counterexample has been found where the program fails to meet the problem description, the program is correct.
