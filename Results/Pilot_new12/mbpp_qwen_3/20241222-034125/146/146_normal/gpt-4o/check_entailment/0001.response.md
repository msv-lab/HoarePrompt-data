Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in each of the given test cases. The function iterates through each list in the input list of lists, keeps track of the maximum length encountered and the corresponding list, and returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list itself. Given the assertions provided, the function works correctly for the examples shown. Since no other edge cases or potential issues were identified that would cause the function to fail, the function is considered correct.
