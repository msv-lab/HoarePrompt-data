Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns both the length of this list and the list itself.
2. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` as an empty list.
   - It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the current list's length is greater than `max_len`.
   - If so, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
   - After iterating through all lists, it returns the tuple `(max_len, max_list)` containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly with different inputs:
- When given `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, it returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.
- When given `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, it returns `(4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`.
- When given `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, it returns `(3, [15, 20, 25])`.

Since the program consistently implements the logic required by the problem description and passes all provided test cases, the program is correct.
