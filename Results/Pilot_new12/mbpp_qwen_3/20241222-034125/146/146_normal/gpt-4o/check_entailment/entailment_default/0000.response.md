Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through each list in the input `list_of_lists`, finds the longest list, and returns its length along with the list itself. The code handles the case where all lists have the same length by setting `max_list` to the last list found during the iteration, which is a valid approach. Additionally, the code handles the case where the input list is empty by returning `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. The assertions in the provided examples also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
