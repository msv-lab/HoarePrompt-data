Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function accepts a single argument `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. This is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that even if the input list is empty, the function still returns valid values (0 and an empty list).
   - It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` and updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever it finds a list longer than the current `max_len`.
   - After the loop, the function returns both `max_len` and `max_list`. This ensures that the function provides both the length and the actual list of maximum length.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function correctly returns `(0, [])`.
   - If all lists in `list_of_lists` have the same length, the function correctly sets `max_list` to the last list found during the iteration.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions check various scenarios, including different lengths of lists and multiple lists of the same length, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in different cases.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic to find the longest list in a list of lists and handles all specified edge cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
