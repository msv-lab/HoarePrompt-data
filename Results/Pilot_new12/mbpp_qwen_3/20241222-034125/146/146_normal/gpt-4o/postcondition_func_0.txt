The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the longest list based on the number of elements it contains. After completing the iteration, it returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest list found in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references the longest list. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. The function handles the case where all lists in `list_of_lists` have the same length by setting `max_list` to the last list found during the iteration.
