#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element is a list itself.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list. `max_len` is the length of the longest list found in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` references the longest list found.
    return max_len, max_list
    #`The program returns max_len which is the length of the longest list found in list_of_lists, and max_list which references the longest list found`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the longest list based on the number of elements it contains. After completing the iteration, it returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest list found in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references the longest list. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. The function handles the case where all lists in `list_of_lists` have the same length by setting `max_list` to the last list found during the iteration.
