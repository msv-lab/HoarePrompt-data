Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list.
   - If the length of the current list `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` references the same list as `lst`. Otherwise, the values of `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each list in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each list `lst`, it checks if its length is greater than `max_len`.
   - If it is, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` references the same list as `lst`.
   - If not, `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

3. **Considering the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, there must be at least one list remaining in `list_of_lists` to iterate over.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `list_of_lists` must still contain at least one list.
   - The values of `max_len` and `max_list` could either have been updated or remained unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the condition for continuing the loop is that `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, we need to ensure this condition holds true.
   - The values of `max_len` and `max_list` might have changed, but they are not strictly required to change for the loop to continue; they only need to reflect their current values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is as it is from the previous iteration, and `max_list` references the same list as it was in the previous iteration.**
