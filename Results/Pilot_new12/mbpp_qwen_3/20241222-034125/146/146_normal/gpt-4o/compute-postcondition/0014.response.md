Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list. `max_len` and `max_list` retain their previous values unless the current `lst` was longer than `max_len`, in which case `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is updated to `lst`. The next `lst` in `list_of_lists` will be processed.***
