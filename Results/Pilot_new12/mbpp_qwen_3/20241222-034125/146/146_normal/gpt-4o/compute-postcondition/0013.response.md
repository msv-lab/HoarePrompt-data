The code `max_list = lst` assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. This operation does not affect the value of `max_len`. The previous values of `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_len` is updated to the length of the current `lst` if `lst` is longer than `max_len`; otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged; `max_list` is now equal to `lst`.**
