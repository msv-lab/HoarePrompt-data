The code assigns the current value of `lst` to `max_list`. This means that `max_list` now references the same list object that `lst` references. The lengths of both `lst` and `max_list` are the same, which is `max_len`. The `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`**
