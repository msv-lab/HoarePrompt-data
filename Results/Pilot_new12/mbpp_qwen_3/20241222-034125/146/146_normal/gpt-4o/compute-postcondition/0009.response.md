The code `max_list = lst` assigns the variable `max_list` to reference the same list that `lst` references. The previous value of `max_list` is now updated to reference the same list as `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, and `max_list` references the same list as `lst`.**
