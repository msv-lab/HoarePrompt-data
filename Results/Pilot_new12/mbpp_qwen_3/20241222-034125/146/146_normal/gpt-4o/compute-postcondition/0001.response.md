The code initializes an empty list named `max_list`. The value of `max_len` remains unchanged, and `list_of_lists` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only updated value is the creation of the `max_list` variable.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list itself, and `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list**
