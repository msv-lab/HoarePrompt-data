The code sets `max_len` to the length of the list `lst`. Since `lst` is part of `list_of_lists` and its length is greater than the previous `max_len`, `max_len` is now updated to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is also updated to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is `lst`.**
