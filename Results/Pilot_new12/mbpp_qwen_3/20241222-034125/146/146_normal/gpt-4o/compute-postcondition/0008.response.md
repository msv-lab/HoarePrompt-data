The code `max_len = len(lst)` calculates the length of the list referenced by `lst` and assigns it to `max_len`. The value of `max_len` is updated based on the length of `lst`, and `max_list` remains unchanged as it references the same list as before. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, and `max_list` references the same list as it was in the previous iteration.**
