The variable `max_len` is assigned the value `0`, but the length of the lists within `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list itself, and `max_len` is 0.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list itself, and `max_len` is 0**
