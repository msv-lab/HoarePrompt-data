Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list. If the length of the current list `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` references the same list as `lst`. Otherwise, the values of `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
