According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. The loop will execute if `list_of_lists` contains at least one list. The initial state given is that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list itself, and `max_len` is 0; `max_list` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list**
