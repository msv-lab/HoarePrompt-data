#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #`max_len` which is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]` which is the first sublist from the list of sublists in `list_of_lists` where the length of each sublist is equal to `max_len`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length of any sublist within `list_of_lists` and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist from the list of sublists that have this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists, the function will return `(0, [])`.
