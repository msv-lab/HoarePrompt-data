The code creates a new list `max_sublists` which contains only those sublists from `list_of_lists` whose lengths are equal to `max_len`. The original `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated definition of `max_sublists` and the unchanged values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each element is a list; `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where the length of each sublist is equal to `max_len`**
