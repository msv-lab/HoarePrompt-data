Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length of any sublist within `list_of_lists` and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist from the list of sublists that have this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists, the function will return `(0, [])`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `(0, [])`.
- If all sublists in `list_of_lists` are empty, the function will still return `(0, [])`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` contains non-list elements or elements that are not lists at all. In such cases, the function might raise a `TypeError`. However, the function does not explicitly handle or account for these scenarios. Therefore, it is assumed that the input is correctly formatted as a list of lists.
