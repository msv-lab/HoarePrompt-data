The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each element is a list. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist from the list of sublists in `list_of_lists` where the length of each sublist is equal to `max_len`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the maximum length of any sublist in list_of_lists and the first sublist from the list of sublists where the length is equal to the maximum length.**
