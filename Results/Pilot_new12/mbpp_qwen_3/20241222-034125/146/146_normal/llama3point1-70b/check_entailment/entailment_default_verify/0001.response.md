Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. The provided output hints confirm this, stating that the function returns the maximum length along with the first sublist from the list of sublists that have this maximum length. This does not align with the problem description, which explicitly states that the function should return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected as suggested to meet the problem requirements.
