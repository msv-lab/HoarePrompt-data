Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, instead of returning a list of all such sublists. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. The annotation explicitly states that the function returns `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist meeting the condition, rather than a list of all such sublists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the problem description.
