Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the function should return the list of maximum length from a list of lists. However, the program currently returns `max_len` (which is the length of the longest sublist) and the first sublist with the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). 

To meet the problem description, the function should return all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```

In this corrected version, `max_sublists` contains all sublists that have the maximum length, ensuring that the function returns all relevant results as required by the problem description.
