You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist with that length. However, the problem description asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]
```
The maximum length of sublists is 3, and there are two sublists with this length: `[3, 4, 5]` and `[6, 7, 8]`. The function should return a list containing both of these sublists. However, the function currently returns only the first sublist `[6, 7, 8]`.

To fix this, the function should modify the line:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```
to:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length of any sublist within `list_of_lists` and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist from the list of sublists that have this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists, the function will return `(0, [])`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
