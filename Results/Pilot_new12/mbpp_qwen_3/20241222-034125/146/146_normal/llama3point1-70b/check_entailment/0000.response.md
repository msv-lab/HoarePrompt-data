Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. Instead, it returns only the first sublist with the maximum length. For example, consider the following input:

```
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11]]
```

The maximum length is 4, and there is one sublist with this length: `[6, 7, 8, 9]`. However, the program will return `(4, [1, 2])`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
