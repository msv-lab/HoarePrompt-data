Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, whereas the problem description asks for a list of all sublists with the maximum length. For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]`. The correct output should be `(4, [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])`, but the given code will return `(4, [1, 2])`. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
