Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist with that length. However, the problem description asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]
```
The maximum length of sublists is 3, and there are two sublists with this length: `[3, 4, 5]` and `[6, 7, 8]`. The function should return a list containing both of these sublists. However, the function currently returns only the first sublist `[6, 7, 8]`.

To fix this, the function should modify the line:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```
to:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
