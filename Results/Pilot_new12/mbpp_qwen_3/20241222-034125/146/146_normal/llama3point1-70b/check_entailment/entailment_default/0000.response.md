Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) and returns the maximum length of any sublist within this list along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. 

- If `list_of_lists` is not empty and contains at least one non-empty sublist, the function correctly calculates the maximum length using `max_len`.
- It then collects all sublists that have this maximum length into `max_sublists` and returns the first such sublist.

The output hints confirm this behavior and provide an example for the edge case where `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists, in which case the function correctly returns `(0, [])`.

Since the code handles all described cases without issues, the correctness is **True**.
