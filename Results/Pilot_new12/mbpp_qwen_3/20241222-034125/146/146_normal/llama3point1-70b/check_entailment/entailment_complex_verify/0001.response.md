Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to return a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist with that length. However, the problem description explicitly asks for a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. The annotated version confirms this by stating that the function returns `max_len, max_sublists[0]`, which is incorrect according to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and should return a list of all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one.
