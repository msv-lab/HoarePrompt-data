Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the problem description because it returns the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist that matches this maximum length. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. 

To correct this, the function should return `max_sublists` instead of `max_sublists[0]`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```

With this correction, the function will always return the maximum length of the sublists and all sublists that have this maximum length, thereby meeting the problem description.
