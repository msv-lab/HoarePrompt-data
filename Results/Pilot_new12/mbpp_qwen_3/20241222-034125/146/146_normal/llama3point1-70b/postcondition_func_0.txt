The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length of any sublist within `list_of_lists` and returns this maximum length along with the first sublist from the list of sublists that have this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists, the function will return `(0, [])`.
