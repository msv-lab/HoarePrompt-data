#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns max_val - min_val
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. It achieves this by first finding the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the list. Then, it calculates the difference between these two values (`max_diff = max_val - min_val`). The function ensures that the list is not empty by leveraging the built-in `min` and `max` functions, which will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty. The function then returns this difference. Potential edge cases include the list being empty, in which case the function would raise a `ValueError`.
