The code `max_val = max(arr)` assigns the maximum value in the list `arr` to the variable `max_val`. The minimum value in `arr` is still stored in `min_val`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`; `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`**
