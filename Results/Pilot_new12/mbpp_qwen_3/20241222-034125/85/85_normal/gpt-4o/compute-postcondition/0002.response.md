The code `max_diff = max_val - min_val` calculates the difference between the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) in the list `arr`. This difference is then assigned to the variable `max_diff`. The values of `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`; `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`; `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`**
