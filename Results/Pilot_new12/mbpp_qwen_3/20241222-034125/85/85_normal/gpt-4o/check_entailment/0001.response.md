Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculates their difference. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (increasing order, decreasing order, and mixed order) and the function passes all of them. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that this function does not handle, making it correct for the given problem description.
