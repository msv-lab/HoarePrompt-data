Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function leverages the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. It then computes the difference between these two values, which accurately represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The output hints further confirm that the function handles potential edge cases, such as an empty list, by raising a `ValueError`. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the provided code meets this requirement, the original assessment is correct.
