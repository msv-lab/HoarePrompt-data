Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (increasing order, decreasing order, and mixed order) and the function passes all of them. The annotated version of the code supports this correctness by clearly indicating that `arr` is a list of integers before the function call, and the function correctly computes the maximum difference by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating their difference. There is no indication in the annotations or the code that suggests any logical errors or missing edge cases.
