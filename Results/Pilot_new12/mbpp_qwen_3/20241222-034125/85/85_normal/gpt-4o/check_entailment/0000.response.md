Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and computes their difference. This approach ensures that the function works for any list of integers, including edge cases such as an array with duplicate values, an array with all identical values, or an array with negative numbers. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
