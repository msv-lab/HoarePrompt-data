Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the array, respectively, and then calculates the difference. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (positive numbers, descending order, and a small array) and demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function handles the given problem description correctly and the examples provided in the output hints match the behavior of the function, the program is correct.
