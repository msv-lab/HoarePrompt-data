Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and calculating their difference. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them. The output hints confirm that the function handles the potential edge case of an empty list by leveraging the built-in `min` and `max` functions, which raise a `ValueError` for empty lists. Since we assume valid input, the function's behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
