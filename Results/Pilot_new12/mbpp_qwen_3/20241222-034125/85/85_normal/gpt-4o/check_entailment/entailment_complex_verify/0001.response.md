Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotated version further clarifies that the function uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. These functions ensure that the list is not empty, as attempting to find the minimum or maximum of an empty list would indeed raise a `ValueError`. Since the problem description requires the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios, the function appears to be correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
