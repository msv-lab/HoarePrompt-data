Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires writing a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (which, in this context, can be represented as a list of integers).

The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and performs the following steps:
1. Finds the minimum value in the list using `min(arr)`.
2. Finds the maximum value in the list using `max(arr)`.
3. Computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`max_val - min_val`).
4. Returns this difference.

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`. The difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which matches the expected output.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`. The difference is `9 - 1 = 8`, which matches the expected output.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`. The difference is `3 - 1 = 2`, which matches the expected output.

Since the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array and the test cases validate its correctness, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
