Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and computing their difference. The annotations confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including edge cases such as arrays with duplicate values, all identical values, and negative numbers. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
