Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. Hereâ€™s how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input will be a valid list of integers, as indicated by the problem description. If the input is not a list or contains non-integer elements, the built-in `min` and `max` functions will raise a `ValueError`. Given the instruction to assume valid input, the function behaves correctly.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Difference**: The function correctly identifies the minimum value in the list using `min(arr)` and the maximum value using `max(arr)`. It then computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which gives the desired result.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, such as:
   - A list with at least two elements (e.g., `[2, 1, 5, 3]`, `[9, 3, 2, 5, 1]`, `[3, 2, 1]`).
   - A list with exactly two elements.
   - A list with three or more elements.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions verify the function's behavior across different scenarios, confirming that the function correctly computes the maximum difference for the given inputs.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and handles all necessary cases without deviation, the program is correct.
