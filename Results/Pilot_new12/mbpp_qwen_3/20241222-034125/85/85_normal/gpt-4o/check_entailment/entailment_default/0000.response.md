Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array of integers and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. This is achieved by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculating their difference. The code handles the potential edge case of an empty array by relying on the built-in `min` and `max` functions, which will raise a `ValueError` if the array is empty. Given the examples provided, the function works correctly for the cases where the array contains at least one element. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
