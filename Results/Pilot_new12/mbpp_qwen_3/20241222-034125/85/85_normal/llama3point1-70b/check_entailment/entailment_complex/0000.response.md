Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. This directly follows the problem description which states: "Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array."

The program uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the list, respectively, and then calculates their difference. While the program does not explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty (which would cause a `ValueError` when calling `max()` or `min()`), the problem statement specifies that we assume the input will be valid. Therefore, under this assumption, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
