Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly indicate that the function `func_1` computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, stating that `arr` is a list of integers before the function call, and the function returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The original assessment is accurate in concluding that the program is correct.
