Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach works for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as empty arrays (though the function would raise a `ValueError` for an empty array, which is the expected behavior for this problem), arrays with duplicate values, and arrays with negative numbers. Since the problem description does not specify handling of empty arrays explicitly, we assume the function should return a specific value or handle it appropriately, which this function does by using `max()` and `min()` directly.
