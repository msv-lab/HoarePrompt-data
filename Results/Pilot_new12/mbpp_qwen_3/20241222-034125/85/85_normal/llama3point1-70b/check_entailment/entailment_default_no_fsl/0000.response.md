Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. When an empty list is passed to the `max()` or `min()` function, it raises a `ValueError`. Since the code does not account for this scenario, it will leave the program in an undefined state, potentially crashing. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
