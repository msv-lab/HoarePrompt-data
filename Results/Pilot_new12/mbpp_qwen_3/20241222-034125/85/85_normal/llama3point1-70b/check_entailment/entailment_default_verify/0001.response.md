Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function `func_1` is correct without addressing the case where the input list `arr` is empty. According to the output hints, if the list is empty, the `max()` and `min()` functions would raise a `ValueError`. Since the function does not handle this case, it will leave the program in an undefined state, potentially crashing. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs, making the original assessment inaccurate.
