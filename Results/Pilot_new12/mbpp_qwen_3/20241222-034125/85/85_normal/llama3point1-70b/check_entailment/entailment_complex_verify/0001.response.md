Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment assumes that the function `func_1` will work correctly for all inputs, including the case where the input list `arr` is empty. However, the annotated version explicitly mentions that if the list `arr` is empty, the `max()` and `min()` functions would raise a `ValueError`. Since the function does not handle this case, leaving the program in an undefined state could result in a crash. Therefore, the function does not fully meet the problem description, as it does not account for the possibility of an empty input list.
