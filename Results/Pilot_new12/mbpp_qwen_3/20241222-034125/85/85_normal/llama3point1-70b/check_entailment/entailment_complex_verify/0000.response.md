Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The annotated version confirms that the function uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to achieve this. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, the original problem description did not specify how to handle empty lists. Therefore, returning a specific value or raising an error is acceptable. Since the problem description does not provide additional requirements, the function's behavior aligns with the given problem. Hence, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
