Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array by using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions. The function works for all potential cases where the input array is non-empty. While the output hints mention that the function will leave the program in an undefined state if the list is empty, the problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle the empty list case. Therefore, assuming the input is always valid as stated in the instructions, the function is correct for every potential case.
