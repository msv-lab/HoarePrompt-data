Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`) and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. This directly addresses the problem description, which asks for a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Since the function correctly implements this logic and there are no edge cases or special scenarios mentioned in the original assessment that would invalidate its correctness under the given assumptions (valid input), the original assessment remains valid.
