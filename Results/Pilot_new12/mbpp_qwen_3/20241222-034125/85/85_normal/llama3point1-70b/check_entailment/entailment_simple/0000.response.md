Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input (`arr`) and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. This is achieved by calculating the difference between the maximum value (`max(arr)`) and the minimum value (`min(arr)`) in the list. Since the problem description specifies finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the program correctly implements this functionality, the program is correct.
