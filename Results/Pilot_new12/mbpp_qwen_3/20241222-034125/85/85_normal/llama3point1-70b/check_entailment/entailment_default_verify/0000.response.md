Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array for non-empty lists, the original assessment did not account for the potential `ValueError` that would be raised if the input list is empty. The output hints clarify that the function leaves the program in an undefined state if the list is empty, which means the function does not handle empty arrays appropriately. Since the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle empty arrays, it is crucial to either raise an error, return a specific value, or handle it in a way that aligns with typical expectations for such operations. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be maintained, and the program is considered incorrect due to its lack of proper handling for empty input lists.
