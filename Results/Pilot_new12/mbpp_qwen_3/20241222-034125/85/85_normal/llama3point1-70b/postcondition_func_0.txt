The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. It achieves this by calling the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions on the list `arr`. The function handles the case where the list `arr` is non-empty. If the list is empty, the `max()` and `min()` functions would raise a `ValueError`, but since the function does not handle this case, it will leave the program in an undefined state, potentially crashing.
