Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a predefined list of month numbers that have 31 days. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, returning `True` for months with 31 days (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for the other months. Since the function handles all valid inputs within the specified range (1 through 12) and there are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
