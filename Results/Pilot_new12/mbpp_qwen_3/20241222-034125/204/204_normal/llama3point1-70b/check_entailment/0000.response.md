Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. This approach covers all the potential cases as per the problem description. The function works correctly for all possible month numbers (1 through 12), and it accurately identifies which months have 31 days. Therefore, the program is correct.
