Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12) and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise. The logic is straightforward and accurately implements the problem description. The hardcoded list `months_31_days` contains all the month numbers that have 31 days, and the function simply checks if `n` is in this list. Since the problem description asks for a check on all potential cases (month numbers 1 through 12), and the code correctly handles all these cases, the program is correct.
