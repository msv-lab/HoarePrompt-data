Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number contains 31 days by verifying if the month number is in the list `months_31_days`. The annotated version of the code clearly states that `n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12, which aligns with the provided list. Since the function returns `True` if `n` is in the list and `False` otherwise, it correctly identifies months with 31 days. The annotated version confirms that there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
