Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents a month number between 1 and 12. The function checks if `n` is in the list of month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. If `n` is found in this list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the problem description specifies that the function should check whether the given month number contains 31 days, and the provided function does exactly that, the program meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
