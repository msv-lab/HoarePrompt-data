Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The annotations confirm that the function works as expected, returning `True` for months with 31 days (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for others. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified range (1 through 12) without any edge cases needing special handling. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
