Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by verifying if the input `n` is in the list `months_31_days`, which includes the correct month numbers for months with 31 days. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for others. There are no edge cases or inputs outside the valid range (1 through 12) that would cause the function to fail based on the provided problem description and the assumption of valid input. Thus, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
