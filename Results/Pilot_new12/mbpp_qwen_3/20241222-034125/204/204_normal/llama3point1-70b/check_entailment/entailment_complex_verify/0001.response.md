Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days by verifying if the month number is in the list `months_31_days`. The annotations clarify that the function returns `True` if the input `n` is one of the integers representing months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` otherwise. Since the function adheres to the problem description and the provided annotations do not indicate any issues or edge cases, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
