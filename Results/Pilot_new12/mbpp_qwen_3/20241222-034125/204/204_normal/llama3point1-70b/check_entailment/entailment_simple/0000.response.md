Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12) and checks if this month number is in the list of months that contain 31 days. The list `months_31_days` contains the integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which correspond to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December respectivelyâ€”these are the months with 31 days.

The function returns `True` if `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise. This perfectly matches the requirement to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. Since the function handles all valid inputs (i.e., integers from 1 to 12) as specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
