Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 31 days by seeing if the month number is in the list `months_31_days`. This list correctly contains the numbers representing months that have 31 days (1 for January, 3 for March, 5 for May, etc.). Since the function returns `True` if the input `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise, it correctly identifies months with 31 days for the cases included in the list. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
