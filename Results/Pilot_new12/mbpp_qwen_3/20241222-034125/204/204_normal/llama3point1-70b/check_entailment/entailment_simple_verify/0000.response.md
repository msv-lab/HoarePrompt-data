Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The annotated version confirms that the input `n` is an integer representing a month number within the valid range (1 through 12). The function uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. Since the function accurately identifies the months with 31 days and handles all valid inputs within the specified range, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
