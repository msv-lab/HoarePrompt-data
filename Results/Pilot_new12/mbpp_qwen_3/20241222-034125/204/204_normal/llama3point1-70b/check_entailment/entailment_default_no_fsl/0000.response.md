Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. The output hints confirm that this logic covers all valid inputs within the specified range (1 through 12), and there are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case described in the problem.
