#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if n is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] or False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12). It checks whether `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days. The function returns `True` if `n` is in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the logic is straightforward and covers all valid inputs within the specified range.
