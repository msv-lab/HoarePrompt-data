The code initializes a list `months_31_days` containing integers representing months that have 31 days. However, the code itself does not perform any operations that would change the value of `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12. `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
