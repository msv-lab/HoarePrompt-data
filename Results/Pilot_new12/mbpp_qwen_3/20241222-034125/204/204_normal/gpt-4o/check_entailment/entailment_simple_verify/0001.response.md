Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by comparing the month against a set of months that have 31 days. The provided assertions cover all the months with and without 31 days, and the function behaves as expected based on the annotated version. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
