Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by using a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the state of the program and the logic used, which aligns with the problem description. All the provided assertions are handled correctly, and the program's logic appears to be comprehensive for the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as True remains valid.
