Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input and checks whether it is one of the months that contain 31 days. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the integers representing these months (1 for January, 3 for March, 5 for May, etc.). By checking if the input `month` is in this set, the function accurately determines whether the month has 31 days or not. 

The provided assertions cover all the months from 1 to 12 and confirm the expected behavior:
- Months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) return `True`.
- Months without 31 days (2, 4, 6, 9, 11) return `False`.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and passes all test cases, it is correct.
