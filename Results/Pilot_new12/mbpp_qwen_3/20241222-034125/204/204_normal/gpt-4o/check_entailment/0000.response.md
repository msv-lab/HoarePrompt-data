Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then returns whether the given month is in this set. Based on the problem description, this approach is correct for the given month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). The program handles all the provided assertions correctly and the logic seems to cover all potential cases for month numbers with 31 days. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
