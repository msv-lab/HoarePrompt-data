Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it corresponds to a month with 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` contains the integers representing the months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function returns `True` if the input month is in this set and `False` otherwise. Given the assertions, the function correctly returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for months 2, 6, and 11, which are not in the set of months with 31 days. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case.
