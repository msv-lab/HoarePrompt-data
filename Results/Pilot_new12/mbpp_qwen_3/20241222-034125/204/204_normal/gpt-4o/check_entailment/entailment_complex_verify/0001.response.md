Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by comparing the month against a predefined set of months that have 31 days. The test cases provided in the assertions cover all relevant cases, and the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected for all months between 1 and 12. Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and the provided test cases are consistent with the expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
