Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by comparing the month against a predefined set of months with 31 days. The test cases provided in the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for both months with and without 31 days. Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function accepts an integer `month` within the valid range of 1 to 12, which further supports the correctness of the program. There are no contradictions or inconsistencies between the problem description, the code, and the output hints that would warrant a change in the original assessment.
