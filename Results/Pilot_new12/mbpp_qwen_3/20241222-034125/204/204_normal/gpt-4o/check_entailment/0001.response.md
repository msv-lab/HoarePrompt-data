Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 31 days by using a set of month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the month is in the set and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided cover the months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and the months without 31 days (2, 6, 11). Since the function behaves correctly for these test cases and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct for all potential cases.
