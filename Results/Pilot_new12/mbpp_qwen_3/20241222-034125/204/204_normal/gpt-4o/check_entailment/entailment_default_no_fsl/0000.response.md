Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided cover all the months that either have 31 days or do not, and the code passes all these tests. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
