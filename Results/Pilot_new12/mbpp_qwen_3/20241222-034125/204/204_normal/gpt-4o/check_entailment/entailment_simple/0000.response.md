Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a month number as an input and checks if it corresponds to a month with 31 days. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` containing the integers representing months with 31 days (1 for January, 3 for March, etc.). By checking if the given month is in this set, the function accurately determines whether the month has 31 days or not. The provided test cases also correctly validate the function's behavior for all months from 1 to 12, confirming that the implementation is correct according to the problem description.
