The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as a parameter, which should be within the range 1 to 12 (inclusive). It checks whether the given `month` is one of the months with 31 days (i.e., January, March, May, July, August, October, December). If the month is in this set, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify any input or local variables; it only evaluates the condition and returns the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need special handling, as the code correctly implements the described behavior.
