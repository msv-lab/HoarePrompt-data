Output State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, every element in `tup` is of type `first_type`**.

### Explanation:

- **Initial State:** `tup` is a non-empty tuple, and `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`.

- **Loop Code Analysis:**
  - The loop iterates over each element in `tup`.
  - It checks if the type of each element is not equal to `first_type`.
  - If any element's type is not `first_type`, the function immediately returns `False`.

- **Output State After the Loop Executes:**
  - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`.

- **Conclusion:**
  - If the loop executes completely (i.e., it goes through all elements in `tup`), then all elements in `tup` must be of type `first_type`. If any element is not of type `first_type`, the function would have returned `False` during the iteration.
  
Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the tuple `tup` must contain only elements of type `first_type`.
