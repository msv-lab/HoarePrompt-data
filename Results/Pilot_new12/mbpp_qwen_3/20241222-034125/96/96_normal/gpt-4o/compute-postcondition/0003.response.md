The code `first_type = type(tup[0])` assigns the type of the first element in the tuple `tup` to the variable `first_type`. The initial state is that `tup` is a non-empty tuple containing elements of any type. After executing this line of code, `first_type` will hold the type of the first element in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple; `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`**
