Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Here are the key points:

1. The function handles the case where the tuple is empty (`if not tup:`), returning `True`.
2. For non-empty tuples, it determines the type of the first element and checks if all other elements are of the same type.
3. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
   - All elements are integers: `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True`.
   - Mixed types (integer and string): `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False`.
   - All elements are integers: `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True`.

The annotations align with the function's logic and confirm that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
