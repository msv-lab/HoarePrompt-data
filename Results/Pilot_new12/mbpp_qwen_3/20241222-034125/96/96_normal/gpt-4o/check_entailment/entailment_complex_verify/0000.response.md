Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the empty tuple case by returning `True`, and iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match the type of the first element. The test cases provided in the annotations validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, confirming its correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
