Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The output hints align with the function's behavior and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Specifically:

- Case_1: The function returns `True` for an empty tuple, which is handled correctly.
- Case_2: The function returns `False` when the tuple contains elements of different types, as demonstrated by the assertion `func_1((1, 2, '4'))`.
- Case_3: The function returns `True` when the tuple contains elements of the same type, as demonstrated by the assertions `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` and `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))`.

Given that the function handles the edge case of an empty tuple and performs the type checking as described, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
