Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` which checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function handles all the described cases:
- It returns `True` for an empty tuple.
- It returns `False` for a tuple containing elements of different types.
- It returns `True` for a tuple containing elements of the same type.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements are of different types (integer and string).
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

Since the function behaves correctly according to the problem description and the test cases, the code is correct.
