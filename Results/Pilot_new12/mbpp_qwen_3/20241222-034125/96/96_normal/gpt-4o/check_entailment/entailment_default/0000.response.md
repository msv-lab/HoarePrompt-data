Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function works as follows:

1. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True` because there are no elements to check, satisfying the requirement.
2. It determines the type of the first element in the tuple.
3. It iterates through each element in the tuple, checking if its type matches the type of the first element.
4. If any element has a different type, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If all elements match the type of the first element, it returns `True`.

Given the provided test cases:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`: All elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`: The first two elements are integers, but the third is a string.
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`: All elements are integers.

The function handles these cases correctly, and based on the output hints, the function performs the required checks for different types of tuples. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
