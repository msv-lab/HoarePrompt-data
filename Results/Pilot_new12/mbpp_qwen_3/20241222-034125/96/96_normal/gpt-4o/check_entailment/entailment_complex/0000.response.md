Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The task is to write a function that checks whether all elements in a given tuple have the same data type.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
   - It first checks if the tuple is empty using `if (not tup) :`. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, as an empty tuple trivially satisfies the condition of having elements of the same type (since there are no elements).
   - If the tuple is not empty, it initializes `first_type` with the type of the first element in the tuple (`type(tup[0])`).
   - It then iterates over each element in the tuple. For each element, it checks if its type matches `first_type`. If any element does not match, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it means all elements have the same type, so it returns `True`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))`: All elements are integers, so the function should return `True`.
   - `func_1((1, 2, '4'))`: The elements are of different types (integer, integer, string), so the function should return `False`.
   - `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))`: All elements are integers, so the function should return `True`.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, thus meeting the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
