Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations support this by indicating that the function returns `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness is appropriate.
