Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the given tuple have the same data type. Here's why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function starts by checking if the tuple is empty (`if (not tup)`). If it is, the function immediately returns `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type (none).

2. **Type Comparison**: 
   - The function assigns the type of the first element in the tuple to `first_type`.
   - It then iterates through each element in the tuple using a `for` loop.
   - For each element, it checks if the type of the element is different from `first_type`. If any element has a different type, the function returns `False`.

3. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any elements with a different type, the function returns `True`.

Given the problem description, the function should return `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same data type and `False` otherwise. The provided implementation meets this requirement accurately for any valid tuple input. Therefore, the program is correct.
