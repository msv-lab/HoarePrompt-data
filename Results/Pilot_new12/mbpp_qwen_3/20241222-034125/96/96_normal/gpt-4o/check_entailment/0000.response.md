Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the empty tuple case by returning `True`, and iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match the type of the first element. Given the test cases provided:

1. `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
2. `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements include an integer and a string.
3. `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

These examples cover different scenarios, including mixed types and only one specific type. Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the program is correct.
