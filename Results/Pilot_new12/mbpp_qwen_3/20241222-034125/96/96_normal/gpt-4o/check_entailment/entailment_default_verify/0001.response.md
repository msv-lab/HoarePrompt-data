Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially satisfies the condition of having all elements of the same type. The function compares the type of each element with the type of the first element, ensuring that the entire tuple consists of elements of the same type. The provided test cases support this behavior, and the output hints align with the expected functionality. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
