You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the empty tuple case by returning `True`, and iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match the type of the first element. Given the test cases provided:

1. `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
2. `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements include an integer and a string.
3. `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

These examples cover different scenarios, including mixed types and only one specific type. Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: tup is a tuple containing elements of any type, and tup is not empty
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a non-empty tuple, every element in `tup` is of type `first_type`
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and checks if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`. If at least one element in the tuple is of a different type than the first element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function considers the following cases:
- Case_1: If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`.
- Case_2: If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.
- Case_3: If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be:
- If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`.
- If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.
- If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
