You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element to compare with the rest, ensuring consistency. All provided test cases (`func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`, `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`, `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`) are correctly evaluated. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios and follows the problem description, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and checks if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`. If at least one element in the tuple is of a different type than the first element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function considers the following cases:
- Case_1: If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`.
- Case_2: If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.
- Case_3: If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes will be:
- If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`.
- If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function returns `False`.
- If the tuple contains elements of the same type, the function returns `True`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
