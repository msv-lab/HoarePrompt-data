Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insight into the state of the program at various points. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element to compare with the rest, ensuring consistency. The provided test cases are correctly evaluated, confirming the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
