Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type (none). The function uses the type of the first element to compare with the rest, ensuring consistency. All provided test cases (`func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True`, `func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False`, `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True`) are correctly evaluated. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios and follows the problem description, it is correct.
