#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in the tuple 'tup' have the same type, or False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same type, otherwise it returns `False`. It achieves this by converting each element in the tuple to its type and then using a set to check if all types are the same. If the set contains only one type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, which would result in a `TypeError` when calling `type()` on an undefined value.
