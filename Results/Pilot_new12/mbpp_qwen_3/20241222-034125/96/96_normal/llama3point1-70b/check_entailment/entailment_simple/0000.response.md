Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
2. **Type Checking**: Inside the function, a set comprehension is used to collect the types of all elements in the tuple `tup`. Specifically, `type(x)` is applied to each element `x` in the tuple.
3. **Set Length Check**: The `set` data structure is used to ensure that all elements in the tuple have the same type. A set inherently contains unique elements, so if all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one unique type.
4. **Comparison and Return**: The length of the set is compared to 1 using the equality operator (`== 1`). If the length is 1, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given these points, the program correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
