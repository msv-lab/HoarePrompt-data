Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The function takes a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
2. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to iterate over each element `x` in the tuple `tup` and converts each element to its type.
3. The `set` function is used to create a set from these types. Since sets only contain unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the resulting set will contain only one type.
4. The function compares the length of this set to `1` using `len(set(...)) == 1`. If the length is `1`, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly implements the requirement of checking whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type, regardless of what that data type might be (e.g., int, str, float, etc.). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
