Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a generator expression to get the type of each element in the tuple and then converts it to a set. If the set contains only one type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The code handles the case where the tuple is not empty, and it does not raise a `TypeError` for an empty tuple because `set([])` is still valid and will contain no elements. Therefore, the function returns `True` for an empty tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected for non-empty tuples.
