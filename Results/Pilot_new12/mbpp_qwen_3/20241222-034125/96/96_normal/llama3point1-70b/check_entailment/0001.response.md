Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type by converting each element to its type and then using a set to ensure all types are identical. The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1, indicating all elements have the same type, and `False` otherwise. This logic correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
