Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element's type to a set and checking its length. If all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one unique type, which satisfies the condition `len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1`. This logic correctly implements the requirement to check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. There doesn't appear to be any edge case that this function would handle incorrectly based on the provided problem description.
