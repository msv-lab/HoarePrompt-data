Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection, there is a potential issue with the program's handling of an empty tuple. The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, which would result in a `TypeError` when calling `type()` on an undefined value. Since the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle empty tuples (although it could be reasonable to do so), the program's failure to handle this case means it is not fully robust. However, given the current problem description and the provided code, the original assessment was overly optimistic. The program should at least raise an error or return a specific value (e.g., `False`) for empty tuples to be considered correct. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the provided information.
