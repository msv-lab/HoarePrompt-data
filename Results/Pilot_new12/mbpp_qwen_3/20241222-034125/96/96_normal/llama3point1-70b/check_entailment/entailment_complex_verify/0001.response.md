Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type by converting each element to its type and using a set to ensure all types are identical. The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1, indicating all elements have the same type, and `False` otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and the annotated version supports this correctness without any contradictions. The original assessment correctly identifies the program as meeting the requirements.
