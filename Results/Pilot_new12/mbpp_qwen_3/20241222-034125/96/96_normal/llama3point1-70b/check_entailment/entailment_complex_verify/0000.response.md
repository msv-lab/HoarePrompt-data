Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by using a set to ensure there is only one unique type among the elements. The annotated version clarifies that the function returns `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same type and `False` otherwise. It also mentions that the function does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, which would indeed raise a `TypeError` when calling `type()` on an undefined value. However, based on the problem description, which does not specify handling such edge cases, the current implementation is correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
