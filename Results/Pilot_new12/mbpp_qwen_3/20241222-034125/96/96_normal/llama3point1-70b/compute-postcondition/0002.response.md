Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same type, otherwise it returns `False`. It achieves this by converting each element in the tuple to its type and then using a set to check if all types are the same. If the set contains only one type, it means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, which would result in a `TypeError` when calling `type()` on an undefined value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the tuple is empty, the function will raise a `TypeError` because `type(x)` cannot be called on an undefined value.
- If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function correctly returns `False`.
- If all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the function correctly returns `True`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case of an empty tuple, which should ideally return `False` or raise a specific error message.
