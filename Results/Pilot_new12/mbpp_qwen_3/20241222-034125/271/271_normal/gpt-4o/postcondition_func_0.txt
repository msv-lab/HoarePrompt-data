The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numeric values (integers or floats). It calculates the average of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The function handles the case where `tuples` might be empty, in which case it returns an empty list. No other edge cases are explicitly handled within the function.
