    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is a non-negative integer, `averages` is a list containing the averages of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`, `i` is `num_elements`, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements at the `i-1` position from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.
    return averages
    #The program returns `averages`, which is a list containing the averages of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numeric values (integers or floats). It calculates the average of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The function handles the case where `tuples` might be empty, in which case it returns an empty list. No other edge cases are explicitly handled within the function.
