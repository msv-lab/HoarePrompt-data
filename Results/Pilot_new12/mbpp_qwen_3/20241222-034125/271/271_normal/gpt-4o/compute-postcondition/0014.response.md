Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is a non-negative integer, `averages` is a list containing the averages of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`, `i` is `num_elements`, `elements_at_position` is a list of elements at the `i-1` position from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `num_elements` times, where `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first inner tuple of `tuples`.
- For each iteration `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `num_elements - 1`), the code calculates the average of the `i-th` element from each tuple in `tuples` and appends this average to the `averages` list.
- After the loop completes, `averages` will contain the average of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `num_elements` after the loop finishes.
- `elements_at_position` will be a list of the `i-th` elements (which would be the last elements since `i` is now `num_elements`) from each tuple in `tuples`.
- `avg` will be the average of these elements, calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

If the loop does not execute (`num_elements` is 0), then `averages` will remain an empty list, `i` will be 0, and `elements_at_position` and `avg` will not be defined since they are only computed within the loop body.
