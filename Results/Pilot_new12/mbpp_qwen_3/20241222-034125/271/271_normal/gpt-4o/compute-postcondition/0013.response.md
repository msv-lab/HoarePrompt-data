`averages` is a list containing `[avg, avg]`. The variable `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The code appends `avg` to the list `averages`. Therefore, `averages` will now contain `[avg, avg, avg]`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 3, `averages` is a list containing `[avg, avg, avg]`, `i` is 3, `elements_at_position` is a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.**
