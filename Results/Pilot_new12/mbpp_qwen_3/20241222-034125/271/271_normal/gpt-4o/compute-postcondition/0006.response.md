According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing `[avg]`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is the average of the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num_elements`. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 and the condition `num_elements` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing `[avg]`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the average of the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`.**
