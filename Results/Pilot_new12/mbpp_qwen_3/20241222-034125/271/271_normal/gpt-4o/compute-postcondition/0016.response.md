The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats). After executing the function body, it returns `averages`, which is a list containing the averages of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples `tuples` and return a list of averages of the elements at each position across all tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, and returns a list of averages of the elements at each position across all tuples.**
