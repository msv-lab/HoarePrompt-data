The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. Since `averages` initially contains `[avg]`, appending `avg` to it results in `averages` becoming `[avg, avg]`. The value of `avg` is the average of the third elements of each tuple in `tuples`, which remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing `[avg, avg]`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the average of the third elements of each tuple in `tuples`.**
