The code creates a list `elements_at_position` by extracting the `i`-th element from each tuple in the `tuples` tuple. Since `i` is 0, it extracts the first element from each tuple. The length of `elements_at_position` will be equal to the number of tuples in `tuples`. 

The value of `averages` remains an empty list, and the value of `i` is updated to 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`.**
