`averages` is an empty list before the code execution. The code appends `avg` to `averages`. The value of `avg` is the average of the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`. Therefore, after executing the code, `averages` will contain `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing `[avg]`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the average of the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`.**
