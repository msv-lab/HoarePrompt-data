The code updates the `elements_at_position` variable to contain the elements at position `i` (which is 2) from each tuple in the `tuples` tuple. Since `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` will now be a list containing the third element from each tuple in `tuples`. The other variables (`tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, `avg`, and `i`) are not affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing `[avg]`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the average of the first elements of each tuple in `tuples`.**
