Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numeric values (integers or floats). It calculates the average of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The function handles the case where `tuples` might be empty, in which case it returns an empty list. No other edge cases are explicitly handled within the function.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `tuples` is an empty tuple, the function correctly returns an empty list.
- If any of the inner tuples in `tuples` are also empty, the function will still proceed with the calculation assuming the outer tuple is not empty. This could lead to division by zero if all inner tuples are empty. However, since the function only checks the length of the first tuple, it does not handle the case where all inner tuples have different lengths or are empty.

**Missing functionality:**
- There is no check to ensure that all inner tuples in `tuples` have the same length. If the inner tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to access `t[i]` for an index `i` that does not exist in one of the inner tuples.
