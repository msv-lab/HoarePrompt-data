Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function iterates through each position in the first tuple (assuming all tuples have the same length), collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided assertions and the annotated version show that the function handles various test cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Since no counterexamples or issues are identified in the annotated version, the function remains correct according to the given problem description.
