Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at various points, and they align with the functionality of the function. Specifically:

1. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collecting the values at that position from all tuples.
2. It computes the average of these collected values and appends the result to the `averages` list.
3. The returned list of averages matches the expected results in the provided test cases.

Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
