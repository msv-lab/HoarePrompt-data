Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the elements at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The code handles the case where `tuples` might be empty by returning an empty list. Based on the provided assertions and the output hints, the code appears to work correctly for all given test cases and potential cases that can be inferred from the problem description.
