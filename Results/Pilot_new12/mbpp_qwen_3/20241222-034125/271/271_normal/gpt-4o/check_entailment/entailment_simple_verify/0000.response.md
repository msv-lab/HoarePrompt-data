Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function iterates through each position in the first tuple, collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The function handles all provided test cases correctly, and the annotations support this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
