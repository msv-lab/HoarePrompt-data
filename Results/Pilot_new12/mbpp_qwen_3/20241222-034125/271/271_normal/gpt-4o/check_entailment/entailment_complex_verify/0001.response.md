Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations support this correctness by describing the state of the program at different points and explaining the behavior of the function. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This process ensures that the function works correctly for any set of tuples where each tuple has the same number of elements. The provided test cases and the general logic of the function support the conclusion that the program meets the problem description.
