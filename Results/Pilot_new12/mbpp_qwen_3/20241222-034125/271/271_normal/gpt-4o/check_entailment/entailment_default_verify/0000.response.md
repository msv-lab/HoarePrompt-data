Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position, as evidenced by the test cases provided. The output hints confirm that the function handles the given requirements correctly, including the case where `tuples` might be empty. There are no counterexamples or edge cases mentioned that would indicate the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
