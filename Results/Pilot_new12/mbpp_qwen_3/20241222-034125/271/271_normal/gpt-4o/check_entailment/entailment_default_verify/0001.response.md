Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `tuples` might be empty, returning an empty list. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
