Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples. No explicit validation for this assumption is needed as per the problem statement's note about assuming valid inputs.

2. **Calculation of Averages**:
   - The function iterates over each position in the first tuple to extract the elements at that position from all tuples. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the number of tuples.
   - This process is repeated for each position, ensuring that the average is computed for each corresponding value across all tuples.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of averages, where each element corresponds to the average of the values at that position from all tuples.

4. **Example Outputs**:
   - The provided test cases demonstrate the function working as expected. For example:
     - For the input `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))`, the output `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]` is correct because:
       - Average of positions: `(10+30+81+1)/4 = 30.5`
       - Average of positions: `(10+45+80+2)/4 = 34.25`
       - Average of positions: `(10+56+39+3)/4 = 27.0`
       - Average of positions: `(12+45+32+4)/4 = 23.25`

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided solution handles edge cases such as tuples with different numbers of elements uniformly, and it computes averages accurately for all tested examples.

Given these points, the program consistently meets the problem description by calculating the required averages for each position across all tuples and returning them as a list. Thus, the program is correct.
