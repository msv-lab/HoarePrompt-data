Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function iterates through each position in the first tuple (assuming all tuples have the same length), collects the values at that position from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The function handles all provided test cases correctly and should work for any set of tuples with the same structure as long as they contain numerical values. Since no counterexamples were found, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
