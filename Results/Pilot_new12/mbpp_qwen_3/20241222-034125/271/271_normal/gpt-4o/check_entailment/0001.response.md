Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This process ensures that the function works correctly for any set of tuples where each tuple has the same number of elements. All provided test cases and the general logic of the function support this conclusion.
