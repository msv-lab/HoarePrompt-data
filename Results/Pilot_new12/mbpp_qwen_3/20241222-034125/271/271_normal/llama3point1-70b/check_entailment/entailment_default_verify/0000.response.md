Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list. The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where the input list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if the tuples have different lengths. The function also does not modify any input parameters and only returns the computed averages. Since the function correctly implements the described functionality for all potential cases, the program is correct.
