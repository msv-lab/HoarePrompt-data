Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of values where each value is the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the list. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of tuples, which aligns with the problem description stating that the function should take a tuple of tuples.
2. **Computation of Averages**: The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over corresponding elements across all tuples. It then calculates the average of these elements using `sum(val) / len(tuples)` for each position.
3. **Output**: The result is returned as a list of these computed averages, as required.
4. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description does not explicitly mention handling empty lists or tuples of different lengths, the function will still operate correctly for non-empty lists with tuples of the same length. For empty lists, the function returns an empty list, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
