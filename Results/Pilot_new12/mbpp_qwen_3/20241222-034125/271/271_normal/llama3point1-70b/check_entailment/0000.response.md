Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position across all tuples simultaneously. It then calculates the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach works for any input where the tuples have the same length. Since the function correctly implements the described functionality for all potential cases, the program is correct.
