Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the comprehension to iterate over each position across all tuples, and `sum(val) / len(tuples)` computes the average for each position. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a list of values, where each value is the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the list 'tuples'. Given that the problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, the provided function meets this requirement. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
