Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the comprehension to iterate over each position across all tuples, and `sum(val) / len(tuples)` computes the average for each position. This approach handles all cases where the tuples have the same number of elements. Since the problem does not specify any edge cases (such as empty tuples or tuples of different lengths), and the provided implementation works for all potential cases within its scope, the function is correct.
