Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position across all tuples simultaneously. It then calculates the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach ensures that the function works for any input where the tuples have the same length. Since the annotated version supports the correctness of the function and there are no contradictions with the problem description, the original assessment remains valid.
