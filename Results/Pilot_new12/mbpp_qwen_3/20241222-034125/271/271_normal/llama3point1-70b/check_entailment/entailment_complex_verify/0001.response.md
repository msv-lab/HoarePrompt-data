Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list. The annotated code clarifies that the function handles cases where the input list is empty by returning an empty list and raises a `ValueError` if tuples have different lengths. However, since the problem statement does not mention handling cases with tuples of different lengths, the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, assuming valid input as stated in the annotations. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
