Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the list `tuples`. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position across all tuples simultaneously. It then calculates the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. The annotations also mention that the function handles cases where the input list `tuples` is empty by returning an empty list. While the function will raise a `ValueError` if any tuple in the list has a different length due to the `zip(*tuples)` operation requiring all tuples to have the same length, the problem description does not specify handling such cases explicitly, so the function is considered correct under the given conditions.
