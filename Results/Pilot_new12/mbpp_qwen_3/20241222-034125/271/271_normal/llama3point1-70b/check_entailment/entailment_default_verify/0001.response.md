Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing the comprehension to iterate over each position across all tuples, and `sum(val) / len(tuples)` to compute the average for each position. The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where the input list `tuples` is empty, returning an empty list, and raises a `ValueError` if the tuples have different lengths, which aligns with the original problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
