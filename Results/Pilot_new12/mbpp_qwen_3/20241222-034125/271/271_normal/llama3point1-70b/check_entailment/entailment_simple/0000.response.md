Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

- The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values (either integers or floats).
- Inside the function, `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, creating an iterator of tuples where each tuple contains elements from the same position in the original tuples.
- The list comprehension `[ (sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples) ]` iterates over these transposed tuples. For each set of values from the same position across all tuples, it calculates their sum and divides by the number of tuples to find the average.
- Finally, the function returns a list of these computed averages.

Given this logic, the function accurately computes the average of corresponding elements from each tuple in the input list of tuples, meeting the requirement stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
