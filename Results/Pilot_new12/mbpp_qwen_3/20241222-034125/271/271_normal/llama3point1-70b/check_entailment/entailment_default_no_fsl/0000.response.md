Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of tuples, computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples, and returns a list of these averages. The code handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list. It also raises a `ValueError` if any tuple in the list has a different length, which aligns with the requirement that all tuples must have the same length. Since the code works for all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints, the program is correct.
