Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over each position in the tuples simultaneously. It then calculates the sum of the values at each position and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach correctly handles the problem description for every potential case, assuming the input is a list of tuples with numeric values and the same length.

The function correctly returns an empty list if the input list is empty. It also correctly raises a `ValueError` if any tuple in the list has a different length, which is handled according to the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs.
