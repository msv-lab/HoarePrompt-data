The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as a parameter, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., April, June, September, or November). If the `month` is one of these, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional actions performed beyond this check. The function does not modify any external variables and only returns a boolean value based on the input.
