Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as a parameter, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., April, June, September, or November). If the `month` is one of these, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional actions performed beyond this check. The function does not modify any external variables and only returns a boolean value based on the input.**

Edge Cases:
- If `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12, the function does not handle this case, and the behavior is undefined. However, since the function only checks if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and does not enforce the range constraint, it will simply return `False` for any `month` that is not 4, 6, 9, or 11.
