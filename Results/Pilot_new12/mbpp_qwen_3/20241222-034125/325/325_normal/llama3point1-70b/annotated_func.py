#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as a parameter, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether the given `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., April, June, September, or November). If the `month` is one of these, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no additional actions performed beyond this check. The function does not modify any external variables and only returns a boolean value based on the input.
