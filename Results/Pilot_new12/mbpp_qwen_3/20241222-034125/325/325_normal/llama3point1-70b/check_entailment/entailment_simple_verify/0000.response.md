Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days based on the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` for month numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11 (which have 30 days) and `False` for other months. Since the function handles all possible valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 12) and matches the expected behavior as described, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
