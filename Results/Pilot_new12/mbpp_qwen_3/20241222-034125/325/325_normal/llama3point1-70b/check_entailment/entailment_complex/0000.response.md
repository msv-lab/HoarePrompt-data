Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`, and checks if the month corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, or November). The function returns `True` if the month is one of these four months and `False` otherwise. The implementation matches the problem description exactly, as it performs no additional actions and only returns a boolean value based on the input month. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
