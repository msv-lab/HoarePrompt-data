Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether the given month number (an integer between 1 and 12) contains 30 days. The function `func_1` creates a list of month numbers that contain 30 days (`[4, 6, 9, 11]`) and returns `True` if the input `month` is found in this list, otherwise it returns `False`. This exactly matches the requirement to check whether the given month number contains 30 days. Therefore, the program is correct.
