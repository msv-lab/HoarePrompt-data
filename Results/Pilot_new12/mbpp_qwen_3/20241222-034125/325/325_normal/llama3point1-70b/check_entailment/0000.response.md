Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. It correctly uses a list of month numbers that have 30 days: `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. For any input month number from 1 to 12, the function will return `True` if the month is in the list and `False` otherwise. This covers all potential cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all possible inputs.
