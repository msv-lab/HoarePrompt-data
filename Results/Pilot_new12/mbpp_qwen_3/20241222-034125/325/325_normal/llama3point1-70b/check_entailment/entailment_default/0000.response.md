Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) by checking if the given month is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`. For any other month, it returns `False`. Given that the problem description specifies that the function should return `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for others, and the output hints confirm this behavior, the code correctly implements the requirement for every potential case within the specified range of month numbers (1 to 12). Therefore, the program is correct.
