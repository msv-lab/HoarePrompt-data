Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days. The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly implements this by checking if the input month (`month`) is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), which are represented by the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the month is one of these and `False` otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no issues or contradictions with the provided annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
