Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function checks whether a given month number contains 30 days by verifying if the month is in the list `[4, 6, 9, 11]`, which accurately represents the months with 30 days. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for the specified months and `False` for others within the range of 1 to 12. Since the program handles all valid inputs correctly according to the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate.
