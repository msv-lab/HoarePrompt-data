Correctness: **False**

The program checks if the given month number is in the list of months with 30 days. However, it does not account for the month of February (month number 2), which does not have 30 days. Additionally, the months with 30 days are correctly identified, but the function should return `True` only for those months. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for every potential case. For example, if the input month is 2, the program will incorrectly return `False`, as February does not have 30 days.
