Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code checks if the given month number is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), which matches the problem description. The code uses a list of month numbers that have 30 days and checks if the input month is in this list. Since the problem description asks to check if the month contains 30 days and the code correctly implements this logic for all valid inputs (1 to 12), the code meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is True.
