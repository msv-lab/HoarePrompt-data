#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks if the given `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., 4, 6, 9, or 11). If the `month` is one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself that need to be handled separately, as the code only checks for the specified months and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the input.
