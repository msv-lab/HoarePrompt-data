Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks if the given `month` is one of the months with 30 days (i.e., 4, 6, 9, or 11). If the `month` is one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation or the code itself that need to be handled separately, as the code only checks for the specified months and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the input.**
