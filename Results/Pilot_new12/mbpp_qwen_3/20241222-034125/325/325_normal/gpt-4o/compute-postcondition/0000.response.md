The code creates a set named `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. These values represent the months that have 30 days. The variable `month` is an integer within the range 1 to 12, but its specific value is not altered by this code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `months_with_30_days` set.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12; `months_with_30_days` is {4, 6, 9, 11}**
