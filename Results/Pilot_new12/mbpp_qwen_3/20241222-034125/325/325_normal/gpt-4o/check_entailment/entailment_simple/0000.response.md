Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether a given month number contains 30 days by using a set of month numbers that have 30 days (i.e., `{4, 6, 9, 11}`). The function `func_1` returns `True` if the given month is one of these numbers, and `False` otherwise. The test cases provided also validate this behavior:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June (month 6) has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February (month 2) typically has 28 or 29 days, not 30.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December (month 12) has 31 days, not 30.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases within the specified range of month numbers (1 to 12).
