Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The provided test cases confirm its correctness:
- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by clearly showing the state of the program before the function call and within the function itself. The function uses a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days and checks if the given month is in this set. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct according to the problem description.
