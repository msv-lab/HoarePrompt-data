Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This logic correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and the months without 30 days (the rest).

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works as expected for all potential cases. The function handles all months from 1 to 12 and correctly identifies which ones have 30 days. There are no missing cases or logical errors in the provided code.
