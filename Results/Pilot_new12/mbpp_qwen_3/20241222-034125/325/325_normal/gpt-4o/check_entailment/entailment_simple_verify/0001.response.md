Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This logic correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and the months without 30 days (the rest). The annotated version of the code supports this understanding and confirms that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases. The test cases provided (`func_1(6) == True`, `func_1(2) == False`, `func_1(12) == False`) also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
