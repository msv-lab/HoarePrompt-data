Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function `func_1` uses a set to store the months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, otherwise it returns `False`. This matches the problem description which states to check if the given month number contains 30 days. The assertions provided also cover the necessary cases (June, February, and December), confirming that the function works as expected for these specific inputs. Since the code handles all the required cases and the output hints align with the provided examples, the program is correct.
