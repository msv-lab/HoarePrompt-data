Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days. The test cases `assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, and `assert func_1(12) == False` cover the relevant months (June has 30 days, February typically does not, and December does not). The function uses a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days and correctly returns `True` for these months and `False` for others. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified range of months (1 to 12) and handles the correct months with 30 days. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being `True` is maintained.
