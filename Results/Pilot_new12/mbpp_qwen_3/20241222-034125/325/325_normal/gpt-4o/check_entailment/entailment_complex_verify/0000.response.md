Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the goal is to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by using a set of month numbers that have 30 days. The annotations support this by stating that the function returns `True` if the month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

Given that the function handles all potential cases correctly and the annotations align with the function's behavior, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
