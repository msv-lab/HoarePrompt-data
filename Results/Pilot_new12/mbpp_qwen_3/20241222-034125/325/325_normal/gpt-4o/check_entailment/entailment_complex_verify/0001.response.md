Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, `assert func_1(12) == False`) are correct and cover the expected behavior of the function. The annotated version confirms that the function handles all months from 1 to 12 correctly and there are no missing cases or logical errors. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
