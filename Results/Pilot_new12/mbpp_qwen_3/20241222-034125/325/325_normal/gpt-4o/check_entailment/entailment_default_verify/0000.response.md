Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not by using a set to store the months with 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases confirm its correctness:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

The output hints also support this, indicating that the function accepts an integer `month` as input within the range 1 to 12 and checks if it is one of the months with 30 days. Since there are no other edge cases mentioned and the function behaves as expected for the given test cases, the program is correct.
