Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

- The function takes an integer `month` as input, which represents a month number between 1 and 12.
- It uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, representing the months that have 30 days.
- The function checks if the given `month` is in the set `months_with_30_days`.
- If the `month` is in the set, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided (`assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, `assert func_1(12) == False`) validate the behavior of the function for different inputs, ensuring that the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without.

Since the function meets the criteria specified in the problem description for all possible valid inputs (months from 1 to 12), the program is correct.
