Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the month numbers that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11). It returns `True` if the input `month` is in this set and `False` otherwise. The provided assertions also match the expected behavior:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June (6) has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February (2) typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December (12) does not have 30 days.

Since the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the provided test cases, the program is correct.
