Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the months that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential month numbers from 1 to 12. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
