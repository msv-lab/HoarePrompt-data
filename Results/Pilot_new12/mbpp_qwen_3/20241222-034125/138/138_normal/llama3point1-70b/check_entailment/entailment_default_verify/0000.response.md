Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index if found, or `-1` if not found. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also accurately summarize the functionality of the code, confirming that the function works as intended under the given assumptions about valid inputs.
