Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index if found, or `-1` if not found. The use of the `index` method ensures that if the element is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block to return the appropriate tuple. The annotations further clarify the behavior of the function, confirming that it handles both cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
