Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for an element in the array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. The code handles all potential outcomes as described in the output hints and the problem description. There are no cases mentioned in the hints or the problem description that this code does not handle correctly under the assumption of valid input.
