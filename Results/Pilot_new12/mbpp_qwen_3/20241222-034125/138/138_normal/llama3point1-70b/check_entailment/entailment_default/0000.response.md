Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It returns a tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array, and the second element is the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The use of `array.index(element)` and handling the `ValueError` exception ensures that all potential cases are handled as described in the output hints. There are no apparent edge cases or examples where the program does not work correctly under the given assumptions about valid input.
