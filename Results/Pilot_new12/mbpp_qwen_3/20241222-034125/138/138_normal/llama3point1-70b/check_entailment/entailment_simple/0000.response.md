Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(array, element)` takes two parameters: an array (`array`) and an element (`element`). This aligns with the problem description that mentions these inputs.

2. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements: a boolean indicating whether the element is found in the array and an integer representing the index of the element or `-1` if the element is not found. This matches the problem description exactly.

3. **Try-Except Block**:
   - The `try` block attempts to find the index of the `element` in the `array` using `array.index(element)`. If the element is found, the function correctly returns `True` and the index.
   - The `except (ValueError)` block handles the scenario where the `element` is not found in the `array`. In this case, it correctly returns `False` and `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Valid Input: For any valid `array` and `element`, the program will correctly return either `(True, index)` or `(False, -1)`.
   - We are instructed to assume that the input will be valid, so cases like invalid input types or empty lists are not considered.

Given these points, the program always adheres to the problem description and thus is correct.
