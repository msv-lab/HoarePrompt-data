Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index if found, or `-1` if not found. The function uses the `index` method of the list, which throws a `ValueError` if the element is not found, and catches this exception to return the appropriate tuple. The annotated version of the code correctly describes the behavior of the function, supporting the original assessment.
