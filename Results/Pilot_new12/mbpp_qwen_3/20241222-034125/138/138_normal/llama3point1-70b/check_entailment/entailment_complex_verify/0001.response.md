Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` and returns a tuple with `True` and the index if the element is found, or `False` and `-1` if the element is not found. The annotations clearly describe the behavior of the function and match the implementation details. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
