Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It searches for the given `element` in the `array`. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught, and the function returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, covering all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
