Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It searches for the given `element` in the `array` and returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element if found, and a tuple with `False` and `-1` if not found. The output hints confirm that the function handles both cases appropriately: finding the element and not finding the element. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, making the original assessment correct.
