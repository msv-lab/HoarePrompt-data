Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of integers or other hashable types) and `element` (an integer or other hashable type). This matches the expected inputs.

2. **Finding the Element**: Inside the `try` block, the program uses `array.index(element)` to find the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is found, it correctly returns `True` and the index of the `element`.

3. **Handling Not Found Case**: The `except ValueError` block catches the error raised when the `element` is not found in the `array`. In this case, it returns `False` and `-1`, which also matches the problem description.

4. **Covering All Cases**: The program covers all possible outcomes as described in the problem statement. It returns `True` and the index if the element is found, and `False` and `-1` if the element is not found.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all cases as required, the program is correct.
