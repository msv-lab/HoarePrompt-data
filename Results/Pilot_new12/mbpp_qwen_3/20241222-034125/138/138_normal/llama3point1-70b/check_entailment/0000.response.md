Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index if found, or `-1` if not found. The function uses the `index` method of the list, which throws a `ValueError` if the element is not found, and catches this exception to return the appropriate tuple. This approach handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
