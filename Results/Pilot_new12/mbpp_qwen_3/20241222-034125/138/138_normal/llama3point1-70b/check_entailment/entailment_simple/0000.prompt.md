You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers or other hashable types, and element is an integer or other hashable type.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns `True` and `index` which is the index of `element` in `array`
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns False and -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array`. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element`. 
    #
    #Summarizing the steps and the output state:
    #
    #- The `try` block attempts to find the index of `element` in `array` using `array.index(element)`.
    #- If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
    #- If the `element` is not found (raises a `ValueError`), the function returns `False` and `-1`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #**The program returns `True` and `index` which is the index of `element` in `array`. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
