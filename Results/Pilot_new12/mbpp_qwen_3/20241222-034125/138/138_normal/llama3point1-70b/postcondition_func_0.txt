The function `func_1` accepts a list `array` and an element `element`. It attempts to find the index of `element` within `array`. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`. This covers all potential outcomes of searching for an element in the list, including the case where the element is not present.
