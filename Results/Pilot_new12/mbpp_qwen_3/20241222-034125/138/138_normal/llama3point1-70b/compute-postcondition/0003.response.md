The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array`. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element`. 

Summarizing the steps and the output state:

- The `try` block attempts to find the index of `element` in `array` using `array.index(element)`.
- If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
- If the `element` is not found (raises a `ValueError`), the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**The program returns `True` and `index` which is the index of `element` in `array`. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`.**
