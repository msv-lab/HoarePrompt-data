Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions confirm that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. 

- The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at each step.
- If the target element is found, it returns `(True, index)`.
- If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The annotations clarify that:
- Before the function call, `arr` is a list of elements and `element` is a value to be searched within the list.
- After the for loop, if the element is found, the function returns `True` and the corresponding index. Otherwise, it returns `False` and the index of the last checked element, which remains `-1`.

The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
