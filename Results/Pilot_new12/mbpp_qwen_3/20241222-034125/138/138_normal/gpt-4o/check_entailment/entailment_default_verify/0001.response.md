Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function iterates through the array and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index. The output hints accurately summarize the function's behavior, confirming that it returns `True` and the index if the element is found, and `False` and the index of the last checked element if the element is not found. The provided test cases also validate this behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is accurate.
