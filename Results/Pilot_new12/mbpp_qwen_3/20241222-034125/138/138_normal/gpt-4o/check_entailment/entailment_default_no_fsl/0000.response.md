Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements the function `func_1` correctly according to the problem description. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the given element and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is found and its index. The code handles all cases where the element is found at any index within the array, as well as the case where the element is not found, returning `(False, -1)`. The assertions provided also cover various scenarios, including finding the element at different indices and not finding it. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described.
