Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `arr` and an element `element`.
2. **Search Logic**: It uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current value (`value`) is equal to the target element (`element`).
4. **Return Value**:
   - If a match is found, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)` indicating that the element was found and providing its index.
   - If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element was not found and returning the index of the last checked element, which is appropriate because `-1` is commonly used to indicate "not found" in such operations.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description for all cases where the input is a valid list and the element is a valid item to search within the list. Thus, the program is correct.
