Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the target element, returning a tuple indicating whether the element was found and its index. The output hints confirm that the function handles all possible cases, including finding the element at different positions within the array and returning `-1` if the element is not found. The examples provided in the original assessment also demonstrate that the function works as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is justified.
