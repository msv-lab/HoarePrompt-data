Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. It iterates through the array, checks for the presence of the element, and returns the appropriate tuple indicating whether the element is present along with its index. The annotated version correctly describes the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the function behaves as expected. There are no discrepancies between the problem description and the implementation, and the provided test cases validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
