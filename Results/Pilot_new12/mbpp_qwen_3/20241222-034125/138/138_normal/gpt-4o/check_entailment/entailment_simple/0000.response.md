Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array (`arr`) and an element (`element`), and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array along with its index. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Functionality**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. If the current value matches the target element, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)` indicating that the element is found at the current index.

2. **Handling Not Found Case**: If the loop completes without finding the element, the function returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element is not found in the array.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions demonstrate different scenarios:
   - Finding an element that exists in the array.
   - Finding an element that is at the end of the array.
   - Finding an element that is in the middle of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a list and a single element), the function handles all expected cases as described in the problem statement.

Since the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
