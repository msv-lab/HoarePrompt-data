Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_1` function meets the requirements of the problem description. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the specified element and returns the correct tuple indicating whether the element was found and its index. The annotated version further clarifies the states and logic flow of the function, supporting the correctness of the original assessment. The function handles all cases where the element is found at any position in the array or not found, returning the appropriate tuple in each scenario. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
