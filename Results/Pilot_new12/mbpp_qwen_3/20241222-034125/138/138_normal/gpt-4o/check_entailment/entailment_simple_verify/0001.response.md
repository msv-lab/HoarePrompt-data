Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes them. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state transitions within the function, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
