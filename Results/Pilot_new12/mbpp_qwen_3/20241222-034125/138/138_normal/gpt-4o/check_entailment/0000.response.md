Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at each step. When it finds the target element, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the problem description. The examples provided also demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given inputs. Given the structure of the program and the examples, there do not appear to be any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
