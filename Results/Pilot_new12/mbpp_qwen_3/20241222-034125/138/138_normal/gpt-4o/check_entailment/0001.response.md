Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function appears to meet the requirements of the problem description. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`. The provided test cases cover several scenarios and the function passes them. Given that the function handles the basic requirement correctly and the provided examples do not reveal any issues, we can conclude that the function works as expected for the described problem.
