Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the current element matches the `element` parameter, it immediately returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns `(False, -1)` indicating that the element was not found. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, including when the element is found at different positions within the list and when the element is not present in the list. Since the code handles all these scenarios correctly, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
