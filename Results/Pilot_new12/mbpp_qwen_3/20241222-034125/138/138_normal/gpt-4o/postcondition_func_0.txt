The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a value `element`. It iterates through the list to check if `element` matches any of the elements in `arr`. If a match is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the matching element. If no match is found, it returns `False` along with the index of the last checked element. The function covers all possible outcomes where the `element` is either found at index 0, 1, or 2, or not found, in which case it returns `False` and the index of the last checked element.
