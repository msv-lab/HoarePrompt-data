Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `arr` is a list with at least one element.
- If the second element in the list (`value`) is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and `index` which is `1`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or returns `None`).

### For Loop
The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.

### Analysis
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The loop starts iterating from the first element of the list.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the loop has not yet found an element matching `element` or the list is not exhausted.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume the loop has just completed its previous iteration.
   - If the function returned during the previous iteration, it means either:
     - The loop did not find the required element, and it has processed all elements up to the second-to-last element (if it exists).
     - Or, it found the required element and returned `True` along with the index.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the next element in the list.
   - The current index is one less than the index of the element found or the last processed index.

### Possible Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: The function has not returned yet, meaning the loop is still processing the list.
  - In this case, the next element to be processed is the next one in the list.
  - The index will be incremented by 1.
- **Scenario 2**: The function has returned, indicating the required element was found.
  - The loop will stop, and no further iterations will occur.

Since we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume Scenario 1.

### Adjusted States
- `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.
- The index is incremented by 1.
- Since the value is derived from the list and the index, the value will also change accordingly.

### Final Answer
State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, index is the current index + 1, and value is the corresponding element in the list**.

Given that the index was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next index will be `2`.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, index is 2, and value is the second element in the list**.
