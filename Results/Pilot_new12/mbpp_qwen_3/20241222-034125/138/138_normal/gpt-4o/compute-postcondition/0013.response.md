Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a value `element`. It iterates through the list to check if `element` matches any of the elements in `arr`. If a match is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the matching element. If no match is found, it returns `False` along with the index of the last checked element. The function covers all possible outcomes where the `element` is either found at index 0, 1, or 2, or not found, in which case it returns `False` and the index of the last checked element.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where the `element` is found at any index within the list, returning `True` and the respective index.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the `element` is not found, returning `False` and the index of the last checked element.
- However, the annotation mentions specific indices (0, 1, or 2), but the function can potentially find the `element` at any index in the list, not just these three specific positions. Therefore, the function should be more general and not limit the returned index to these specific values.
- The function returns `False` and the index of the last checked element, which means if the list is empty or the element is not found, the index will be the length of the list minus one, as `enumerate` starts indexing from 0.
