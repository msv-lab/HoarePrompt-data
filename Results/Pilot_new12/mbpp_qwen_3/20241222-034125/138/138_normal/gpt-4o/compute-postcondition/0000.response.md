State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value of the same type as the elements in `arr`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop uses `enumerate(arr)`, which means it iterates over the indices and values of the list `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.
3. At the start of the loop, the index should be 0 and the value should be the first element in the list.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states to reflect these conditions:

- `arr` must have at least one element.
- The index (`index`) must be 0.
- The value (`value`) must be the first element in the list (`arr[0]`).

State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the list**
