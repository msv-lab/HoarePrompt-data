The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a value of the same type as the elements in `arr`. The function returns either `True` and an index (0, 1, or 2) or `False` and an index (the index of the last checked element).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and a value `element`, and return `True` along with the index 0, 1, or 2 if `element` matches the corresponding element in `arr` at those indices. Otherwise, it returns `False` along with the index of the last checked element.
