Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not actually perform a full sorting operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it only ensures that the last element of the list is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements. This means that the list is not fully sorted, and the output will not match the expected results for larger lists or more complex cases. For example, consider the following input:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

Expected output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (fully sorted)

However, the current implementation will only ensure that the last element is the maximum among the first four elements, which is not sufficient for a fully sorted list. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
