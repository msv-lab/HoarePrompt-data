You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements (can be of any type that supports comparison).
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements where the first `n-1` elements are in their original order; the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element; `curr_size` is 1; `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `1` element of `arr` (which is just the last element).
    return arr
    #`arr' where the last element is swapped with the maximum element in the first '1' element of 'arr', 'curr_size' is 1, and 'max_index' is the index of the maximum element in the first '1' element of 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and returns a modified list `arr'`. After executing the function, the last element of the list is swapped with the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list, where `n` is the length of the list. The variable `curr_size` is set to 1, indicating that only one element is being considered in the final step. The variable `max_index` is the index of the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list. If the maximum element is already in its correct position (i.e., the last position), no swap occurs. This process effectively ensures that the last element of the list is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements. The function handles edge cases where the list might be empty or contain a single element, in which case no action is performed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements (can be of any type), and end is an integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `arr` is reversed, `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is equal to its original value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `flip(end)` takes a list `arr` and an integer `end` as input and reverses the elements in `arr` from the beginning up to the index `end`. After the function execution, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `end` will be reversed, `start` will be equal to `end + 1`, and `end` will retain its original value. If `end` is less than half the length of `arr`, only the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed. If `end` is exactly half the length of `arr`, the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed, and the rest of the list will remain unchanged.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings), and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that 1 <= n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is a positive integer, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, and `i` is `n`.
    return max_index
    #`The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the list `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` to find the index of the maximum element. If the list `arr` is empty or `n` is less than 1, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the loop will not execute. After finding the index of the maximum element, the function returns this index. The function ensures that the returned index is valid within the bounds of the list `arr`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
