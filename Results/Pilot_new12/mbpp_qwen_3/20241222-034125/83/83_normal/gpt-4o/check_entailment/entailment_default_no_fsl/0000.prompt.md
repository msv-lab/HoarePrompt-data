You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and returns a modified list `arr'`. After executing the function, the last element of the list is swapped with the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list, where `n` is the length of the list. The variable `curr_size` is set to 1, indicating that only one element is being considered in the final step. The variable `max_index` is the index of the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list. If the maximum element is already in its correct position (i.e., the last position), no swap occurs. This process effectively ensures that the last element of the list is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements. The function handles edge cases where the list might be empty or contain a single element, in which case no action is performed.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip(end)` takes a list `arr` and an integer `end` as input and reverses the elements in `arr` from the beginning up to the index `end`. After the function execution, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `end` will be reversed, `start` will be equal to `end + 1`, and `end` will retain its original value. If `end` is less than half the length of `arr`, only the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed. If `end` is exactly half the length of `arr`, the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed, and the rest of the list will remain unchanged.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the list `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` to find the index of the maximum element. If the list `arr` is empty or `n` is less than 1, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the loop will not execute. After finding the index of the maximum element, the function returns this index. The function ensures that the returned index is valid within the bounds of the list `arr`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
