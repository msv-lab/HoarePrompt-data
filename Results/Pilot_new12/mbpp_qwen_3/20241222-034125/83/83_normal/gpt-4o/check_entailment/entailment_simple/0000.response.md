Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the sorting functionality as described in the problem statement. Instead of sorting the entire list, the code seems to be attempting a partial sorting approach which does not guarantee a fully sorted list.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that sorts a list of elements.
2. **Given Code**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over a range from `n` down to `2` (inclusive) and performs swaps based on finding the maximum element in the current subarray.
   - However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly sort the list. It only ensures that the largest element in the current subarray is moved to the end of the array without ensuring the rest of the subarray is sorted.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect Sorting Logic**: The code only moves the maximum element to the end of the current subarray in each iteration. This does not ensure that the entire list is sorted.
- **No Full Sort**: After the loop completes, the list might not be fully sorted. For instance, the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element in each iteration, but the rest of the elements are not guaranteed to be in the correct order.

### Example:

Consider the input `[4, 3, 2, 1]`:
- In the first iteration, the maximum element is `4` at index `0`, so it is swapped with the last element `1`. The array becomes `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
- In the second iteration, the maximum element is `3` at index `1`, so it is swapped with the last element `4`. The array becomes `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- In the third iteration, the maximum element is `4` at index `1`, so it is swapped with the last element `3`. The array becomes `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.

Clearly, the list is not sorted after these iterations.

### Conclusion:

Since the provided code does not sort the entire list as required, the program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
