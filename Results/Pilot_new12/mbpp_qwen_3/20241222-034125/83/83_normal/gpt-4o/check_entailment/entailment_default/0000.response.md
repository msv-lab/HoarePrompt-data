Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not implement a proper sorting algorithm. The provided functions and their output hints suggest that the intended approach is to repeatedly find the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array and move it to the end of that portion. However, this approach does not guarantee a fully sorted array after each iteration. For example:

- Given the list `[1, 3, 2]`, the function `func_1` would first find the maximum element `3` at index `1` and move it to the end, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. The next iteration would then find the maximum element `2` at index `0` and move it to the end, resulting in `[2, 1, 3]`, which is not sorted.

This approach fails to ensure that the entire list is sorted after each pass, and thus, the code does not correctly implement the sorting functionality described in the problem statement.
