Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list using a series of flips based on finding the maximum element in the current subarray. However, there is a logical issue in the `func_1` function that makes the sorting incomplete. Specifically, the loop in `func_1` starts from `n` and goes down to `2`, but it does not handle the case when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The function will start with `curr_size = 4` and find the maximum index (which is `0`), then it will flip `0` and `3`, resulting in `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. Then it will proceed with `curr_size = 3`, which is unnecessary since the array is already partially sorted. This means the function does not guarantee a fully sorted array in all cases.

To ensure correctness, the loop in `func_1` should start from `n-1` and go down to `2`, and after each iteration, it should check if the array is already sorted. If the array is sorted, the function should break out of the loop early.
