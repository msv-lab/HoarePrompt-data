Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` aims to sort a list by ensuring the last element is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements, but it only performs a single pass to find the maximum element and swap it with the last element. This approach does not guarantee that the entire list is sorted.

For instance, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. According to the problem description, the expected output is a fully sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. However, the current implementation will only ensure that the last element is the maximum among the first four elements, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` which is already correct in this specific case, but it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the entire list is sorted.

A correct implementation of a sorting algorithm would typically involve multiple passes or a more comprehensive swapping mechanism to place elements in their correct positions. The current implementation is incomplete and does not meet the full requirements of the problem description.
