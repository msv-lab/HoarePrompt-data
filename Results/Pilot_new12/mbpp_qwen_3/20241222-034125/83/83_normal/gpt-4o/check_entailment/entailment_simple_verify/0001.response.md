Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not guarantee a fully sorted array in all cases due to the logical issue in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the loop in `func_1` starts from `n` and goes down to `2`, but it does not handle the case when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted. This results in unnecessary operations and does not ensure that the array is fully sorted in all scenarios. For instance, considering the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function performs an unnecessary flip operation, leading to an unsorted array after the first iteration. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies that the program is not fully correct based on the given problem description.
