State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list, `max_index` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the range will not generate any values, and the loop will not execute.
3. The initial value of `i` in the loop is 1, as specified by the range function.

Given this, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
