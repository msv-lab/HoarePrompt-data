Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements where the first `n-1` elements are in their original order; the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element; if `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, then the elements from `max_index` to the end of the array are in their original order and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `k-2` elements of the array. If `max_index` is equal to `curr_size - 1`, there are no additional changes to the array or `max_index`.**
