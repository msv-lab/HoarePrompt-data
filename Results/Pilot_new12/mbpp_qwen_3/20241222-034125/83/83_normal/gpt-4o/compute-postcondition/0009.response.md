The code `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. The initial state shows that `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `max_index` is now equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `max_index` is `n`.**
