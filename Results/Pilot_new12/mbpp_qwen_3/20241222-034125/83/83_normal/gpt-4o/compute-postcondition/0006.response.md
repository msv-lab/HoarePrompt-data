`max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `max_index` was either 0 or 1 depending on the condition `arr[1] > arr[max_index]`. Since `i` is now 2, the value of `max_index` is updated to 2. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is 2, and `i` is 2.**
