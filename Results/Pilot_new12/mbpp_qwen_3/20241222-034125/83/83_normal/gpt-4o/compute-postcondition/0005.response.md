Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `max_index` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `arr[i] > arr[max_index]` is true or false.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the range `1 to n-1`.

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- Therefore, we are currently checking if `i == 1`.

### Next Iteration:
For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is now 2, we need to check if `2 < n` to determine if the loop should continue.
- The value of `max_index` does not change based on the current iteration since `i` was already set to 1 in the previous iteration.

### Updated State:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `max_index` remains either 0 or 1.
- `i` becomes 2.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether `arr[1] > arr[max_index]` is true or false), and `i` is 2.**
