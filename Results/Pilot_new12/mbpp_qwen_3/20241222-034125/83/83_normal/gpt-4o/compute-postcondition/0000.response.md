The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_index`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `arr` remains a list of comparable elements, `n` remains the integer representing the length of the list, and `max_index` is now `0`.

Output State: **arr is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list, `max_index` is 0**
