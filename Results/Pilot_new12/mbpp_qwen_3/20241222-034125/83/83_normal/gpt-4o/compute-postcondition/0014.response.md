Functionality: **The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the list `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` to find the index of the maximum element. If the list `arr` is empty or `n` is less than 1, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the loop will not execute. After finding the index of the maximum element, the function returns this index. The function ensures that the returned index is valid within the bounds of the list `arr`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than 1, the function will attempt to access an invalid index, leading to an `IndexError`.
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function will also attempt to access an invalid index, resulting in an `IndexError`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 1 explicitly. In this case, the function would return 0, which is technically correct but might not be desirable if the caller expects the function to handle edge cases more gracefully.
