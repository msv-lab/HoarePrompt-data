Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and returns a modified list `arr'`. After executing the function, the last element of the list is swapped with the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list, where `n` is the length of the list. The variable `curr_size` is set to 1, indicating that only one element is being considered in the final step. The variable `max_index` is the index of the maximum element among the first `n-1` elements of the list. If the maximum element is already in its correct position (i.e., the last position), no swap occurs. This process effectively ensures that the last element of the list is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements. The function handles edge cases where the list might be empty or contain a single element, in which case no action is performed.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the potential edge cases and any missing context from the annotations.
