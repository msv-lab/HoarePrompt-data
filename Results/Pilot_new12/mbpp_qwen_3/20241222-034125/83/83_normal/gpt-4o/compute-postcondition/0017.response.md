Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements where the first `n-1` elements are in their original order; the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element; `curr_size` is 1; `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `1` element of `arr` (which is just the last element).**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.
2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
       max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
       if max_index != curr_size - 1:
           flip(max_index)
           flip(curr_size - 1)
   ```
3. **Observations from Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration, the first `n-1` elements are reversed compared to their initial order, and the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element.
   - After 2 iterations, the first `n-1` elements are back in their original order, and the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element again.
   - After 3 iterations, the first `n-1` elements remain in their original order, and the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element, ensuring the last element is the maximum among the first `n-1` elements.

4. **Final Iteration Analysis**:
   - When `curr_size` reaches 1, the loop condition `range(n, 1, -1)` is no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates.
   - At this point, `curr_size` is 1, meaning the last element (index `n-1`) is being considered.
   - `max_index` is determined as the index of the maximum element in the first `1` element, which is just the last element itself.
   - No further swaps occur because `curr_size` is 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The first `n-1` elements of `arr` remain in their original order.
   - The last element (`arr[n-1]`) is the maximum element among the entire array, and it might have been swapped with the last element during the process, but since the loop terminates when `curr_size` is 1, the last element remains in its final position.

Thus, the final output state is that `arr` is a list of elements where the first `n-1` elements are in their original order, the element at `max_index` is swapped with the last element, `curr_size` is 1, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `1` element of `arr`.
