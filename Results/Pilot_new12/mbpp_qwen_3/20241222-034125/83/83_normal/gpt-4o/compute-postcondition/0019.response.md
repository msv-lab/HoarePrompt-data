The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements (can be of any type that supports comparison). The function returns a modified list `arr'` where the last element is swapped with the maximum element in the first '1' element of `arr`, along with `curr_size` set to 1 and `max_index` set to the index of the maximum element in the first '1' element of `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return a modified list `arr'`, along with two additional values `curr_size` and `max_index`, based on the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr`, returns a modified list `arr'`, and two additional values `curr_size` and `max_index`.**
