The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. The previous value of `max_index` was 0, and now it is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1.**
