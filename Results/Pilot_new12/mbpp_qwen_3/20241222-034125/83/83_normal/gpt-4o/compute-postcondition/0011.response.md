Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is a positive integer, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, and `i` is `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 to `n-1`.
- During each iteration, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`.
- If it finds an element greater than the current `arr[max_index]`, it updates `max_index` to the current index `i`.
- After the loop completes, `max_index` will hold the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0 or the list `arr` is empty), the initial state remains:
- `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
- `n` is 0.
- `max_index` is 0 (as it was initially set).
