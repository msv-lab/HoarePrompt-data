Functionality: **The function `flip(end)` takes a list `arr` and an integer `end` as input and reverses the elements in `arr` from the beginning up to the index `end`. After the function execution, the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `end` will be reversed, `start` will be equal to `end + 1`, and `end` will retain its original value. If `end` is less than half the length of `arr`, only the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed. If `end` is exactly half the length of `arr`, the first `end + 1` elements will be reversed, and the rest of the list will remain unchanged.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `end` is 0, the function will reverse the first element only, and the rest of the list will remain unchanged.
- If `end` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one, the entire list will be reversed.
- If `end` is negative or greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, the function will not modify `arr` and will leave it as is, which is an out-of-bound access that is handled implicitly by the code.
