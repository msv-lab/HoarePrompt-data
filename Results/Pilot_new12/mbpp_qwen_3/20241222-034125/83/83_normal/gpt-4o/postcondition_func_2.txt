The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the list `arr`. It iterates through the list `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` to find the index of the maximum element. If the list `arr` is empty or `n` is less than 1, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the loop will not execute. After finding the index of the maximum element, the function returns this index. The function ensures that the returned index is valid within the bounds of the list `arr`.
