Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list using a custom algorithm, but it does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible edge cases and does not guarantee that the list will be sorted after execution. 

For instance, consider the input list `[2, 3, 1]`. The program will not sort this list correctly:

1. In the first iteration, `size` starts at 3 (the length of the list).
   - `max(arr[:3])` returns 3 (index 1).
   - Since `max_index` is 1 and `size - 1` is 2, the condition `max_index != size - 1` is true.
   - The subarray from index 0 to 1 (`arr[:max_index + 1]`) is reversed, resulting in `[3, 2]`.
   - The subarray from index 0 to 3 (`arr[:size]`) is reversed, resulting in `[3, 2, 1]`.

The list is not sorted after the first iteration, and subsequent iterations do not correct this mistake. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of sorting a list for every potential case.
