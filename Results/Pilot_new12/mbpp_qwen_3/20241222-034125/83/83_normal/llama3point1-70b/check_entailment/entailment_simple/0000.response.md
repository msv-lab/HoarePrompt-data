Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the sorting of a list of elements. The logic used in the program seems to be attempting to reverse parts of the array, but this approach does not guarantee that the list will be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `n` is set to the length of the list `arr`.

2. **For Loop**: The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`. In each iteration, it finds the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: 
   - If the maximum element is not at the end of the current sublist (`max_index != size - 1`), the program performs two reversals:
     - Reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements.
     - Reverses the first `size` elements.
   
4. **Post-Loop State**: After the loop, the state of the program is supposed to have `arr` as a sorted list in non-decreasing order, with `n` being the length of `arr`, and `size` being 1.

### Why It Does Not Work:
- **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: Reversing the first `max_index + 1` elements and then reversing the first `size` elements does not ensure that the maximum element is placed in its correct position within the list. This approach can lead to incorrect ordering of elements.

- **Example Counter-Case**:
  Consider the list `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - First iteration (size = 3): Maximum is 3, located at index 0. The program would reverse the entire list, resulting in `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - Second iteration (size = 2): Maximum is 2, located at index 2. The program would reverse the first 3 elements, resulting in `[2, 1, 3]`.
  - Third iteration (size = 1): No action is taken since the list is already partially sorted.

The final output `[2, 1, 3]` is not a sorted list in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach to sort a list could involve using a well-known sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc. For instance, a simple selection sort could be implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr
```

This implementation ensures that the smallest element is moved to the beginning of the unsorted portion of the list in each iteration, leading to a sorted list.

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the problem description and hence is marked as **False**.
