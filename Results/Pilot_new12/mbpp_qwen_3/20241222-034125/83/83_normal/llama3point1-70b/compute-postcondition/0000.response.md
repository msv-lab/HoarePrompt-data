The code assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The length of the list `arr` is calculated, which means `n` will hold an integer value representing the number of elements in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`**
