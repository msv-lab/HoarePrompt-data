`max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, the sublist is the entire list `arr`. The value of `max_index` depends on the content of `arr`. However, the values of `arr`, `n`, and `size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`**
