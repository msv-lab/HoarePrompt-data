Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list where the first `n` elements are reversed, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `n` elements of `arr`. If `max_index` is not 0, then the first `max_index + 1` elements are further reversed. Otherwise, the list remains unchanged.***
