The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. Given the initial state where the first `n` elements of `arr` are reversed and `size` is `n`, this operation will reverse the first `n` elements again, effectively restoring them to their original order. The `max_index` remains unchanged because the reversal of the first `n` elements does not affect the relative positions of the elements.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list where the first `n` elements are in their original order, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
