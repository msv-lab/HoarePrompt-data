Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. If `max_index` is not the last index (`size - 1`), then `arr` is the reversed version of the original list, and `max_index` is adjusted accordingly. If `max_index` is the last index, the original `max_index` remains unchanged.***
