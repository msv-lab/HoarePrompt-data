State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range from `n` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop variable `size` will take values from `n` down to `1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State Needed for the Loop**: For the loop to execute, the initial value of `size` should be at least `1` because the loop continues as long as `size` is greater than `0`. The variable `n` determines the starting point of the loop.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `n` is the length of `arr`, and the loop starts at `n` and decrements until `1`, the initial value of `size` should be `n`. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at all.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `size` must start at `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
