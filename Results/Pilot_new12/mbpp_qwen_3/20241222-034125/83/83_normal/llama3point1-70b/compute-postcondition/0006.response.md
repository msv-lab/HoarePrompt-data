Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed. `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the modified `arr`. Regardless of the condition, `max_index` is neither `size - 1` nor `0`.***
