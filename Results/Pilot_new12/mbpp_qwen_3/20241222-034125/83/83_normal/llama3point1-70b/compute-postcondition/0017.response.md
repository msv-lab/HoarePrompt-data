The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements of the list `arr`. The `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `n` elements of `arr`. Since the first `n` elements are reversed, the maximum value will now be at the beginning of these elements (index `0`), and the rest will be in reverse order.

Given this, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` will be reversed. However, since `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `n` elements, after reversing, the first element of the subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]` will be the maximum value, and the rest will follow in reverse order.

Output State: **`arr` is a list where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `n` elements of `arr`**.
