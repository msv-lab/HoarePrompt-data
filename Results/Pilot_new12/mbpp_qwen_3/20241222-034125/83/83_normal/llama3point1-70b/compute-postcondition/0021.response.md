Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list in non-decreasing order, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `size` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
  - **Initial State:** `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.
  - **Loop Execution:**
    - The loop starts with `size = n` and decreases `size` by 1 each iteration until `size` reaches 1.
    - For each `size`, it finds the index of the maximum element in the sublist `arr[:size]` and checks if this index is not `size - 1`.
    - If `max_index` is not `size - 1`, it reverses the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` and then reverses the entire sublist `arr[:size]`.
    - If `max_index` is `size - 1`, no reversal occurs for that specific `size`.

- **After the Loop Executes:**
  - After all iterations, the largest element in the list will be at the end, the second largest at the second last position, and so on.
  - This process continues until the smallest element is in its correct position.
  - Therefore, the final state of `arr` is a sorted list in non-decreasing order.
  - The value of `n` remains the same as the length of `arr`.
  - The value of `size` at the end of the loop is 1, as the loop stops when `size` becomes 1.

- **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute:**
  - If `n` is 0, the list `arr` is empty, and no changes occur.
  - The state of `arr` and `n` remains the same.

Thus, after all the iterations of the loop, `arr` is guaranteed to be a sorted list in non-decreasing order.
