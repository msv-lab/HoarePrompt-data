Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` as a parameter and returns the same list sorted in non-decreasing order. It achieves this by iterating over the list in reverse order of sizes, finding the maximum element within each size range, and reversing the appropriate segments of the list to ensure the maximum element moves towards the beginning of the current segment. If the maximum element is not already in the correct position, it reverses the segment up to the maximum index. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Potential edge cases include lists with duplicate elements, empty lists, or lists with a single element, all of which are handled correctly by the function.**

This summary covers the core functionality of the function based on the actual code, includes the return type and its sorted state, and addresses any implicit handling of edge cases.
