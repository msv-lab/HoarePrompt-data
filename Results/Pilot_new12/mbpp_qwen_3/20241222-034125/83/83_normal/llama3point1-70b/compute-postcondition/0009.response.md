According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. The loop iterates from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. If `max_index` is not the last index (`size - 1`), then `arr` is the reversed version of the original list, and `max_index` is adjusted accordingly. If `max_index` is the last index, the original `max_index` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrease `size` by 1 since the loop decrements `size` from `n` down to 1. Therefore, `size` will be `n - 1`.

Let's summarize the updated state:

- `arr` remains the same list of elements.
- `n` remains the length of `arr` and must still be greater than 0.
- `size` is now `n - 1`.
- `max_index` remains unchanged because it only changes if `max_index` is not the last index, but for the next iteration, this condition will be checked with the new `size`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`.**
