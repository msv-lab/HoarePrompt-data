Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list where the first `n` elements are either in their original order or reversed, depending on the value of `max_index`. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, the first `n` elements are in their original order. If `max_index` equals `size - 1`, the first `n` elements are reversed.***
