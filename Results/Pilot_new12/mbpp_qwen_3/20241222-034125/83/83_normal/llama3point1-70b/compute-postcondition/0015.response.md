To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is that `arr` is a list where the first `size` elements (or all elements if `max_index` is 0) are reversed.

2. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `size` from `n` down to `1`. This means that `size` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new values for `arr` and `size` for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Determine Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `size` in the current iteration was `n + 1` (since it starts from `n` and decrements by 1 each time).
   - In the next iteration, `size` will be `n`.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the reversal operation only happens when the loop starts (at `size = n`).

5. **Update States**:
   - Since `size` is now `n`, we need to reverse the first `n` elements of `arr`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `size` must be greater than `0`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated states are:

- `arr` should still be the list where the first `n` elements are reversed.
- `size` should be `n` since it will decrement to `n-1` in the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list where the first `n` elements are reversed, `size` is `n`**.
