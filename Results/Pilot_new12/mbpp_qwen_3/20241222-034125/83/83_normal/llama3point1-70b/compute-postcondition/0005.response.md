The code snippet `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist from the beginning of the list up to and including the element at index `max_index`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of elements,
- `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0,
- `size` is `n`,
- `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` (and `max_index` is neither `size - 1` nor `0`).

After executing the code:
- The sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed. This means that the first `max_index + 1` elements of the list `arr` are now in reverse order compared to their original positions.

Since the exact elements and their values are not specified, we can only describe the change in the order of the elements:

Output State: **`arr` is a list where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the modified `arr` and it is neither `size - 1` nor `0`**.
