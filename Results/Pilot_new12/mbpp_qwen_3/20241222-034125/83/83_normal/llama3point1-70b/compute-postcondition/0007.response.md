The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, it means the entire list `arr` is reversed. Given that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the modified `arr` and is neither `size - 1` (which is `n - 1`) nor `0`, the value of `max_index` remains unchanged because reversing the list does not affect the relative position of its elements.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `arr` is now the reversed version of the original list.
- `n` is the length of the list, which remains unchanged.
- `size` is still equal to `n`.
- `max_index` is still the index of the maximum element in the modified `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is the reversed version of the original list, `n` is the length of `arr`, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the modified `arr`.**
