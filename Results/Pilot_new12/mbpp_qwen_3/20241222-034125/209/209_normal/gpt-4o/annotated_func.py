#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists (where each element is a sublist).
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original lst
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original `lst`. The function does not modify the original list and handles edge cases such as empty sublists or an empty list of sublists. If any sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. If the input `lst` itself is empty, the function returns an empty list.
