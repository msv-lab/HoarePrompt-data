Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function accepts a list of lists and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The annotations mention that if any sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`, but this does not affect the correctness of the function for the given problem description, which does not mention handling empty sublists explicitly. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
