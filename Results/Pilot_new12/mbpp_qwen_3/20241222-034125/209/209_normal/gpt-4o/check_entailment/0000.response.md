Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works as expected. For any list of sublists, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This approach handles various scenarios, including different lengths of sublists and multiple levels of nesting (though this particular function only deals with one level). Since the function meets the requirements for the given test cases and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
