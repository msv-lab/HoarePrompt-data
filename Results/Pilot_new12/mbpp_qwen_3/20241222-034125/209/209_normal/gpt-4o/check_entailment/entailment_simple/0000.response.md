Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The provided code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extracts the first element of each sublist. The assertions at the beginning of the program confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the program meets the requirement to get the first element of each sublist for any valid input list of lists, it is correct.
