Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The code uses a list comprehension to achieve this. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases such as empty sublists and an empty list of sublists appropriately. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the constraints provided.
