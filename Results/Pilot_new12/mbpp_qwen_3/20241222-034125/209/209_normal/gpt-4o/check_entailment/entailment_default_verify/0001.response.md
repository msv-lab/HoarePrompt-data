Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist as demonstrated by the assertions. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling edge cases such as empty sublists or an empty list of sublists by returning `None` for empty sublists and an empty list for an empty input list. Since the problem description asks for getting the first element of each sublist and the code and assertions align with this requirement, the program is correct.
