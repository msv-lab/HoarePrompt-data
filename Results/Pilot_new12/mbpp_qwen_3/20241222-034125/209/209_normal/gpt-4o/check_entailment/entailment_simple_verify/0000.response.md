Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist as demonstrated by the test cases. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function iterates through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. Given the test cases and the logical flow described in the annotations, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned that would indicate the program is incorrect.
