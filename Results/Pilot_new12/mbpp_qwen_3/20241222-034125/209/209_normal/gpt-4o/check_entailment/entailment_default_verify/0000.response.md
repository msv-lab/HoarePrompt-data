Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as empty sublists or an empty list of sublists appropriately. Since the function meets the requirements for the given test cases and there are no apparent issues with the implementation, the program is correct. The original assessment accurately reflects the functionality and correctness of the provided code.
