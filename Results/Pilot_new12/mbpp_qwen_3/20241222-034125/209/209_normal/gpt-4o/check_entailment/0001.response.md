Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. The examples given also demonstrate this functionality:

1. `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]` returns `[1, 3, 6]`.
2. `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]` returns `[1, 4]`.
3. `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]` returns `[9, 1]`.

The list comprehension used in the function iterates over each sublist in the input list and selects the first element (`sublist[0]`). This approach works for any list of sublists, as long as each sublist contains at least one element. Since no edge cases or invalid inputs are mentioned in the problem description, and the function works correctly for the given assertions, the program is correct.
