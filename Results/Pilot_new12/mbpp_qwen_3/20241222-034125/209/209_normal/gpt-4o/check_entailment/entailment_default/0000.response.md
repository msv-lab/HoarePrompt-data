Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lst`) and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The examples given match the expected behavior:

- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`.
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`.
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`.

The list comprehension used in the function `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` correctly extracts the first element of each sublist. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and no edge cases are mentioned that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
