Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The list comprehension iterates through each sublist and extracts the first element, which satisfies the problem description for all potential cases. Since the function works as expected for any list of sublists, the program is correct.
