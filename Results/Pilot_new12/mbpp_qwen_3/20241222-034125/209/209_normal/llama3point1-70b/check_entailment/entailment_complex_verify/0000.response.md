Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each sublist and extracts the first element, which aligns with the problem description. Although the annotated version mentions that if a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will be an empty value, this still satisfies the requirement of returning the first element of each sublist. The function handles all potential cases where each sublist contains at least one element or is empty, and it returns an empty list if `sublists` itself is an empty list. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
