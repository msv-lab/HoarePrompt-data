Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` meets the problem description of getting the first element of each sublist. The output hints further clarify that the function handles cases where sublists may be empty by returning an empty value at the corresponding position. The function does not need to handle cases where `sublists` is an empty list separately because the list comprehension will naturally produce an empty list in such a scenario, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
