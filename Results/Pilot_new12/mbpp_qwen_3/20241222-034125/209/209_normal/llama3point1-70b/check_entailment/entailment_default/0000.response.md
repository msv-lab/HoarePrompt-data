Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists and returns a list containing the first element from each sublist. The code handles cases where sublists are empty by returning an empty value in the corresponding position. Additionally, the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or an empty list because the problem description assumes valid input. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
