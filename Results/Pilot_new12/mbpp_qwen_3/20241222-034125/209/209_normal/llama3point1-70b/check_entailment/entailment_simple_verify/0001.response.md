Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the first element of each sublist within the input list `sublists`. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each sublist in the input and extracts the first element from each, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
