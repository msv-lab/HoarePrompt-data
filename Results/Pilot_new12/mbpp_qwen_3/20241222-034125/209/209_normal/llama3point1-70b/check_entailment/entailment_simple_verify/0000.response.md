Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The annotation specifies that `sublists` is a list of sublists (where each sublist can be any iterable), and the function iterates over each sublist to extract the first element using list comprehension. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to get the first element of each sublist. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
