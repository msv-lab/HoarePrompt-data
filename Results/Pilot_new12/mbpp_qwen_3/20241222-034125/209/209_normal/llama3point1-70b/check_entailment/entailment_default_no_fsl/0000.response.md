Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The function works for all potential cases described in the problem description, including sublists that are empty, which results in an empty value in the output list. The function also handles the case where `sublists` itself is an empty list, returning an empty list as specified. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that indicate the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
