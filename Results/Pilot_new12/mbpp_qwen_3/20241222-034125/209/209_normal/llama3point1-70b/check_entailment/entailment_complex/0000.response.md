Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a list containing the first element from each sublist. This matches the problem description exactly. Additionally, the annotation correctly states that if a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will be an empty value, which is the expected behavior. The function also handles the case where `sublists` is an empty list by returning an empty list, as mentioned in the annotation. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
