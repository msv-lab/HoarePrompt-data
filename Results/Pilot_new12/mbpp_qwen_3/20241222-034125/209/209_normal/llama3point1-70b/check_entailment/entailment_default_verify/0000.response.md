Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to get the first element of each sublist. The list comprehension iterates over each sublist in the input list and retrieves the first element. This meets the problem description. The output hints confirm this behavior and indicate that the function handles cases where sublists are empty by returning an empty value in the corresponding position. The function also correctly returns an empty list if the input list itself is empty, which is consistent with the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
