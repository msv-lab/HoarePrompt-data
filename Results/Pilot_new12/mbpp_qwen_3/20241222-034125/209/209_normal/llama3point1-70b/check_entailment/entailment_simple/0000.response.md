Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists (`sublists`) as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- The function accepts a single parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of sublists.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `sublists`.
- For each sublist, it accesses the first element (`sublist[0]`).
- Finally, it returns a new list containing these first elements.

Since the program accurately performs the task described in the problem statement, it is correct.
