Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to get the first element of each sublist. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each sublist to return its first element, and it handles cases where a sublist might be empty by returning an empty value in those positions. Since the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases beyond getting the first element of each sublist, and the function performs exactly as described, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
