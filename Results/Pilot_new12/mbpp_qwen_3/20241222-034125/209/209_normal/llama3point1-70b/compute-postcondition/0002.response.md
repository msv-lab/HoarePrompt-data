Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of sublists (`sublists`), where each sublist can be any iterable. It returns a list containing the first element from each sublist. If a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will be an empty value. The function does not handle cases where `sublists` itself is an empty list; in such a case, it returns an empty list.**
