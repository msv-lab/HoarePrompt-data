#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of sublists (where each sublist can be any iterable).
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list of the first elements from each sublist in the list 'sublists'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of sublists (`sublists`), where each sublist can be any iterable. It returns a list containing the first element from each sublist. If a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will be an empty value. The function does not handle cases where `sublists` itself is an empty list; in such a case, it returns an empty list.
