According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `sorted_list`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element.
- If `sorted_list[i]` (which is `sorted_list[1]` in the context of this problem) is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns 1 and the loop stops.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `sorted_list`, and `sorted_list[i]` must be less than `value`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` is currently 1, then `i` needs to be 2 for the loop to continue. Therefore, the condition `i < len(sorted_list)` must hold true for `i = 2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element.
- `i` must be 2.
- `value` is a value that is greater than `sorted_list[1]` to cause the function to return 1 and stop the loop, otherwise it can be any value that allows the loop to continue.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element, `i` is 2, `value` is a value that is less than `sorted_list[2]`**
