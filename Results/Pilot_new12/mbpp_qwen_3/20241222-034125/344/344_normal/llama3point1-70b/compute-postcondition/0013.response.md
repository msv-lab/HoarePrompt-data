Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` (a list of integers or floats) and a value `value` (an integer or float). It returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list `sorted_list`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return 0 because the for loop will not execute, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is 0.
- The function does not check whether `value` is an integer or float; it assumes `value` is valid as per the input requirements.
- The function does not handle cases where `sorted_list` contains duplicate values. It simply returns the index of the first occurrence of an element that is greater than or equal to `value`.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs, such as if `sorted_list` is not a list or `value` is not an integer or float.
