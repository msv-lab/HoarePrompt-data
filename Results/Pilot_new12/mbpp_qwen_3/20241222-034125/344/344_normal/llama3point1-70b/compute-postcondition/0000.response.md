According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_list`. For the loop to execute, `sorted_list` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.

Before the loop starts, we know the following:
- `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `value` is an integer or float.

The key point here is that the loop will execute if `sorted_list` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `sorted_list` has at least one element, and `i` is set to 0 (the initial value before the loop starts).

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least one element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 0**
