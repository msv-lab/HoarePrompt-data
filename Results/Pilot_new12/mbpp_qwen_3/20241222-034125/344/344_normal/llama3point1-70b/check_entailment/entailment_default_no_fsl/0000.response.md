Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all potential cases as described, including when the value is less than all elements in the list or when the value is greater than all elements. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
