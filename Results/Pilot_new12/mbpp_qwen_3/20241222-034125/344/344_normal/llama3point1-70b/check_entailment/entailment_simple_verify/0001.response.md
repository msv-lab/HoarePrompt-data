Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Based on the annotated version, we can see that the function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value. This logic covers all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
