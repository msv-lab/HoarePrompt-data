Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotations further clarify that the function returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, and if no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function handles all potential cases as described and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given logic. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
