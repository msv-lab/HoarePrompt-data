Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float.
   
2. **Loop Execution**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of `sorted_list`. During each iteration, it checks if the current element (`sorted_list[i]`) is greater than or equal to the `value`. If this condition is met, the function immediately returns the index `i`.

3. **No Matching Element**: If the loop completes without finding an element that meets the condition (`sorted_list[i] >= value`), the function returns the length of `sorted_list`.

4. **Correctness**: 
   - When `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns the length of `sorted_list`, which indicates the position where `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - When `value` matches or is greater than one of the elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns the index of the first such element, which is the right insertion point for `value`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
