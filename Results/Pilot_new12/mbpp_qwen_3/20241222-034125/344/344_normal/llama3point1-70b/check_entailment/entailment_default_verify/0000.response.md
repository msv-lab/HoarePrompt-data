Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, and if no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. The provided code handles all cases as described in the problem description and the output hints, making the original assessment accurate. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given logic and the provided constraints.
