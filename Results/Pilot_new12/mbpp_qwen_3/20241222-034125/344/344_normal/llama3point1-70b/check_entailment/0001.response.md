Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value. This logic covers all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios.
