Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. According to the output hints, the function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. The provided code iterates through the list and checks each element against the specified value, returning the appropriate index when the condition is met or the length of the list if the value is greater than all elements. The logic handles all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios, as evidenced by the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
