Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct index to insert the value to maintain the sorted order. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as described, and there are no potential cases where the function would fail to meet the problem description under the given assumptions about valid input.
