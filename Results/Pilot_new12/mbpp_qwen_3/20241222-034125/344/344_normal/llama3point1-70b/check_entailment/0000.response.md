Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If so, it returns the index of that element. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, indicating the position where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It works correctly for both cases where the value is already present in the list and where it needs to be inserted at various positions. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given logic.
