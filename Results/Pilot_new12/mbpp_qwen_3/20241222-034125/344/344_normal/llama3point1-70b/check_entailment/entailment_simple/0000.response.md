Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float.

2. **Loop Logic**: The function iterates through each element of `sorted_list` using a `for` loop. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`. If such an element is found, the function immediately returns the index of that element, indicating the right insertion point.

3. **Post-Loop Logic**: If no element in the list is greater than or equal to `value` (i.e., the loop completes without finding a suitable element), the function returns the length of the list. This is because, in this case, `value` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.

4. **Output**: The function always returns an integer, either the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value` or the length of the list.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the requirement to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
