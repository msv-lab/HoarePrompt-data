#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, and `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value` if the loop executes, otherwise `i` is 0.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` (a list of integers or floats) and a value `value` (an integer or float). It returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list `sorted_list`.
