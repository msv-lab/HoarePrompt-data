Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the provided output hints, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions and the detailed explanation of how the function behaves in various scenarios, including edge cases such as an empty list and the presence of duplicate values, confirm its correctness. The output hints further validate this understanding, ensuring that the function adheres to the expected behavior for both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains accurate.
