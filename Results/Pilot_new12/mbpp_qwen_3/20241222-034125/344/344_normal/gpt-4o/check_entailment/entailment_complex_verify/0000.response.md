Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function correctly handles the following scenarios:
- If `sorted_list` is empty, `bisect_right` will return 0, indicating the correct insertion point.
- If `value` is already present in `sorted_list`, `bisect_right` will return the index of the first occurrence of `value` plus one, ensuring the correct position for maintaining the sorted order.
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
