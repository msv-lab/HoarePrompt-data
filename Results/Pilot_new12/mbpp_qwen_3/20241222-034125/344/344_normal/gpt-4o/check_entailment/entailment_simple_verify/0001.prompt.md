You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to meet the problem description for the given test cases. 

- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the output `4` is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the output `2` is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the output `4` is correct because `7` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.

Since the function works correctly for the given assertions and the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is well-documented, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases within the scope of the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in 'sorted_list' where 'value' should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
