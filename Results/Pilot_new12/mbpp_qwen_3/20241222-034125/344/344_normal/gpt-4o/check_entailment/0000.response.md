Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which matches the requirement of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function handles the basic cases correctly and uses a built-in function designed for this purpose, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work for all potential cases that would be encountered with a properly sorted list.
