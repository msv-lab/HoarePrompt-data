Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to meet the problem description for the given test cases. 

- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the output `4` is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the output `2` is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the output `4` is correct because `7` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.

Since the function works correctly for the given assertions and the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is well-documented, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases within the scope of the provided problem description.
