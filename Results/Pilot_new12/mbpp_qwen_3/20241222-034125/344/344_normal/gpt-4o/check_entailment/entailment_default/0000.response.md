Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` correctly returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given assertions. There are no potential edge cases mentioned that the code fails to handle, and the examples provided demonstrate the correct behavior for different scenarios, including the presence of the value in the list and the case of an empty list. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
