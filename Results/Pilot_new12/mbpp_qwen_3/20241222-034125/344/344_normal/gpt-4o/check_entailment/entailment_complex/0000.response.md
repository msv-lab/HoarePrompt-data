Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program implements a function `func_1` that correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value `value` and returns the index where `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. This functionality aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the insertion point for a value in a sorted list such that the value at the returned index is greater than the value being inserted. This ensures that the returned index `i` satisfies the condition that all elements in `sorted_list[:i]` are less than or equal to `value`, and all elements in `sorted_list[i:]` are greater than `value`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: The `bisect_right` method handles an empty list by returning 0, which is the correct index to insert the value at the beginning.
   - **Value Already Present**: The `bisect_right` method correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the value plus one, ensuring the value is inserted after the last occurrence to maintain the sorted order.
   - **Positive and Negative Numbers**: The `bisect_right` method works correctly with both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers, due to its design.

3. **Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input list is already sorted and that the inputs are valid integers or floats. Given these assumptions, the program correctly implements the required functionality without needing additional error handling for invalid inputs.

Since the function `func_1` precisely meets the problem description and handles all relevant edge cases, the program is correct.
