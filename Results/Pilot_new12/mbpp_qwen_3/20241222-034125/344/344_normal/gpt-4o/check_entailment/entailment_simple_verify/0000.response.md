Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The `func_1` function uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is specifically designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function signature and the provided assertions confirm that the function is implemented correctly to meet the problem description. The annotated version of the code further supports this by clearly stating that `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is an integer or float. The function returns the correct index where the value should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order, as demonstrated by the assertions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
