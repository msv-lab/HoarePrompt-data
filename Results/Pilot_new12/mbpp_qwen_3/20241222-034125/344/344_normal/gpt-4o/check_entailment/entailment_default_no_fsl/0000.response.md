Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` using the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. This method returns the correct insertion point for the specified value in a sorted list. The examples and the output hints confirm that the function works as expected for the given cases. The code handles the edge cases where the list is empty or the value is already present in the list. Additionally, it correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers. Since the problem description and the examples provided in the output hints match the behavior of the implemented function, the code is correct for every potential case.
