Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program before and after the function call, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
