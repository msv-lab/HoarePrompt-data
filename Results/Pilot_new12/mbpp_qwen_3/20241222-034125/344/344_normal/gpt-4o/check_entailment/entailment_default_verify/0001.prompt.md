You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to meet the problem description for the given test cases. 

- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the output `4` is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the output `2` is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2` to maintain the sorted order.
- For the input `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the output `4` is correct because `7` should be inserted at index `4` to maintain the sorted order.

Since the function works correctly for the given assertions and the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is well-documented, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases within the scope of the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list` (a list of integers or floats sorted in non-decreasing order) and a parameter `value` (an integer or float). It returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. The function uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the correct insertion point. This method ensures that the returned index `i` satisfies the condition that all elements in `sorted_list[:i]` are less than or equal to `value`, and all elements in `sorted_list[i:]` are greater than `value`.

Potential edge cases and additional considerations:
- If `sorted_list` is empty, `bisect_right` will return 0, indicating that `value` should be inserted at the beginning of the list.
- If `value` is already present in `sorted_list`, `bisect_right` will return the index of the first occurrence of `value` plus one, which is the correct position to insert `value` to maintain the sorted order.
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
