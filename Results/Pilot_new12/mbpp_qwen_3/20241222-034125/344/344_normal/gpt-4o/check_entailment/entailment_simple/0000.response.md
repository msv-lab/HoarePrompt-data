Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float. This matches the problem description of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order.

2. **Use of `bisect.bisect_right`**: The function uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which is a part of the `bisect` module in Python. This function returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain the list's sorted order. It finds the first position where `value` can be inserted without violating the order.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test different scenarios:
   - When the value `6` is greater than all elements in the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, `bisect.bisect_right` correctly returns `4`.
   - When the value `3` should be inserted between `2` and `4`, `bisect.bisect_right` correctly returns `2`.
   - When the value `7` is greater than all elements in the list, `bisect.bisect_right` correctly returns `4`.

Since the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, and the provided assertions validate its behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
