#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in 'sorted_list' where 'value' should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list` (a list of integers or floats sorted in non-decreasing order) and a parameter `value` (an integer or float). It returns the index in `sorted_list` where `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. The function uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the correct insertion point. This method ensures that the returned index `i` satisfies the condition that all elements in `sorted_list[:i]` are less than or equal to `value`, and all elements in `sorted_list[i:]` are greater than `value`.

Potential edge cases and additional considerations:
- If `sorted_list` is empty, `bisect_right` will return 0, indicating that `value` should be inserted at the beginning of the list.
- If `value` is already present in `sorted_list`, `bisect_right` will return the index of the first occurrence of `value` plus one, which is the correct position to insert `value` to maintain the sorted order.
- The function correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as floating-point numbers.
