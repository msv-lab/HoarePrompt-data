Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality Match**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `string` and `substring`, both of which are expected to be strings. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` using the `find` method.

2. **Return Value Handling**:
   - If `substring` is not found in `string` (`start == -1`), the function correctly returns `None`.
   - If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple containing:
     - The substring itself (`substring`).
     - The starting index of the first occurrence (`start`).
     - The ending index just before the last character of the `substring` (`end - 1`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `substring` is not found by returning `None`.
   - When `substring` is found, the function correctly calculates the end index (`end`) and returns the required tuple.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The function precisely meets the requirements outlined in the problem description without any omissions or misinterpretations.

Given the assumptions about valid inputs, the program is designed to handle all specified cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
