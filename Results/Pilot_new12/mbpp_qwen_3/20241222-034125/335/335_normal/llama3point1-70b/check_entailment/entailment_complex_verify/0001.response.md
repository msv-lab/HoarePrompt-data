Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. If the substring is not found, it should return `None`. The function should return a tuple containing the substring and its start and end positions if found.

2. **Function Behavior**: 
   - The function uses `string.find(substring)` to locate the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
   - If `substring` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
   - If `substring` is found, the function calculates the end index as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns a tuple containing `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`.

3. **Annotations**: The annotations provided in the annotated version align with the functionâ€™s behavior. They correctly describe the state of the program at various points and confirm that the function handles both the case where `substring` is found and where it is not found.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where `substring` is not found in `string` by returning `None`. For the case where `substring` is found, the function returns the required tuple, which includes the substring and the start and end positions.

Given these points, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the annotations support its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being `True` is accurate.
