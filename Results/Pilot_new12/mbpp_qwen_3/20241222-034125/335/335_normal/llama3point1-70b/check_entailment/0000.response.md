Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring, and then calculates the ending index. This approach handles all potential cases where the substring might or might not be present in the string. Since there are no edge cases or scenarios identified where this function would fail, the program is considered correct.
