Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` using the `find` method and returns the required tuple if found, or `None` if not found. The code handles all potential cases as described:

1. If `substring` is not found in `string`, it returns `None`.
2. If `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence, and the index just before the last character of `substring`.

There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function accurately performs the described operations for every potential case.
