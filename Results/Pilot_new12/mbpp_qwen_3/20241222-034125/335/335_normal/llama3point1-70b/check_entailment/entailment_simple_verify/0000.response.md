Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function correctly handles both the presence and absence of the substring within the given string. When the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, its starting index, and the index just before its last character. When the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to find the occurrence and position of the substring and return `None` if there is no match. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
