Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found and a tuple containing the substring, its start index, and the end index (just before the last character) if the substring is found. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for both cases: when the substring is found and when it is not found. There are no apparent issues or missing functionalities that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description and the provided code.
