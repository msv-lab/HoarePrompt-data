Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding the Substring**: 
   - The function uses `string.find(substring)` to find the starting index (`start`) of the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, `find()` returns `-1`.

2. **Returning `None` if No Match**:
   - If `start == -1`, indicating that `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement to return `None` if there is no match.

3. **Calculating End Index**:
   - After confirming that `substring` is found (i.e., `start != -1`), the function calculates the ending index (`end`) as `start + len(substring) - 1`. This ensures that `end` points to the index just before the last character of `substring`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns a tuple containing `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`, which provides the substring itself along with its starting and ending positions.

Given these steps, the program consistently meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
