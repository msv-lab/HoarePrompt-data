Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, and if found, it returns a tuple containing the substring itself along with the start and end positions. 

- If the substring is found, the function returns the substring and its positions as indicated by the annotated code.
- If the substring is not found, the function returns `None` as per the annotated code.

The annotations clearly describe the states of the program at different points and align with the expected behavior as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being `True` is maintained.
