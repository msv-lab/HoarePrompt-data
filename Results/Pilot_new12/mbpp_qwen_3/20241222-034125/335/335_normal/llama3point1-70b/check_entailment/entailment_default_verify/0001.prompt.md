You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, and if found, it returns a tuple containing the substring itself along with the start and end positions. The function handles all potential cases as per the problem description:

- If the substring is found, it returns the substring and its positions.
- If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all cases, the correctness is `True`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are strings. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: the non-empty string `substring`, the index `start` of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and the index `end - 1` which is the position just before the last character of `substring` in `string`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` using the `find` method.
2. If `substring` is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None`.
3. If `substring` is found, the function calculates the end index as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns a tuple containing `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `substring` is not found in `string` by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where `substring` is found in `string` and returns the required tuple.

There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function accurately performs the described operations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
