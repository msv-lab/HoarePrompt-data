Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function correctly returns `None` if the substring is not found in the string, and it returns the expected tuple with the substring, its starting index, and the position just before the last character of the substring when the substring is found. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as intended for both cases: when the substring is found and when it is not. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and no changes are needed.
