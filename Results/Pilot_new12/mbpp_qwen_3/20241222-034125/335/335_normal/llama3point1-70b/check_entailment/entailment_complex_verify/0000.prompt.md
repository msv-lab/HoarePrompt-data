You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring, and then calculates the ending index. This approach handles all potential cases where the substring might or might not be present in the string. Since there are no edge cases or scenarios identified where this function would fail, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is not equal to -1
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #`substring`, the non-empty string found in `string`; `start`, the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`; `end - 1`, which is the index right before the last character of `substring` in `string`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are strings. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: the non-empty string `substring`, the index `start` of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and the index `end - 1` which is the position just before the last character of `substring` in `string`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` using the `find` method.
2. If `substring` is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None`.
3. If `substring` is found, the function calculates the end index as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns a tuple containing `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `substring` is not found in `string` by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where `substring` is found in `string` and returns the required tuple.

There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function accurately performs the described operations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
