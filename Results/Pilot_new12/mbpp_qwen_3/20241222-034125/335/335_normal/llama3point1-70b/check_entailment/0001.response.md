Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, and if found, it returns a tuple containing the substring itself along with the start and end positions. The function handles all potential cases as per the problem description:

- If the substring is found, it returns the substring and its positions.
- If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all cases, the correctness is `True`.
