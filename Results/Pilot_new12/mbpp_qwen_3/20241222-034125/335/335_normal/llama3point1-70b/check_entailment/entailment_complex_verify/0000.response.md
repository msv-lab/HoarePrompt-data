Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, and returns a tuple with the substring, its starting index, and the index just before the last character of the substring if it is found. The annotated version confirms that the function handles both cases (substring found or not found) correctly and provides the expected outputs. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities identified that would invalidate the original assessment.
