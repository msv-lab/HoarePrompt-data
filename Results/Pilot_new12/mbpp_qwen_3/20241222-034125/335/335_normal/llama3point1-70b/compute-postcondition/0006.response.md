The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. `string` is a string, and `substring` is a non-empty string. 

If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `substring`, the non-empty string found in `string`; `start`, the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`; and `end - 1`, which is the index right before the last character of `substring` in `string`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `string` and a non-empty string `substring`, and either return `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, or return a tuple containing the found substring, its starting index, and the index just before its ending index.
