The `find` method searches for the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and returns the index where it starts, or `-1` if it is not found. Since `string` and `substring` are given as non-empty strings, `start` will be assigned the starting index of `substring` within `string` or `-1` if `substring` is not found. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`string` is a string and `substring` is a non-empty string; `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1 if not found**
