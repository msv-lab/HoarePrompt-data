Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are strings. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: the non-empty string `substring`, the index `start` of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and the index `end - 1` which is the position just before the last character of `substring` in `string`.

The function performs the following actions:
1. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` using the `find` method.
2. If `substring` is not found (`start == -1`), the function returns `None`.
3. If `substring` is found, the function calculates the end index as `start + len(substring) - 1` and returns a tuple containing `substring`, `start`, and `end - 1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `substring` is not found in `string` by returning `None`.
- The function also correctly handles the case where `substring` is found in `string` and returns the required tuple.

There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function accurately performs the described operations.**
