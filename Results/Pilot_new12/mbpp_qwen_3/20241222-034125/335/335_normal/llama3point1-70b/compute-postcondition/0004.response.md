The code assigns the value of `start + len(substring)` to `end`. Given that `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and `start` is not equal to -1, the length of `substring` (denoted by `len(substring)`) is added to `start` to determine the end index. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `start` is not equal to -1; `end` is `start + len(substring)`.
Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `start` is not equal to -1; `end` is `start + len(substring)`**
