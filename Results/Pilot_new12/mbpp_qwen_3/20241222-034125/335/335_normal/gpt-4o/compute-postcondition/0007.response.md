Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`, both of which are strings. The function searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`.

- If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`.
- If `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `sub_string` itself, the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and `end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, where `start_pos` is the index of the first character of `sub_string`.

This function effectively locates the specified substring within a larger string and provides information about its position and length if found, or indicates absence of the substring by returning `None` if not found.**

Note: The annotation in the provided code mentions `Case_1` and `Case_2`, but the code does not return `main_string` or `end_pos` separately; instead, it returns them together in a tuple when the substring is found.
