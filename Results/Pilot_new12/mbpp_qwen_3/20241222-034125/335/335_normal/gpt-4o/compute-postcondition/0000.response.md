The `find` method is called on `main_string` to search for the first occurrence of `sub_string`. The result of this method is stored in `start_pos`. The method returns the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, or `-1` if `sub_string` is not found. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` or -1 if `sub_string` is not found.**
