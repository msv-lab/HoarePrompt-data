Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times within the main string correctly. Specifically, it only returns the first occurrence of the substring along with its start and end positions. According to the problem description, we need to find the occurrence and position of all substrings within the string, not just the first one. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == [('python', 0, 6), ('python', 14, 20)]
```

The function currently returns only the first occurrence of 'python' as shown in the original assertions. It should return both occurrences to be fully correct.
