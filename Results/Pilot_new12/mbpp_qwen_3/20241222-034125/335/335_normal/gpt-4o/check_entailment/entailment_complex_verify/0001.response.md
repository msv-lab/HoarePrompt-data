Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function needs to find all occurrences of the substring within the main string and return them along with their positions. However, the provided function `func_1` only finds and returns the first occurrence of the substring. The annotated version confirms that the function only handles the first occurrence and returns `None` if the substring is not found once. Since the function does not account for multiple occurrences of the substring, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
