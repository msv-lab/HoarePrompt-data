Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and returns `None` if the substring is not present. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling both the presence and absence of the substring appropriately. All provided test cases are satisfied, and there are no indications of incorrect behavior or edge cases that would contradict the original assessment.
