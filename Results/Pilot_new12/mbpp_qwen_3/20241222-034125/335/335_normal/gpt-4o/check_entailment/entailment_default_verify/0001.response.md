Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the output hints, the function `func_1` is intended to find the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. However, the original assessment is accurate because the function currently only returns the first occurrence of the substring and does not handle multiple occurrences. The output hints confirm that the function only returns the start and end positions for the first match, which does not align with the problem description requiring the function to return all occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
