Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. The annotations support this by showing that the function returns the expected results for all provided test cases. Specifically, it returns the substring along with its start and end positions when the substring is found, and returns `None` when the substring is not found. The function handles all the assertions correctly, and there are no issues with the logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the provided inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
