Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It aims to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string and returns `None` if there is no match. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, both of which are strings as per the problem description.

2. **Finding Substring Position**:
   - The function uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. The `find` method returns `-1` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the requirement to return `None` if there is no match.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If the substring is found (`start_pos != -1`), the function calculates the ending position (`end_pos`) as `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns the substring along with its start and end positions.
   - If the substring is not found (`start_pos == -1`), the function correctly returns `None`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
     - When the substring is present at the beginning of the main string (`'python', 0, 6`).
     - When the substring is present in the middle of the main string (`'programming', 7, 18`).
     - When the substring is present at the end of the main string (`'language', 31, 39`).
     - When the substring is not present in the main string (`None`).

Given that the function accurately implements the required behavior and all test cases pass, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
