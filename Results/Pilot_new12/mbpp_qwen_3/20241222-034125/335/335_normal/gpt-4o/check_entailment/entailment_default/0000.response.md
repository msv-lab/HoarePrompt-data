Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions if found, or `None` if the substring is not present in the main string. The examples provided confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` returns `('python', 0, 6)` which is correct.
2. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')` returns `('programming', 7, 18)` which is correct.
3. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language')` returns `('language', 31, 39)` which is correct.
4. `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` returns `None` which is correct.

The function uses the `find` method to locate the substring and calculates the end position accurately. There are no cases provided in the problem description or the examples that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case described.
