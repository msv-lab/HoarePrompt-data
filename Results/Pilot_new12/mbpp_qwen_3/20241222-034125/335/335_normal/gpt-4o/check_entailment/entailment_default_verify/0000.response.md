Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function accurately finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns the appropriate information or `None` if the substring is not found. The provided output hints further confirm this, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the substring and its positions or `None` if not found. Since the function handles all the provided assertions correctly and the output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
