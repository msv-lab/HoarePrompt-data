Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the first occurrence of a substring (`sub_string`) within a larger string (`main_string`). It returns a tuple containing the substring itself, the starting index of the substring, and the ending index of the substring, or `None` if the substring is not found.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Sub-string Found**: When the substring is found, the function calculates the starting position (`start_pos`) using `main_string.find(sub_string)`, and then computes the ending position (`end_pos`) as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`. It then returns a tuple with the substring, the starting position, and the ending position.
   - **Sub-string Not Found**: If the substring is not found, the `find` method returns `-1`, and the function immediately returns `None`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided cover various scenarios:
     - Case 1: The substring is found at the beginning of the string.
     - Case 2: The substring is found in the middle of the string.
     - Case 3: The substring is found at the end of the string.
     - Case 4: The substring is not found in the string.

4. **Input Validation**: The problem statement assumes that the inputs are valid (strings). The function does not perform any additional validation on the types of the inputs beyond checking their lengths, ensuring that it adheres to the provided assumptions.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the required behavior as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
