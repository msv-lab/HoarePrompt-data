You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the main string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions, and returns `None` if the substring is not found. The function handles all the given test cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`, both of which are strings. The function searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`.

- If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`.
- If `sub_string` is found in `main_string`, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `sub_string` itself, the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and `end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, where `start_pos` is the index of the first character of `sub_string`.

This function effectively locates the specified substring within a larger string and provides information about its position and length if found, or indicates absence of the substring by returning `None` if not found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
