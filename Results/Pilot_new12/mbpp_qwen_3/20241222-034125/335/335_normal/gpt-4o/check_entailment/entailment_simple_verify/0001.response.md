Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is expected to find all occurrences of the substring within the main string and return their positions. However, the provided function only returns the first occurrence along with its start and end positions. This does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function only handles the first occurrence and does not account for subsequent matches, which is a critical flaw according to the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be modified to find and return all occurrences of the substring.
