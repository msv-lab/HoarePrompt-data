The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements within the list. If a duplicate is found during the iteration, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, the function returns `False`. There are no additional side effects or changes to the input list `arr`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` and only returns a boolean value indicating whether duplicates were found.
