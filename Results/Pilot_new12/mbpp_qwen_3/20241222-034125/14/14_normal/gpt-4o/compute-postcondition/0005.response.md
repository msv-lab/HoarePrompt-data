`num` is added to the set `seen`. Since `num` was not in `seen` initially, adding it does not change the fact that `num` is not in `seen`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged, and `seen` now contains `num`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `num` is in `seen`**
