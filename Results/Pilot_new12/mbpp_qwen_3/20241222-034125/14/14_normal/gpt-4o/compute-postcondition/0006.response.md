According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `num` is in `seen`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following needs to be true:
1. `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
2. `seen` is a set containing the next element from `arr`.
3. `num` is the next element from `arr`.
4. `num` is in `seen`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since `num` was the first element in the list `arr` in the previous iteration, it has now moved to the next element in the list.
2. `seen` still contains the previous `num`, as it hasn't changed yet.
3. `num` is now the second element in `arr`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `arr` remains a non-empty list of integers (since it started as such and only shifted one element).
- `seen` still contains the first element of the original `arr` (which is now `num` in the next iteration).
- `num` is the second element in `arr`.
- `num` is in `seen`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `num` is in `seen`**
