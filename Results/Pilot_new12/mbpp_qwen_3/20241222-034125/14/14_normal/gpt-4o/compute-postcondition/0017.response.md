Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements within the list. If a duplicate is found during the iteration, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, the function returns `False`. There are no additional side effects or changes to the input list `arr`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` and only returns a boolean value indicating whether duplicates were found.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where duplicates are found during the iteration and returns `True`.
- The function correctly returns `False` if no duplicates are found.
- However, the function does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. In this case, the function would return `False` without checking any elements, which is correct behavior.

In summary, the function checks for duplicates in a list of integers and returns `True` if any duplicates are found, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list and correctly handles both duplicate and non-duplicate cases.
