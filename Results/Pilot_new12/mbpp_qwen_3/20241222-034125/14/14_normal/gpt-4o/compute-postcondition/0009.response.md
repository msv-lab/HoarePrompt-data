The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is the second element of `arr`, it is known that `num` is already part of `seen` based on the initial state. Adding a value to a set that already contains that value does not change the set. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing the first element of `arr` and `num`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and the function returns None.**
