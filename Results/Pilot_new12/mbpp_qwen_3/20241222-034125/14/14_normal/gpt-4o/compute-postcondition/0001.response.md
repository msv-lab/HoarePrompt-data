State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first element of `arr`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least one element.
3. The initial state mentions that `seen` is an empty set. This remains unchanged as the loop hasn't started executing yet.
4. The loop variable `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `arr` must be a non-empty list of integers.
- `num` should be set to the first element of `arr`.

This ensures the loop can execute at least once.
