`seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is the third element of `arr` and was previously added to `seen`, adding `num` again does not change the set `seen`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing the first element of `arr` and `num`, and `num` is the third element of `arr`.**
