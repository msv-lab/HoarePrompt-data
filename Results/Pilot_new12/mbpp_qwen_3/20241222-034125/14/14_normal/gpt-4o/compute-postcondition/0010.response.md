Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `seen` is a set containing the first element of `arr`.
   - `num` is the second element of `arr`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for num in arr:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - In the previous iteration, `num` was set to the second element of `arr`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the third element of `arr`.
   - Since `seen` already contains the first element (which was `num` in the previous iteration), we do not need to update the `seen` set.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least a third element in `arr`.

5. **New State:**
   - `arr` is still a non-empty list of integers.
   - `seen` is still a set containing the first element of `arr`.
   - `num` is now the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `seen` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, and the function returns None.**
