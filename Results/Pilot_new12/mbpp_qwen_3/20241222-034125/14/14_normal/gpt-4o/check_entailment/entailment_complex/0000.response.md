Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks for the presence of any duplicate elements in the input list of integers and returns `True` if at least one duplicate is found, and `False` otherwise. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The program assumes valid input (a list of integers) as specified in the problem description and does not handle invalid inputs, which is acceptable under the given assumptions.

2. **Algorithm**: 
   - A set named `seen` is initialized to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.
   - The program iterates over each element in the input list `arr`.
   - For each element, it checks if the element is already in the `seen` set.
     - If the element is found in `seen`, it means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns `True`.
     - If the element is not found in `seen`, it adds the element to the `seen` set.
   - After the loop completes, if no duplicates are found, the function returns `False`.

3. **Output**: The function correctly returns `True` for cases where there are duplicates and `False` when there are no duplicates, matching the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the required functionality, and hence it is correct.
