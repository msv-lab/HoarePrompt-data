Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to check for the presence of duplicate elements in an array of integers. The provided test cases validate the function's ability to accurately identify duplicates in various scenarios. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function uses a set to track seen elements and returns `True` if a duplicate is found, otherwise it returns `False`. The state descriptions match the expected behavior of the function, and there are no contradictions or issues identified in the annotated version. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
