Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. It uses a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. If an element is encountered that is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The program logic correctly identifies duplicates and returns the appropriate boolean value. The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False` - No duplicates, returns `False`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True` - Duplicate '4' found, returns `True`.
3. `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True` - Multiple duplicates found, returns `True`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
