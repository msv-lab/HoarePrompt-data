Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. It uses a set to keep track of seen numbers and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. The examples provided cover different scenarios:
- An array with no duplicates: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- An array with a duplicate: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`
- An array with multiple duplicates: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`

The function works as expected in these cases and handles the problem description accurately. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the provided examples and reasoning.
