Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function uses a set to efficiently check for duplicates in the given array of integers. The provided output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list, checks for duplicates using a set, and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found, or `False` if no duplicates are present. The function does not modify the input list and only returns a boolean value, which aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the provided problem description and output hints.
