Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of seen elements. For each element in the array, it checks if the element is already in the set. If it is, it returns `True`, indicating a duplicate was found. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. This approach correctly identifies the presence of duplicates for any given array of integers. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness for the given scenarios.
