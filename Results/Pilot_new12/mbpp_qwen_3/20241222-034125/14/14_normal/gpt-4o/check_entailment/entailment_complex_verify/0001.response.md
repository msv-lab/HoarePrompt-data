Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements. It uses a set to track seen numbers and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with one duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates. The function behaves as expected in all cases, and the annotations support the correctness of the function without any contradictions or issues. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
