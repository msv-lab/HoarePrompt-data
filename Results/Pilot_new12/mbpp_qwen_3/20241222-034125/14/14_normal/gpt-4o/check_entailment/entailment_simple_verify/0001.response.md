Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`arr`), which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Set Initialization**: A set named `seen` is initialized to keep track of the unique elements encountered in the array.
3. **For Loop Execution**: For each number in the array, the function checks if the number is already in the set `seen`. If it is, the function immediately returns `True` indicating a duplicate was found.
4. **Addition to Set**: If the number is not in the set, it is added to `seen`.
5. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, if no duplicates were found, the function returns `False`.

The annotated version clearly shows that the function correctly processes the array and maintains the state as described. It handles various cases, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with one or more duplicates, and arrays with multiple duplicates. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
