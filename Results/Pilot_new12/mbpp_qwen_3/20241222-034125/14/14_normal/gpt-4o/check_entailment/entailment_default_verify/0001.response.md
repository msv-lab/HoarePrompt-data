Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check for duplicate elements in an array of integers. The provided assertions cover different scenarios (arrays with no duplicates, arrays with a single duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates), and the function behaves as expected in all cases. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list, uses a set to track seen elements, and returns `True` at the first sign of a duplicate. Since the program meets the problem description and the provided examples and explanations support its correctness, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
