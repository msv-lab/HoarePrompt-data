You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique elements of `arr`, the function returns either `True` if any duplicate is found or `None` if no duplicates are found.
    return False
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements within the list. If a duplicate is found during the iteration, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, the function returns `False`. There are no additional side effects or changes to the input list `arr`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` and only returns a boolean value indicating whether duplicates were found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
