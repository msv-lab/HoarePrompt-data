Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that checks for the presence of any duplicate elements in an array of integers. The code uses a set to keep track of seen elements and iterates through the array, returning `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. If no duplicates are found, it returns `False`. The code handles all the provided test cases correctly:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which has no duplicates, the function correctly returns `False`.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, which contains a duplicate (the number 4), the function correctly returns `True`.
3. For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, which contains multiple duplicates, the function correctly returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to be correct and works for all potential cases where duplicates may exist in the array.
