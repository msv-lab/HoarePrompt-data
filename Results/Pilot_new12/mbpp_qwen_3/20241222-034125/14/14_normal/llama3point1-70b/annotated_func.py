#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if the length of list `arr` is not equal to the length of the set of `arr`, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if the list contains duplicate elements, otherwise it returns `False`. The function achieves this by comparing the length of the original list `arr` with the length of a set created from `arr`. If the lengths differ, it indicates that there are duplicate elements in the list, hence the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles an empty list correctly by returning `False` since an empty list and its corresponding set both have a length of 0. There are no apparent missing functionalities in the given code.
