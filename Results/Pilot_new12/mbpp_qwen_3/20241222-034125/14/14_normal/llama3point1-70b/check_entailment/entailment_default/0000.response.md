Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks for duplicates in an array by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths differ, it indicates that there are duplicate elements in the array, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach is correct and works for all potential cases, including an empty list, as both an empty list and its corresponding set have a length of 0. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and there are no apparent missing functionalities.
