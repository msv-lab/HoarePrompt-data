Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a list contains duplicate elements by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates. The function handles an empty list correctly by returning `False`, as both the original list and its corresponding set would have a length of 0. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program as per the problem description.
