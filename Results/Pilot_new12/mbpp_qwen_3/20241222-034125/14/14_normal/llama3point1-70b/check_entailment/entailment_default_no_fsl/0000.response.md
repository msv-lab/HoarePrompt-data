Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from it. If there are duplicates, the length of the set will be less than the length of the original array. The function handles an empty list correctly by returning `False`, as both the original list and the set created from it would have a length of 0. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the problem description and the output hints.
