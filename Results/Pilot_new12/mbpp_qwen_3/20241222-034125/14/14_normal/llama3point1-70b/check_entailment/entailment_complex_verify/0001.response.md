Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version and the problem description, the function `func_1` indeed checks for the presence of duplicate elements in the array by comparing the length of the array with the length of the set of the array. However, the original assessment is accurate because the function currently returns `True` if there is at least one duplicate element, which is the opposite of what the problem description asks for. The problem description requires the function to return `True` if there are any duplicates, but the current implementation returns `True` when duplicates are found and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the function needs to be corrected to return `True` only when duplicates are present. The annotated version confirms that the current implementation does not meet the problem description as stated.
