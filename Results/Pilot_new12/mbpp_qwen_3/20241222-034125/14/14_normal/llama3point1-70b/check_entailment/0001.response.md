Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the length of the array is different from the length of the set of the array. This approach works correctly for finding duplicates, but it has a logical issue. The function returns `True` if there is at least one duplicate element, which is correct. However, the problem description asks to find whether the array contains any duplicate element, not just to check for the presence of duplicates. The function does not explicitly state that it returns `True` only if there is a duplicate, and it could be misleading. A more precise way to implement this would be to return a boolean indicating the presence of a duplicate directly, like so:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) > len(set(arr))
```

This version clearly indicates that it returns `True` if there is at least one duplicate element in the array. Since the original implementation does not provide this clarity, it is better to rephrase it as `False` until it is made explicit.
