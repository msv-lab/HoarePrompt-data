Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function returns `True` if the length of the list `arr` is not equal to the length of the set of `arr`. While this logic correctly identifies the presence of at least one duplicate element (since removing duplicates would result in a smaller set), the problem description asks for a function that determines whether the array contains any duplicate element. The provided function returns `True` even if there are no duplicates, which is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function should return `True` only if there is at least one duplicate element, which is not the case with the current implementation.
