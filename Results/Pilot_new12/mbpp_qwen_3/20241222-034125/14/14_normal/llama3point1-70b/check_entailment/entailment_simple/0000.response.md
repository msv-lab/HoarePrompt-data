Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement of finding whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that determines if there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers.
2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(arr)` takes a list `arr` as input.
   - It converts the list into a set (`set(arr)`), which inherently removes all duplicate elements.
   - It then compares the length of the original list (`len(arr)`) with the length of the set (`len(set(arr))`).
   - If the lengths are different, it means there were duplicates in the list, and the function returns `True`.
   - If the lengths are the same, it means there were no duplicates, and the function returns `False`.

This logic ensures that the function accurately identifies the presence of duplicates in the array. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
