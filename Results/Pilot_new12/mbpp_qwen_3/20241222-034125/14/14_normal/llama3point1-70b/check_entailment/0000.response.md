Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses a set to remove duplicates from the array and compares the lengths of the original array and the set. If the lengths are different, it indicates that there are duplicates in the array. This logic is correct for finding duplicates in an array of integers. The program works for all potential cases where duplicates might exist or not exist in the array. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
