Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check for duplicate elements in a given list of integers. The function compares the length of the original list `arr` with the length of a set created from `arr`. If the lengths differ, it means there are duplicate elements in the list, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This approach works because sets in Python inherently do not allow duplicate values, so the length of the set will be less than the length of the list if there are duplicates. This method handles all potential cases correctly, including an empty list, which would return `False` since both the original list and its corresponding set would have a length of 0.

Since the function accurately fulfills the requirement specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
