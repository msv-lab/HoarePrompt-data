Final: **False**

Reason: Although the program logic is correct in identifying the presence of duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set of the array, the original assessment is accurate because the function does not explicitly document or return `False` for the absence of duplicates in a clear manner. The function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are no duplicates, which aligns with the problem description but without explicit documentation, it can be misleading. Therefore, to maintain clarity and precision, the function should explicitly state its return value for the absence of duplicates, as suggested in the original assessment.
