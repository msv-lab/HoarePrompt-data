#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n', 'n' is 0
    return total
    #The program returns 0, as 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n', and 'n' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. After the loop has been executed, the function returns the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`. The annotations are misleading as they incorrectly state that the function returns 0. The actual functionality is as follows:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0.
2. It enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the last digit of `n` (using `n % 10`), adds it to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`) until `n` becomes 0.
3. Once the loop exits, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop, as `0 % 10` is 0 and `0 // 10` is still 0.
