`total` is incremented by `n % 10`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `n % 10` will be a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). However, without the specific value of `n`, we know that `total` will now be equal to the original `total` (which is 0) plus the last digit of `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0 + (last digit of `n`), `n` must be greater than 0**
