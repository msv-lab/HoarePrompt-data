According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `total` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, it could be either 0 or any positive integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
