`n` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator, which means the last digit of `n` is removed. The initial state of `total` is 0 plus the last digit of `n`. After executing the code, the value of `total` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `total`, and the value of `n` is updated to remove its last digit.

Output State: **`total` is 0 + (last digit of `n`), `n` is `n` without its last digit**
