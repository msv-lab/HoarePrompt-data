The code `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the last digit of `n` (which is `n % 10`) to `total`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `total` and `n`, we can denote them in a general form. The precondition is that for the loop to continue, \( n_{\text{current}} \) must be greater than 0.

After executing the line of code, the value of `total` is updated, but the exact value depends on the current value of `n`. The variable `n` itself is not specified in the initial state, but we know it must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`total` is `total` + `n % 10`, `n` > 0**
