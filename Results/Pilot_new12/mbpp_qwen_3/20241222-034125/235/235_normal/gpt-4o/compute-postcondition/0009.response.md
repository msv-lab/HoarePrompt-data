The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` is `n // 10` and `n` must be greater than 0, after executing the code, `n` will now hold the quotient of the previous value of `n` divided by 10.

Since the initial state also includes `total` being `total + 2 * (n % 10)`, this means `total` was previously updated based on the last digit of `n` before it was divided by 10. However, the code only modifies `n` itself, so `total` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is `total + 2 * (n % 10)`, `n` is `n // 10`**
