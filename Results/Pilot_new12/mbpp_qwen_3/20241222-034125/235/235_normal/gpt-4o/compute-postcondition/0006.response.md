`n` is divided by 10 using floor division (`//=`), which means the last digit of `n` is removed. The initial state is such that `total` is `total` + `n % 10`, indicating `total` is already updated with the last digit of `n`. After executing `n //= 10`, the last digit of `n` is no longer part of `n`.

Output State: **`total` is `total` + `n % 10`, `n` is `n // 10`**
