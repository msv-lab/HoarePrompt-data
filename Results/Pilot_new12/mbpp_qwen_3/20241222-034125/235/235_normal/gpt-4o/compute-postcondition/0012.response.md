The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns 0, as 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n', and 'n' is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`, given that `n` itself is 0.
