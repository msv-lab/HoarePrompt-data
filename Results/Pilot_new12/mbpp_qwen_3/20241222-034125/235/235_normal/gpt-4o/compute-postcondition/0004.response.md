Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `total` is 0 + (last digit of `n`)
  - `n` is `n` without its last digit

- **While Loop Statement:**
  ```
  while n > 0:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition of the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.
   - This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

2. **Current State of `n`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `n` has been updated to `n` without its last digit.
   - Letâ€™s denote the current value of `n` as \( n_{\text{current}} \).

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, \( n_{\text{current}} \) must be greater than 0.
   - If \( n_{\text{current}} \leq 0 \), the loop would terminate.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` such that it remains greater than 0.

### Updated Program State:
State: **`total` is 0 + (last digit of `n`), `n` must be greater than 0**
