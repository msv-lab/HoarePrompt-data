Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
2. **Loop Execution**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and add it to `total`. Then, it removes the last digit from `n` using `n //= 10` until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by returning 0 immediately, as `0 % 10` is 0 and `0 // 10` is 0, so no further operations are needed.
4. **Return Value**: Once the loop exits, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.

The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1(345)` should return `12` (3 + 4 + 5).
- `func_1(12)` should return `3` (1 + 2).
- `func_1(97)` should return `16` (9 + 7).

Thus, the program correctly meets the problem description for all valid inputs.
