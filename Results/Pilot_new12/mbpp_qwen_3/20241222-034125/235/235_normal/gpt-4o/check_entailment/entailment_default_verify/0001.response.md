Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints confirm this by explaining the step-by-step process of how the function works. The function handles various cases, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, as demonstrated by the test cases. The potential edge case of `n` being 0 is also handled correctly, returning 0 immediately without entering the loop. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
