Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version clearly shows that after the loop has been executed, the variable `total` holds the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`, and `n` is set to 0, indicating that all digits have been processed. The test cases provided in the assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is valid.
