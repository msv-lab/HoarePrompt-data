Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function works by iterating through each digit of the number, adding it to a cumulative total, and then reducing the number by removing the last digit until the number is reduced to 0. This approach ensures that all digits are accounted for, regardless of the size of the input number. The test cases provided cover various scenarios, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers, and the function passes these tests. Since the function works for the given test cases and the logic seems sound, it can be inferred that the function will work correctly for any non-negative integer input.
