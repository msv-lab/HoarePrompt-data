Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It handles the cases where the input is 0, a single-digit number, and multi-digit numbers. The function works correctly for the provided assertions and the potential edge case of `n` being 0. Since the problem description asks for the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer and the function meets this requirement for all tested cases, the program is correct.
