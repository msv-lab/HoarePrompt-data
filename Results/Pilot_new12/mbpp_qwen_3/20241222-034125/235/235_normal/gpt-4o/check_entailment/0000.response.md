Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The logic used in the `func_1` function iteratively extracts each digit from the number using the modulo operator and integer division, which ensures that all digits contribute to the total sum. The given test cases (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) and the implementation itself cover the required functionality without any issues. Since the program handles the examples correctly and the logic seems sound, it can be considered correct for the given problem description.
