Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. The code iterates through each digit of the number by continuously taking the remainder when divided by 10 (`n % 10`) and adding it to the total sum, then removing the last digit by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The code handles the edge case where `n` is 0 by returning 0 immediately without entering the loop.

The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1(345)` returns `12` (3 + 4 + 5 = 12)
- `func_1(12)` returns `3` (1 + 2 = 3)
- `func_1(97)` returns `16` (9 + 7 = 16)

Since the code correctly implements the required functionality for the given examples and handles the edge case of `n` being 0, the program is correct.
