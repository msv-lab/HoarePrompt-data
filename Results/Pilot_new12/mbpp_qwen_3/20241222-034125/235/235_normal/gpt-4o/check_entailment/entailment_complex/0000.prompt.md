You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n', 'n' is 0
    return total
    #The program returns 0, as 'total' is the sum of all digits of the original value of 'n', and 'n' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. After the loop has been executed, the function returns the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`. The annotations are misleading as they incorrectly state that the function returns 0. The actual functionality is as follows:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0.
2. It enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the last digit of `n` (using `n % 10`), adds it to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`) until `n` becomes 0.
3. Once the loop exits, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop, as `0 % 10` is 0 and `0 // 10` is still 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
