Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations, while potentially misleading due to their incorrect statement about the return value being 0, do not change the fact that the function behaves as intended. The logic within the function correctly iterates over each digit of the input number, adding them to `total`, and eventually returns the sum. The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
