You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The logic used in the `func_1` function iteratively extracts each digit from the number using the modulo operator and integer division, which ensures that all digits contribute to the total sum. The given test cases (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) and the implementation itself cover the required functionality without any issues. Since the program handles the examples correctly and the logic seems sound, it can be considered correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. After the loop has been executed, the function returns the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`. The annotations are misleading as they incorrectly state that the function returns 0. The actual functionality is as follows:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0.
2. It enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the last digit of `n` (using `n % 10`), adds it to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`) until `n` becomes 0.
3. Once the loop exits, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop, as `0 % 10` is 0 and `0 // 10` is still 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
