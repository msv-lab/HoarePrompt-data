Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is intended to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. This aligns with the problem description.
   
2. **Input Validation**: Although the problem description specifies that the input should be a non-negative integer, the solution does not explicitly validate the input type or value. However, as per the instructions, we assume the input will be valid, which means this omission does not affect the correctness under these assumptions.

3. **Algorithm**: 
   - The variable `total` is initialized to 0.
   - A `while` loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, `n % 10` extracts the last digit of `n`, which is added to `total`.
   - `n //= 10` removes the last digit from `n`.
   - Once `n` becomes 0, the loop ends, and `total` contains the sum of all digits of the original number.
   - The function returns `total`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(345)` returns `12` (3 + 4 + 5 = 12).
   - `func_1(12)` returns `3` (1 + 2 = 3).
   - `func_1(97)` returns `16` (9 + 7 = 16).

These test cases confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples.

Since the function meets the problem description and performs the required task accurately for the given examples, the correctness of the program is **True**.
