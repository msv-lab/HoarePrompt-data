Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version does mention that the function returns the sum of the digits, which aligns with the behavior observed in the function. Although the annotation about returning 0 was misleading, the actual implementation and the test cases provided confirm that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
