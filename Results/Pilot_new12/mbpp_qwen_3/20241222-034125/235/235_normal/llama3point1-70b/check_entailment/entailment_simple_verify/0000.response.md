Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This process correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer `n`. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program, and there are no logical flaws or missing edge cases identified in the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
