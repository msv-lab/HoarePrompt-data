Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as expected. Since the problem description asks for a function that gets the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, and the provided code satisfies this requirement without any logical errors or unsupported edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
