Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each digit, converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. The function also correctly returns 0 for the input 0, which is a valid edge case. Since the problem description only requires handling non-negative integers and the function correctly implements this, the code is correct for every potential case.
