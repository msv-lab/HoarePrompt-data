Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version clarifies that the function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits, and that there are no other edge cases present in the provided code. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as intended for all valid inputs of non-negative integers, and the annotations support this correctness.
