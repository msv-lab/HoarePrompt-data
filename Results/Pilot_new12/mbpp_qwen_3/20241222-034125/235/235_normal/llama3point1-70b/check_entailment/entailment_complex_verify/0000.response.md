Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iteration over each digit, conversion of each character back to an integer, and summation of these integers. The annotation also mentions that the function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. No other edge cases or logical flaws are present in the provided code, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description.
