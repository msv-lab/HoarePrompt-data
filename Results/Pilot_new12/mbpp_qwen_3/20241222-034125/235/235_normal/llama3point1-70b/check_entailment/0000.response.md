Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character, converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach works for all non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers. There doesn't appear to be any logical flaw or missing edge case that would make this program incorrect based on the given problem description.
