Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The output hints confirm that the function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iteration over each character, conversion back to an integer, and summation. The function also correctly returns 0 when the input is 0, which is an important edge case. Since the problem description asks for a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, and the provided code satisfies this requirement without any logical flaws or missing edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
