Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single argument `n`, which is a non-negative integer. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Conversion and Summation**: The function converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. It then iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer using `int(digit)`, and sums these integers using the `sum()` function. This approach ensures that all digits are correctly summed.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles the case where `n` is 0, correctly returning 0 as the sum of its digits. There are no other edge cases in the provided code, and since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases, the current implementation is sufficient.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and no additional edge cases are required, the program correctly follows the problem description.
