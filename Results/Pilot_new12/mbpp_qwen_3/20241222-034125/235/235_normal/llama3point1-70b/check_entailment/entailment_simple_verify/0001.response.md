Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that before the function call, `n` is a non-negative integer. The function converts `n` to a string, iterates over each character (which are digits), converts each character back to an integer, and then calculates the sum of these integers. This process correctly handles all valid inputs as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is supported by both the code and the annotations.
