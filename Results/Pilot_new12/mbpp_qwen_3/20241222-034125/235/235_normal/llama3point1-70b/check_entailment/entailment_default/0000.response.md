Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers. The code handles the edge case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. There are no other edge cases in the provided code, and it works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
