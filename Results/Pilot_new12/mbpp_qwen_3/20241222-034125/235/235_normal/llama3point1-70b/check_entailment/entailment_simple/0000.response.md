Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that `n` should be a non-negative integer. The program assumes that `n` is a valid non-negative integer and does not include explicit validation for this assumption.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The program converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This conversion allows each digit of `n` to be iterated over individually. The generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` then converts each character (which represents a digit) back to an integer, and `sum()` calculates the total sum of these integers.

3. **Output**: The function returns the computed sum, which matches the requirement to return the sum of the digits of the input number.

Since the program correctly implements the described functionality for all valid inputs (non-negative integers), it is considered correct according to the given problem description.
