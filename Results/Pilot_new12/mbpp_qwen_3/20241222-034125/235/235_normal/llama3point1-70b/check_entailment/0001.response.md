Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and then calculates the sum of these integers using Python's built-in `sum` function. This approach correctly computes the sum of the digits of the given non-negative integer for all potential cases. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the described problem.
