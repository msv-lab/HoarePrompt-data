The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It achieves this by converting the integer `n` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string representation, converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integers. The function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. No other edge cases are present in the provided code.
