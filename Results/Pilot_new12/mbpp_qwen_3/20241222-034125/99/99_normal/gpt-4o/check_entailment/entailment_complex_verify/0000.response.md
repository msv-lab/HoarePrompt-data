Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The annotations confirm that the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string, selecting only the characters at even indices, and then joins these characters into a new string. The provided assertions also correctly demonstrate the function's behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
