Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The annotations support this by indicating that the function returns a string containing every second character of the original string, starting from the first character (index 0). The provided assertions also correctly demonstrate the function's behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
