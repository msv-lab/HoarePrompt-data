Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only characters with even indices. The assertions provided also correctly validate this behavior:

- `func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`: This is correct because 'a', 'c', and 'e' are at even indices (0, 2, 4).
- `func_1('python') == 'pto'`: This is correct because 'p', 't', and 'o' are at even indices (0, 2, 4).
- `func_1('data') == 'dt'`: This is correct because 'd' and 't' are at even indices (0, 2).
- `func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`: This is correct because 'l', 'm', and 's' are at even indices (0, 2, 4).

Since the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
