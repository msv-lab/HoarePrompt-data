Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values by selecting only characters at even indices. The output hints confirm that the function iterates over the string, selects characters at even indices, and joins them into a new string. The provided assertions validate this behavior, and the function works correctly for any non-empty string, returning an empty string for an empty input. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
