Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the first character (index 0). This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over the indices of the string, selecting only those indices where `i % 2 == 0`. The selected characters are then joined together into a new string. 

To verify, let's consider the provided test cases:

- `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`: Characters at even indices (1, 3, 5) are skipped, leaving 'a', 'c', 'e'.
- `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`: Characters at even indices (1, 3, 5) are skipped, leaving 'p', 't', 'o'.
- `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`: Characters at even indices (1, 3) are skipped, leaving 'd', 't'.
- `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`: Characters at even indices (1, 3, 5) are skipped, leaving 'l', 'm', 's'.

In each case, the function correctly returns a string containing every second character of the input string, starting from the first character. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
