Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values, as specified in the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function uses a list comprehension to select characters at even indices (starting from index 0) and then joins them into a new string. The provided assertions also correctly demonstrate the function's behavior for various input strings. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
