Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of the original string, starting from the first character (index 0). This matches the requirement to remove characters with odd index values.

The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string, selecting only those indices that are even (`i % 2 == 0`). Then, it joins these selected characters back into a single string using `''.join()`. 

Here are some examples provided in the annotations:
- `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`
- `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`
- `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`
- `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`

Each of these examples correctly removes characters at odd indices, confirming that the program meets the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
