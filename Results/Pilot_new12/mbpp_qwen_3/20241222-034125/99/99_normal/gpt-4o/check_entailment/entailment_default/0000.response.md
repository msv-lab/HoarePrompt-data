Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string, selecting only the characters at even indices (where `i % 2 == 0`). The function then joins these characters into a new string. Based on the problem description and the provided assertions, the function works as expected for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
