The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the first character (index 0). The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s`, selecting only the characters at even indices (since `i % 2 == 0`), and then joins these characters into a new string. This process effectively skips every other character in the original string, beginning with the first character. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the provided code, but the function will work correctly for any non-empty string. If `s` is empty, the function will return an empty string.
