Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. It iterates over the string using a step of 2 in the range function, which effectively skips characters at odd indices and concatenates the characters at even indices. This meets the requirement of removing characters with odd index values for any given string input. Therefore, there is no potential case found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
