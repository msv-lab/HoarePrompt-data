Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(s)` removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. The provided code iterates over the string using a step of 2, which skips characters at odd indices and concatenates the characters at even indices. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. There are no contradictions or additional issues highlighted by the output hints that would necessitate changing the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
