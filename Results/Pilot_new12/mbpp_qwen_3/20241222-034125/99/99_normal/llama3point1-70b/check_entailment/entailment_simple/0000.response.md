Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should remove characters with odd index values from the given string. 

The function uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string `s` with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This effectively selects every character at even indices (i.e., with even index values). Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
