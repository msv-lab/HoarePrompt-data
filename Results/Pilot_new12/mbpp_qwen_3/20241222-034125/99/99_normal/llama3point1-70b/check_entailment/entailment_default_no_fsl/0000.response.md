Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s`. It uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string, selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The function handles all potential cases:

- An empty string will result in an empty string.
- A string with only one character will return that single character.
- For strings with more than one character, it correctly returns a new string containing every second character starting from the first character.

Since the function behaves as expected for all described cases and the problem description is met, the correctness is True.
