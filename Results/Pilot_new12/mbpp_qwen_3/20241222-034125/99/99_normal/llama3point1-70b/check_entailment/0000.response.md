Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. It iterates over the string using a step of 2 in the generator expression, which effectively skips every character with an odd index. This approach ensures that only characters with even index values are included in the returned string, meeting the problem description for all potential cases. Since no counterexample can be found where this program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
