Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. The function iterates over the string using a step of 2 in the range function, effectively skipping characters at odd indices and concatenating the characters at even indices. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the removal of characters with odd index values. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
