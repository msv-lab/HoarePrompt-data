Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `join` method, where the index `i` ranges from 0 to the length of the string with a step of 2 (`range(0, len(s), 2)`). 

The program handles all valid cases as per the problem description:
- For an empty string, the returned string will also be empty.
- For a string with only one character, the returned string will be the single character itself.

Since the program accurately performs the required operation without any missing functionalities and handles the mentioned edge cases, it meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is True.
