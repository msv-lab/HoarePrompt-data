Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `join` method, which iterates over the string starting from index 0 and increments by 2, effectively skipping characters at odd indices.

Given the problem description, the function should remove characters with odd index values, and the provided code does exactly that. The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This matches the problem description perfectly for every potential case, including edge cases like an empty string or a string with only one character.
