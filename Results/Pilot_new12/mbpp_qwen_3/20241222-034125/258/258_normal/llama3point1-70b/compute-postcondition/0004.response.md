The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` updates the value of `sum`. Here, `digit` is a part of `num_str`, which is a string representation of the integer `num`. Since `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, we need to consider that `digit` is one of the characters in `num_str` converted to an integer. 

Let's assume `num_str` is "123" for the sake of this example (the actual value does not change the structure of the answer):

- `num_str` is "123", so `num_len` is 3.
- `digit` would be one of the characters from "123", for instance, let's take '1'.

The code then performs `sum += int('1') ** 3`, which translates to `sum += 1 ** 3`, resulting in `sum += 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is an integer
- `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`
- `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`
- `sum` is 0

After executing the code, `sum` is updated to `1`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 1**
