State before the loop starts: `num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop `for digit in num_str:` iterates over each character (digit) in the string `num_str`.
2. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must contain at least one character (digit). If `num_str` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` are all initialized based on `num` at the start.
4. `sum` is given as 0, and it is used within the loop to accumulate the sum of digits, but its initial value does not affect whether the loop executes.

So, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `num_str` is not empty.

State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 0**
