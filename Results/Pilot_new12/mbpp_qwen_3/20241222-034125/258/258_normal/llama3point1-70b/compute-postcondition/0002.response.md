The code initializes a variable `sum` to 0, but it does not assign any value to it through operations involving other variables. The values of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 0.**
