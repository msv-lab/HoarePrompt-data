`sum` is incremented by the value of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. Since `num_len` is the initial length of `num_str` minus 1, and `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, the value of `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1. 

For example, if `num_str` is "123", then `num_len` is 2 (since the length of "123" is 3, and 3-1=2), and the code would add `int("1") ** 2 + int("2") ** 2 + int("3") ** 2` to `sum`.

Since the exact value of `num_str` is not specified, we can generalize this as follows:

- `num` remains an integer.
- `num_str` remains a non-empty string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` remains the length of `num_str` minus 1.
- `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`, where `digit` is each character in `num_str` converted to an integer.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1; `sum` is 1 plus the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
