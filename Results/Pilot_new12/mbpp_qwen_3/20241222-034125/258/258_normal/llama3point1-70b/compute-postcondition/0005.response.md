Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`.
   - `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`.
   - `sum` is 1.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for digit in num_str:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `num_str`.
   - Each iteration of the loop processes one digit from `num_str`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume we have completed one iteration of the loop. This means one digit has been processed.
   - After processing one digit, `num_str` is now one character shorter than it was initially.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `num` remains the same since it is the integer representation of the string, and only one digit has been processed.
   - `num_str` is now one character shorter, so the new length is `num_len - 1`.
   - `num_len` should be decremented by 1.
   - `sum` remains 1 as the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `sum`.

6. **New State**:
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `num_str` is now one character shorter.
   - `num_len` is decreased by 1.
   - `sum` remains 1.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is one less than the initial length; `sum` is 1**. 

To explicitly state the final answer:

State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the initial length minus 1; `sum` is 1**.
