Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.**

Edge Cases:
- If `num` is a single-digit number (e.g., 5), the loop will not execute, and `sum` will remain 0. The function will return `False` because `0 != num`.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotations and code do not explicitly handle negative integers. While the current code works for positive integers, it does not account for the case where `num` is negative. If `num` is negative, the function should either raise an exception or handle it appropriately based on the intended behavior.
