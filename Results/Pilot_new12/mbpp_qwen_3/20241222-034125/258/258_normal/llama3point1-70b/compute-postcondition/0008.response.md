The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the integer value of `digit` raised to the power of `num_len`. Since `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, we need to consider the current value of `num_str` and its length to determine the new value of `sum`.

Let's assume the initial values are:
- `num_str` is "123"
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, which is `3 - 1 = 2`

The first iteration would take `digit` as '1', so:
- `sum` is initially `1 + (1^2) = 2`

After the first iteration:
- `sum` is `2`
- `digit` is now '2'
- `num_len` remains `2`

The second iteration would take `digit` as '2', so:
- `sum` is updated to `2 + (2^2) = 2 + 4 = 6`

After the second iteration:
- `sum` is `6`
- `digit` is now '3'
- `num_len` remains `2`

The third iteration would take `digit` as '3', so:
- `sum` is updated to `6 + (3^2) = 6 + 9 = 15`

After the third iteration:
- `sum` is `15`
- `digit` is now '3' (since `num_str` has been fully iterated over)

Therefore, the final state is:
- `num` is an integer (unchanged)
- `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` (unchanged)
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1 (unchanged)
- `sum` is `15`

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is 15**
