Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`.
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1.
   - `sum` is 1 plus the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.

2. **For Loop Structure**:
   ```python
   for digit in num_str:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `num_str`, treating each character as a digit.
   - Each iteration of the loop modifies the state of `sum` based on the current digit.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.
   - `num_len` remains unchanged as it is derived from `num_str` which does not change within the loop.
   - `sum` is updated according to the formula: `sum += int(digit) ** num_len`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `num_str` should be processed.
   - This means `digit` should be set to the next character in `num_str`.

6. **Updated State**:
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `num_str` remains the same (no changes inside the loop).
   - `num_len` remains the same.
   - `sum` is updated by the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows for the loop to execute one more time:

- `digit` is now the next character in `num_str`.
- `sum` is updated based on the previous iteration.

The updated state is:
State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1; `sum` is 1 plus the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, where `digit` is now the next character in `num_str`.**
