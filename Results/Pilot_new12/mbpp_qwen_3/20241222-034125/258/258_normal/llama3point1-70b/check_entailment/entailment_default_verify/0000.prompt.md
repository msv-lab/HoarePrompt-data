You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly check if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. However, the program incorrectly raises each digit to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, rather than the number of digits. For example, for the number 153 (which is an Armstrong number), the program would calculate \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) instead of \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\), which would still be 153. But for a number like 9474, which is also an Armstrong number, the program would calculate \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4\), which is not equal to 9474.

To fix this, the exponentiation should use `num_len` instead of `len(num_str)`, which is already correctly implemented in the given code. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements for checking Armstrong numbers for all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
