Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (or a narcissistic number). The function converts the number to a string to determine its length, iterates over each digit, raises each digit to the power of the number's length, and sums these values. Finally, it compares this sum to the original number. The function works correctly for all potential cases, including single-digit numbers and multi-digit numbers. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the code, and no counterexamples were found where the program fails to meet the requirements.
