You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `num` is an integer.
    #- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for digit in num_str:
    #    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (Loop executes 1 time):**
    #   - `sum` is incremented by `int(digit[0]) ** num_len`.
    #   - `num_len` remains the same since it doesn't change within the loop body.
    #   - After the first iteration, `sum` becomes the first digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration (Loop executes 2 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the second digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration (Loop executes 3 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the third digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 2`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 again.
    #
    #4. **General Iteration (Loop executes k times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the k-th digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - (k-1)`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
    #
    #5. **Final Iteration (Loop executes num_len times):**
    #   - The loop continues until `num_len` becomes 0.
    #   - At this point, `sum` contains the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `num` is an integer whose string representation is `num_str`.
    #- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position in the string.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The loop will execute exactly `num_len` times, updating `sum` with the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #``num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #```
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position equals the original integer `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
