Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check whether the given number is an Armstrong number.
2. **Implementation**:
   - The function converts the number to a string (`num_str`) to easily iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the length of the string (`num_len`), which represents the number of digits in the original number.
   - A loop iterates over each character in `num_str`, converting it back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. The results are summed up.
   - Finally, the function returns `True` if the calculated sum is equal to the original number, otherwise it returns `False`.

The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description accurately. It correctly converts the number to a string, iterates over each digit, raises each digit to the power of the total number of digits, and sums them. The final check compares this sum to the original number, ensuring the function returns the correct boolean value. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
