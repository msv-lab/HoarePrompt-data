Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly check if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. However, the program incorrectly raises each digit to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, rather than the number of digits. For example, for the number 153 (which is an Armstrong number), the program would calculate \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) instead of \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\), which would still be 153. But for a number like 9474, which is also an Armstrong number, the program would calculate \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4\), which is not equal to 9474.

To fix this, the exponentiation should use `num_len` instead of `len(num_str)`, which is already correctly implemented in the given code. Therefore, the given program does not meet the requirements for checking Armstrong numbers for all cases.
