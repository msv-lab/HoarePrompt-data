Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number by converting the number to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of the number of digits, summing these values, and comparing the result to the original number. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the function, confirming that it correctly handles all relevant cases, including the special case of single-digit numbers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and should be maintained.
