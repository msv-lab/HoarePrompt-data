You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits). The function converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly without any missing logic or edge cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `num` is an integer.
    #- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for digit in num_str:
    #    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (Loop executes 1 time):**
    #   - `sum` is incremented by `int(digit[0]) ** num_len`.
    #   - `num_len` remains the same since it doesn't change within the loop body.
    #   - After the first iteration, `sum` becomes the first digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration (Loop executes 2 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the second digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration (Loop executes 3 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the third digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 2`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 again.
    #
    #4. **General Iteration (Loop executes k times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the k-th digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - (k-1)`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
    #
    #5. **Final Iteration (Loop executes num_len times):**
    #   - The loop continues until `num_len` becomes 0.
    #   - At this point, `sum` contains the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `num` is an integer whose string representation is `num_str`.
    #- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position in the string.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The loop will execute exactly `num_len` times, updating `sum` with the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #``num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #```
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position equals the original integer `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
