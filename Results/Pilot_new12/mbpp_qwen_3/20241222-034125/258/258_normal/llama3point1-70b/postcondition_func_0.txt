The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.
