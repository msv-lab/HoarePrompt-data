#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `num` is an integer.
    #- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is an integer representing the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is 0.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for digit in num_str:
    #    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration (Loop executes 1 time):**
    #   - `sum` is incremented by `int(digit[0]) ** num_len`.
    #   - `num_len` remains the same since it doesn't change within the loop body.
    #   - After the first iteration, `sum` becomes the first digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration (Loop executes 2 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the second digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration (Loop executes 3 times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the third digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - 2`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 again.
    #
    #4. **General Iteration (Loop executes k times):**
    #   - `sum` is updated by adding the k-th digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len - (k-1)`.
    #   - `num_len` decreases by 1 with each iteration.
    #
    #5. **Final Iteration (Loop executes num_len times):**
    #   - The loop continues until `num_len` becomes 0.
    #   - At this point, `sum` contains the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #
    #- `num` is an integer whose string representation is `num_str`.
    #- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
    #- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.
    #- `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position in the string.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The loop will execute exactly `num_len` times, updating `sum` with the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #``num` is an integer; `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position.
    #```
    return sum == num
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit of `num_str` raised to the power of its respective position equals the original integer `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` and calculates the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of its respective position in the string representation of `num`. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether this calculated sum equals the original integer `num`. This process involves converting `num` to a string, iterating over each digit, raising it to the power of its position, and summing these values. The function handles the case where `num` is a single-digit number, as the loop would not execute in such a scenario.
