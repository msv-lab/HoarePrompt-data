Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program checks if a number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to the original number. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly implements this logic, but the original assessment correctly pointed out that the program should return `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number. The current implementation in the program already correctly performs this check (`return armstrong_sum == n`). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
