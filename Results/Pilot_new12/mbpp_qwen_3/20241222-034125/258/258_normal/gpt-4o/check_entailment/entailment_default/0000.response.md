Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1` converts the number to a string, calculates the length of the string (which is the number of digits), and then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. If this sum equals the original number, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles edge cases correctly:
- For a single-digit number (e.g., 1, 2, ..., 9), raising each digit to the power of 1 gives the digit itself, which matches the number.
- For a multi-digit number (e.g., 153, 370, 371, 407), the function correctly computes the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if it equals the original number.

The given assertions (`assert func_1(153) == True`, `assert func_1(259) == False`, `assert func_1(4458) == False`) confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
