Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong (or narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is a non-negative integer as stated in the problem description.
2. **Digit Extraction and Sum Calculation**: The program converts the number to a string (`num_str`) and calculates the length of this string (`num_len`). It then computes the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.
3. **Comparison and Return**: The function returns `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided in the annotated program test different cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

Since the program correctly checks whether a number is an Armstrong number based on the definition provided in the problem description, the program is correct.
