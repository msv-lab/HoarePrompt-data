You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program checks if a number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to the original number. However, this logic is flawed because an Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

The program should compare `armstrong_sum` to `n`, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect. Specifically, the line `right = mid - 1` in the binary search example should be `right = mid` to correctly narrow down the search range. This mistake does not directly affect the Armstrong number check, but the logic in the provided program is still incorrect.

For instance, consider the number 1634, which is also an Armstrong number because \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634\). The provided program will incorrectly return `False` for 1634 because it does not properly calculate the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

To fix the program, the logic should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

This corrected version should correctly identify Armstrong numbers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #`The program returns True if the sum of the digits of `num_str` each raised to the power of `num_len` is equal to `n`, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals `n`. If this condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which is an Armstrong number), or when `n` is a single-digit number (as the sum of a single digit raised to the power of 1 is the digit itself). The function correctly handles these cases and no additional functionality is missing.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
