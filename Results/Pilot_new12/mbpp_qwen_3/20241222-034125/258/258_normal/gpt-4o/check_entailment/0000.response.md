Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program checks if a number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to the original number. However, this logic is flawed because an Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

The program should compare `armstrong_sum` to `n`, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect. Specifically, the line `right = mid - 1` in the binary search example should be `right = mid` to correctly narrow down the search range. This mistake does not directly affect the Armstrong number check, but the logic in the provided program is still incorrect.

For instance, consider the number 1634, which is also an Armstrong number because \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634\). The provided program will incorrectly return `False` for 1634 because it does not properly calculate the sum of the digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

To fix the program, the logic should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

This corrected version should correctly identify Armstrong numbers.
