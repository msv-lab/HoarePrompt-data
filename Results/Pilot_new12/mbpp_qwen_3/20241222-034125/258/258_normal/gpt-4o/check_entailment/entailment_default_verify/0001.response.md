Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The provided code converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, raises each digit to the power of the number of digits, sums these values, and compares the result to the original number. This aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number. The output hints also confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 or a single-digit number. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
