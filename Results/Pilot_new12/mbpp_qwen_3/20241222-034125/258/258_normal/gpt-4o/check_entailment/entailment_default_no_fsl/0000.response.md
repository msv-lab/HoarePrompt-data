Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. It converts the number to a string to determine the number of digits, then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and finally compares this sum to the original number. The test cases given also correctly assert that 153 is an Armstrong number, 259 is not, and 4458 is not. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers and zero correctly. Since the function meets the problem description for all potential cases and the test cases and hints support this, the program is correct.
