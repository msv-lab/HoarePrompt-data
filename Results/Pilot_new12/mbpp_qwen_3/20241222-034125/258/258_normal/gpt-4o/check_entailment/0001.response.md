Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong (or narcissistic) number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the power of each digit to the length of the number, sums these values, and compares the result to the original number. The assertions provided also correctly validate this logic for the given test cases. Since the function works correctly for the provided examples and the logic aligns with the definition of an Armstrong number, the program is correct.
