Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotations clarify that the function converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the power of each digit to the length of the number, sums these values, and compares the result to the original number. The provided assertions also validate this logic for the given test cases. The function correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 or a single-digit number. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is maintained.
