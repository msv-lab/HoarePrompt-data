Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. The output hints also accurately summarize the functionality of the program, indicating that it correctly checks whether the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number. The original assessment incorrectly flagged the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the logic required for checking Armstrong numbers. The provided code and the corrected logic align perfectly with the problem description and the expected behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.
