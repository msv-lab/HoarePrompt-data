Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotated version of the code supports this understanding:

1. The function takes a non-negative integer `n`.
2. It converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
3. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. It returns `True` if the calculated sum is equal to the original number, and `False` otherwise.

The provided assertions also correctly validate the function's logic for the given test cases. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
