The code calculates the Armstrong sum of the number represented by `num_str`. The Armstrong sum is computed by raising each digit of the number to the power of the number of digits in the number and then summing these values.

Let's assume `n` is a specific non-negative integer. We need to find `num_str`, which is the string representation of `n`, and `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`.

For example, if `n = 153`, then:
- `num_str` would be "153"
- `num_len` would be 3

The code then calculates the Armstrong sum as follows:
```python
armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
```
Breaking it down:
- Convert each digit in `num_str` to an integer.
- Raise each digit to the power of `num_len`.
- Sum the results.

For `n = 153`:
- Digits are "1", "5", "3".
- `num_len` is 3.
- The Armstrong sum is \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

After executing the code, the value of `armstrong_sum` will be the calculated Armstrong sum, while `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, and `armstrong_sum` is the sum of the digits of `num_str` each raised to the power of `num_len`.**
