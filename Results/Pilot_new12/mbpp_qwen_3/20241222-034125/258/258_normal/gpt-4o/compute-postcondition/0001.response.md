The code `num_len = len(num_str)` assigns the length of the string `num_str` to the variable `num_len`. Since `num_str` is the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`, the value of `num_len` will be the number of digits in `n`.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer and `num_str` is its string representation, `num_len` will be the length of this string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
