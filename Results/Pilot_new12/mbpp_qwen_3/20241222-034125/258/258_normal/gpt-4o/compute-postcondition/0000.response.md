`num_str` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the non-negative integer `n` into a string. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`.**
