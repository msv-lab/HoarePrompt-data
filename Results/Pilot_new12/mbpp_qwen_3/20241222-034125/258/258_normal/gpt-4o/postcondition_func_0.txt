The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals `n`. If this condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 0 (which is an Armstrong number), or when `n` is a single-digit number (as the sum of a single digit raised to the power of 1 is the digit itself). The function correctly handles these cases and no additional functionality is missing.
