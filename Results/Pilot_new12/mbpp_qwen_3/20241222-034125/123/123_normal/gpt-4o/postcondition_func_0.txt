The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters. It returns two lists: the first list contains all elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains all elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This division is performed using list slicing, which handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 (returning an empty list for the first slice and the entire list for the second) or when `L` equals the length of `lst` (returning the entire list for the first slice and an empty list for the second).
