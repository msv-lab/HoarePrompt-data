Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. It then splits the list into two parts where the first part contains the first `L` elements, and the second part contains the remaining elements starting from index `L`. This is achieved using list slicing with `lst[:L]` for the first part and `lst[L:]` for the second part.

The function returns these two parts as a tuple, which matches the requirement to return the resulting lists in a tuple. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, further validating its correctness according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
