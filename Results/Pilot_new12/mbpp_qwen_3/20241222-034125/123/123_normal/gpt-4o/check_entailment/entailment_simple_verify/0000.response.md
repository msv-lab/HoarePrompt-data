Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the goal is to split a given list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`. The provided function `func_1` achieves this by using Python's list slicing, which is correctly implemented. The annotations clearly explain that the function returns two lists: one from the start of the input list up to but not including index `L`, and the other from index `L` to the end of the list. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
