Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the program's implementation. The function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The output hints also confirm this behavior, indicating that the function uses list slicing to achieve the desired outcome. The provided test cases and the general logic of the function support the conclusion that the program meets the problem description and is correct.
