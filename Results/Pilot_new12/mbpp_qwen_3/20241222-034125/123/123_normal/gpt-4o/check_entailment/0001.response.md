Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The function uses list slicing to achieve this, which works for all potential cases. The provided test cases cover different types of inputs (integers and strings) and lengths, and the function passes all these tests. Since the function handles the given requirements without any issues, it can be considered correct for all potential cases.
