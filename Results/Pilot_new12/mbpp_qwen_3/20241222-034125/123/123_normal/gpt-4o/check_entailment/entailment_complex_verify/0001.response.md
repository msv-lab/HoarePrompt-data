Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The annotations clearly describe the behavior of the function, stating that it returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This matches the problem description perfectly. Additionally, the provided test cases cover various scenarios (including edge cases like `L` being 0 or equal to the length of the list) and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
