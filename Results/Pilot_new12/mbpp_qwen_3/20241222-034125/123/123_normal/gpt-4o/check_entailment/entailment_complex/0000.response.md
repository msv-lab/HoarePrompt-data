Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing two lists:
   - The first list is obtained by slicing the original list from the start up to but not including the element at index `L` (`lst[:L]`).
   - The second list is obtained by slicing the original list from index `L` to the end (`lst[L:]`).

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - When `L = 0`, the first list is an empty list, and the second list contains all elements of `lst`.
   - When `L = len(lst)`, the first list contains all elements of `lst`, and the second list is an empty list.
   - The slicing operation correctly handles these edge cases, ensuring the returned lists match the expected output for all valid values of `L`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases verify the correctness of the function across different scenarios:
     - Splitting a list with multiple elements (`[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` split at index 3).
     - Splitting a list with multiple elements of the same type (`['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` split at index 2).
     - Splitting a list with string elements (`['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']` split at index 4).

Since the function `func_1` meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all relevant edge cases correctly, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
