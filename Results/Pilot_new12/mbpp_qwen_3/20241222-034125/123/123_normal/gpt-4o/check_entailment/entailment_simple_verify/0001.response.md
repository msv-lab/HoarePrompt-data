Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The annotated version clarifies that the function returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The provided test cases cover various scenarios (including lists of different data types and lengths), and the function passes all these tests. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
