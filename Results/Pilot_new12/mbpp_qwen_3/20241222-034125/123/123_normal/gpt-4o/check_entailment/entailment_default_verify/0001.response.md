Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases like when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function uses list slicing to achieve this, which handles all the mentioned edge cases properly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
