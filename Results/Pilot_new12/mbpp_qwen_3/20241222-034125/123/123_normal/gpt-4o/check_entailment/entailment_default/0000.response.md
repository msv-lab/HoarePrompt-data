Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters and returns a tuple containing two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements of `lst`. The code uses list slicing to achieve this, which correctly handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 (returning an empty list for the first slice and the entire list for the second) or when `L` equals the length of `lst` (returning the entire list for the first slice and an empty list for the second).

Given the test cases provided:

- `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`
- `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)` returns `( ['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'] )`
- `func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4)` returns `( ['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'] )`

The function works correctly for these cases. The output hints also confirm that the slicing operation handles all potential cases appropriately. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
