Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the described functionality. It splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The code handles edge cases such as when `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list. For example:
- When `L` is 0, the function returns `([], original_list)`.
- When `L` equals the length of the list, the function returns `(original_list, [])`.

The examples provided in the problem description and the output hints all show that the function works as expected for different inputs, confirming its correctness.
