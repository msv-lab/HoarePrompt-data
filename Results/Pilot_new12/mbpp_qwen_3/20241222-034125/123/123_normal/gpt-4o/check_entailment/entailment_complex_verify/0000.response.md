Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies that the function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The function handles the examples provided and the explanations in the annotations align with the behavior observed in the code. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is supported by the annotated version and the problem description.
