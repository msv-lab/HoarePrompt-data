Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple containing two slices: the first slice is a part of `lst` from the start up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice is the remaining part of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end. This function ensures that the original list `lst` remains unchanged and only the slices are returned. If `L` is `0`, the first slice will be an empty list, and if `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the second slice will be an empty list.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- When `L` is `0`, the first slice (`lst[:L]`) will be an empty list, and the second slice (`lst[L:]`) will be the entire original list `lst`.
- When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first slice (`lst[:L]`) will be the entire original list `lst`, and the second slice (`lst[L:]`) will be an empty list.
- The function does not modify the original list `lst`; it only returns slices of `lst`.
