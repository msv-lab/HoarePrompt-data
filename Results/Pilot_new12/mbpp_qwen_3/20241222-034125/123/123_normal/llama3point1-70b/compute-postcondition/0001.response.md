The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The function returns a tuple containing two slices: `lst[:L]`, which is a slice of `lst` up to index `L`, and `lst[L:]`, which is a slice of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return a tuple with two elements: a slice of `lst` up to index `L` and a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end.
