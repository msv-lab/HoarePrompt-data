Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it returns a tuple containing two slices of the list: the first slice includes elements from the start of the list up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice includes the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. This exactly matches the requirement stated in the problem description. The function ensures that the original list `lst` remains unchanged, and it handles all valid cases where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. Therefore, the program is correct.
