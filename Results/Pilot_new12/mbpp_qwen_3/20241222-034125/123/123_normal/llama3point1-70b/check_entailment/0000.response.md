Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is L. The function returns a tuple containing these two parts. This satisfies the problem description for any valid input list and integer L. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
