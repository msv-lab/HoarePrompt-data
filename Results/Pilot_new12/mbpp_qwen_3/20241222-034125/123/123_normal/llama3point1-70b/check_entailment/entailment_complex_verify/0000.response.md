Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The annotations clearly state that `lst[:L]` is a slice of `lst` up to index `L`, and `lst[L:]` is a slice of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function that takes a list and an integer `L` and returns two lists in a tuple, where the first list has a length of `L`.

The annotations also confirm that the function works correctly for any valid input list and integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is justified and maintained.
