Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer L. The first part contains the first L elements of the list, and the second part contains the remaining elements. This satisfies the problem description for any list and any value of L where 0 ≤ L ≤ len(lst). There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as L is within the valid range.
