Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of splitting the list into two parts based on the given integer L. The output hints further clarify that the function returns a tuple containing two slices of the original list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function handles edge cases such as when L is 0 or L is equal to the length of the list, returning an empty list as appropriate. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is maintained as True.
