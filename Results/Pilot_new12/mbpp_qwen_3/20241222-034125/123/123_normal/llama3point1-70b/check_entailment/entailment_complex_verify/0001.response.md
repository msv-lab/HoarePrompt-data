Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The function returns a tuple containing two slices of the original list: the first slice includes elements from the start up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice includes the remaining elements starting from index `L`. This behavior aligns with the problem description, which asks for splitting the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The annotated version further clarifies that the function ensures the original list remains unchanged, and it handles edge cases such as when `L` is `0` or equal to the length of the list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
