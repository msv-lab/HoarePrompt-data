Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple containing two slices of the list: the first slice has a length of `L` and the second slice contains the remaining elements of the list. The function handles all potential cases where `0 <= L <= len(lst)` and returns the correct slices. For example:
- When `L` is `0`, the first slice is an empty list, and the second slice is the entire list.
- When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first slice is the entire list, and the second slice is an empty list.
- When `0 < L < len(lst)`, both slices contain the appropriate segments of the list.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the code is correct according to the problem description.
