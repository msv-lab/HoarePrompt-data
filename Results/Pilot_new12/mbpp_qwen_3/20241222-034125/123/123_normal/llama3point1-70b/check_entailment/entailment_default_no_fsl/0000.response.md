Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:
- When `L` is `0`, the first slice is an empty list, and the second slice contains all elements of the original list.
- When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first slice contains all elements of the original list, and the second slice is an empty list.
- For any other value of `L`, the first slice contains the elements from the start up to but not including `L`, and the second slice contains the remaining elements.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case and handles all specified scenarios correctly, the correctness is **True**.
