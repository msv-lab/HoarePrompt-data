Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple of two slices from the list, where the first slice has a length of `L` and the second slice contains the remaining elements. The output hints further clarify that this behavior holds true for all valid inputs, including edge cases like when `L` is `0` or equal to the length of the list. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate and supported by the provided code and output hints.
