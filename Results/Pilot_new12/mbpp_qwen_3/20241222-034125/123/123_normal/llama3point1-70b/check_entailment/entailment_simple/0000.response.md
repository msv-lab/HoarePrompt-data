Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It then slices the list into two parts: the first part contains elements from the start of the list up to index `L`, and the second part contains elements from index `L` to the end of the list. These two parts are returned as a tuple.

The problem description specifies that the function should split the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and it correctly achieves this using the slicing notation `lst[:L]` for the first part and `lst[L:]` for the second part. This ensures that the first part has exactly `L` elements, and the second part contains the remaining elements of the list.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
