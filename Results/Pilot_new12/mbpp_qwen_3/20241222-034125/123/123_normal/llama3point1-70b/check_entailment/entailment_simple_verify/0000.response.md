Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The annotation clearly states that before the function call, `lst` is a list and `L` is an integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which ensures that the slicing operations will not raise any out-of-bounds errors. The function returns a tuple containing these two parts, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
