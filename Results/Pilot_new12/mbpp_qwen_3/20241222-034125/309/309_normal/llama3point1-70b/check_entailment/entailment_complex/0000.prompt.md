You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string 's' are the same, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are identical, otherwise it returns `False`. It achieves this by converting the string `s` into a set of its characters and checking if the length of this set is 1. This means that if all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one element, resulting in the function returning `True`. If the string contains at least one different character, the set will have more than one element, causing the function to return `False`. The function handles the case where the input string is non-empty, as explicitly stated in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
