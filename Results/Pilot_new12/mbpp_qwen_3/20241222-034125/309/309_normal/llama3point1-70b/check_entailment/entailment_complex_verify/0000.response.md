Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is 1. The annotation explicitly states that the function handles the case where the input string is non-empty, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description, and there is no indication from the annotations that the original assessment should be changed.
