Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This method ensures that if all characters are identical, the set will contain only one unique element. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same and `False` otherwise. Since the input `s` is assumed to be a non-empty string, the function handles this case correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
