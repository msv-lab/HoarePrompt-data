Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is 1. This logic works for all potential cases where the input string is non-empty. The function handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement and output hints, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the function does not address.
