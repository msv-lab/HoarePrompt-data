Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes that the function `func_1(s)` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires a function to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function handles the case where the input string is non-empty, as stated in the annotations. Since the annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
