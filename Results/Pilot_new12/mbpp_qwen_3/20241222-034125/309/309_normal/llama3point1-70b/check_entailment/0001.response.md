Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic is correct because a set contains only unique elements, so if all characters are the same, the set will contain only one element. This function will work correctly for all potential cases as it handles both empty strings and strings with all identical characters.
