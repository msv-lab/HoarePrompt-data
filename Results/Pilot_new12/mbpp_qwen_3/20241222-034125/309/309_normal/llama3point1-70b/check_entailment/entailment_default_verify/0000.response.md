Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is 1. The output hints further clarify that the function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters are identical, otherwise `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of checking whether all characters in a string are the same. The function handles all relevant cases as per the problem statement and the output hints, making the original assessment of correctness **True** valid.
