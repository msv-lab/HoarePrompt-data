Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the set contains exactly one element. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all characters are the same and `False` otherwise. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a non-empty string), the function works as intended according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
