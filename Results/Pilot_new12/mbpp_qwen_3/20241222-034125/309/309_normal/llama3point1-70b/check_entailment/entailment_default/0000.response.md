Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether all characters in a string are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the set contains only one unique character. This approach correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. If all characters in the string are identical, the set will contain only one element, and the function will return `True`. If there is even one different character, the set will have more than one element, and the function will return `False`. The code handles non-empty strings appropriately and does not require additional checks for edge cases like empty strings or invalid inputs, as these are not specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement.
