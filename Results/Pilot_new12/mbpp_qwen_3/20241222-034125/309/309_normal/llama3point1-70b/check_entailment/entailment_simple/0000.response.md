Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that `s` is a non-empty string. The program implicitly assumes this because it directly uses `set(s)`, which would raise a `TypeError` if `s` is not a string. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program handles this correctly.

2. **Logic**: 
   - `set(s)` creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`.
   - `len(set(s)) == 1` checks if there is exactly one unique character in the set, which means all characters in the string are the same.
   - If the length of the set is 1, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For any string where all characters are the same (e.g., `"aaaa"`, `"bbb"`, `"x"`), the function returns `True`.
   - For any string with at least one different character (e.g., `"abc"`, `"abca"`, `"xyz"`), the function returns `False`.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, thus making it correct.
