Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given non-empty string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set of its characters and verifying if the length of the set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string are identical, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function correctly handles the case where the input string is non-empty, as specified in the problem description. If the string were empty, the function would still technically work (as `len(set("")) == 1`), but the problem description explicitly states that the string should be non-empty. Since the program does not include handling for an empty string, it implicitly adheres to the non-empty requirement.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
