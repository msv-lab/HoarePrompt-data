Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are identical, otherwise it returns `False`. It achieves this by converting the string `s` into a set of its characters and checking if the length of this set is 1. This means that if all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one element, resulting in the function returning `True`. If the string contains at least one different character, the set will have more than one element, causing the function to return `False`. The function handles the case where the input string is non-empty, as explicitly stated in the annotations.**

Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where the input string consists of a single character (e.g., "a"), which should return `True`.
- The function also correctly handles strings with multiple distinct characters (e.g., "abc"), which should return `False`.
- The function correctly ensures that the input string is non-empty. If an empty string is passed, the function would still attempt to create a set from an empty iterable, which would result in an empty set and thus `False`, but this case is implicitly handled by the requirement that `s` is non-empty.
