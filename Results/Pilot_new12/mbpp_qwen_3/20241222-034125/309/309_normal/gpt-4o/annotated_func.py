#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a non-empty string
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string where all characters are equal to `first_char`
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are identical. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first checks if the string is empty, which is not possible given the precondition that `s` is a non-empty string. It then determines the first character of the string and checks if every other character matches this first character. If any character differs, the function returns `False`. If all characters match, the function returns `True`. The function handles the case where the string consists of identical characters correctly, but the return postconditions mention `False` four times, which seems incorrect based on the provided code.
