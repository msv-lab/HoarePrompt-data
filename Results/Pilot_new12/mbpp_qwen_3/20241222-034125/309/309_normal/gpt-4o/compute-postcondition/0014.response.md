Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string where all characters are equal to `first_char`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- If any character `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`.
- For the loop to execute all iterations, it means every character in the string `s` must be equal to `first_char`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., the string `s` is empty), the function does not return anything explicitly, but since the initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string, this scenario does not apply.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the string `s` must consist entirely of the character `first_char`.
