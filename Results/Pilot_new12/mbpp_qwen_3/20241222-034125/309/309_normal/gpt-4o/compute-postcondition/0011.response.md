Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
   - `char` is the next character in `s` after the first one.
   - The condition for the function to return `False` is if `char` is not equal to `first_char`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the next character after `first_char`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`.
   - Since `char` was the next character after `first_char`, the next character to check (in the next iteration) would be the character after `char`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - `first_char` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `char` will now be the next character after the current `char`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `char` is equal to `first_char`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `char` must still be equal to `first_char` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is the next character in `s` after `first_char`, but now `char` is the next character after the previous `char`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s` after the previous `char`**.
