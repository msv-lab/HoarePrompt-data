Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is set to `first_char`.
- `char` is equal to `first_char`.

### Loop Condition
The loop is defined as:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
2. `char` starts as the first character of `s`.
3. For the loop to continue, `char` needs to be equal to the next character in `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
   - `char` is `first_char`.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `char` is the first character of `s`.
   - After the first iteration, `char` moves to the next character in `s`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be equal to the next character in `s`.
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string and we are iterating through it, there will always be at least one more character after the first one.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `char` becomes the next character in `s` after the first one.
   - The new `char` must be equal to the current character in `s`.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` is still a non-empty string.
- `char` is the next character in `s` after the first one.
- `char` must be equal to the current character in `s`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s` after the first one, and `char` is equal to the current character in `s`**
