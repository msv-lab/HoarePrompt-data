State before the loop starts: `s` is a non-empty string; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable**: The loop variable is `char`, which will take each character from the string `s`.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
3. **Initial values**: Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. Since `s` is already stated as a non-empty string, it satisfies this condition.

However, we need to consider the initial value of the loop variable `char`. Initially, `char` should be set to the first character of `s` because after the first iteration, `char` will be set to the next character in the string.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `char` is initially set to the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
