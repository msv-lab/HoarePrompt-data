The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in the string are identical. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first checks if the string is empty, which is not possible given the precondition that `s` is a non-empty string. It then determines the first character of the string and checks if every other character matches this first character. If any character differs, the function returns `False`. If all characters match, the function returns `True`. The function handles the case where the string consists of identical characters correctly, but the return postconditions mention `False` four times, which seems incorrect based on the provided code.
