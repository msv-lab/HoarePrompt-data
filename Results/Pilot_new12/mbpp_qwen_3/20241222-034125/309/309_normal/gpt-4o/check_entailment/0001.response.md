Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in a string are the same. The logic in the function is correct:

- If the string is empty (`if not s`), it returns `True`, which is correct since there are no different characters.
- It then compares each character in the string with the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The test cases provided also cover various scenarios:
- `'python'` (all characters are different) -> Expected output: `False` (Correct)
- `'aaa'` (all characters are the same) -> Expected output: `True` (Correct)
- `'data'` (not all characters are the same) -> Expected output: `False` (Correct)

Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases and the logic seems sound, the program is correct.
