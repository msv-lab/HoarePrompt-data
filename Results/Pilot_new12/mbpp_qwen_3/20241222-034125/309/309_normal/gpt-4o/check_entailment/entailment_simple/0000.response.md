Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. Here's why:

1. **Initial Check**: The program starts with an `if` condition to check if the string `s` is empty (`not s`). If the string is empty, it immediately returns `True`. An empty string technically has no differing characters, so returning `True` is correct in this context.

2. **Character Comparison**: If the string is not empty, the program sets `first_char` to the first character of the string. It then iterates over each character in the string using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it compares each character with `first_char`. If any character differs, it returns `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.

3. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The test cases provided also support this behavior:
- `func_1('python') == False`: This is correct because 'p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n' are all different.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: This is correct because 'a' is the same for all positions.
- `func_1('data') == False`: This is correct because 'd', 'a', 't', 'a' are not all the same.

Since the program meets the problem description for all valid cases, the correctness is **True**.
