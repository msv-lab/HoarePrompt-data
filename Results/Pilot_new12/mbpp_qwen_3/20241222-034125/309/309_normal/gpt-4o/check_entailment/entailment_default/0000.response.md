Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function first checks if the string is empty, although the problem description mentions that the input string `s` will always be a non-empty string. Given this assumption, this check is unnecessary. The function then iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character. If any character differs, the function returns `False`. If all characters match, the function returns `True`.

The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if all characters in the string are identical and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases (`assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, `assert func_1('data') == False`) also validate the function's behavior for different scenarios, including strings with all identical characters and those with different characters.

Since the function correctly implements the required logic for all potential cases described in the problem statement and the output hints, the correctness is **True**.
