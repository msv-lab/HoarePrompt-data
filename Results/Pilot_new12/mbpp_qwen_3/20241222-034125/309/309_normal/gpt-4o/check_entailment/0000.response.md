Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty string trivially has all characters the same. The function then iterates through the string and compares each character to the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration. The provided test cases also validate this behavior correctly:

- `func_1('python') == False`: The string 'python' has different characters.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: The string 'aaa' has the same character repeated.
- `func_1('data') == False`: The string 'data' has different characters.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and there are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, the function is correct.
