Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function works as follows:

1. It first checks if the string is empty. Given the problem description and the assertions, we can assume that the string is always non-empty.
2. It sets the `first_char` to the first character of the string.
3. It iterates through each character in the string and checks if it matches the `first_char`.
4. If any character does not match, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
- `func_1('python') == False`: All characters are different.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: All characters are the same.
- `func_1('data') == False`: Not all characters are the same.

The function handles these cases correctly. There are no edge cases or examples mentioned in the hints that suggest the function behaves incorrectly. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
