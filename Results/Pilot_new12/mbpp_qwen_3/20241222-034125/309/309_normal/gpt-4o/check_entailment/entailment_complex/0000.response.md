Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether all characters in a given non-empty string are the same. Here's a breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the string `s` is empty using `if (not s)`. Since the problem description specifies that the input is a non-empty string, this condition should not be reached, and the function returns `True` immediately in this case, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Character Comparison**: If the string is non-empty, the function sets `first_char` to the first character of the string. It then iterates through each character in the string and checks if it matches `first_char`. If any character does not match, the function returns `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.

3. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The function handles the case where the string consists of identical characters correctly and returns `True`. The provided assertions also validate this behavior:
- `assert func_1('python') == False` (correct, because 'python' has different characters)
- `assert func_1('aaa') == True` (correct, because 'aaa' has identical characters)
- `assert func_1('data') == False` (correct, because 'data' has different characters)

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, and the provided assertions pass, confirming its correctness.
