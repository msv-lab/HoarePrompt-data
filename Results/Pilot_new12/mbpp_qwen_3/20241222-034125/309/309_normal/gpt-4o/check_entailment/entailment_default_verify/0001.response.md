Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in a string are the same. The provided code logic is sound, and the test cases confirm its correctness. The output hints mention that the function returns `False` four times, which seems to be a misunderstanding. The function actually returns `False` only when it finds a character that is different from the first character, which aligns with the problem description and the test cases provided. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
