Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the goal is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotated version correctly identifies that the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is always even, as they are of the same size. However, the original implementation uses `size - 1` as the middle index, which is incorrect. According to the annotations, the middle indices for an even-sized merged list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. 

The original assessment correctly points out that the program's current implementation does not handle the even-sized lists correctly, leading to incorrect median calculations. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate given the current implementation.
