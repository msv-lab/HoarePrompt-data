You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program assumes that the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd when calculating the median. However, the problem description states that the two lists are of the same size, meaning their combined length is always even. Therefore, the calculation of the middle index should be adjusted to handle this even length correctly.

For instance, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, both of size 2, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The middle indices would be 1 and 2, and the median should be the average of the elements at these indices, which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

The current implementation incorrectly uses `size - 1` as the middle index, which leads to incorrect results. To fix this, the middle index should be calculated as `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2 - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This correction ensures that the program works correctly for all inputs where the two lists are of the same size.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
