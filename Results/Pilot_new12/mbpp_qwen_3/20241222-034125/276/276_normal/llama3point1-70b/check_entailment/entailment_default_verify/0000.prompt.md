You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd. The problem description specifies finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but the program attempts to find the median by sorting the merged list and then calculating the median based on the size being even or odd. However, if the combined length of the two lists is odd, the calculation of the median will be incorrect.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `list1 = [1, 3, 5]`
- `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`

The combined list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The median should be the average of the third and fourth elements, which are `3` and `4`, respectively. Therefore, the correct median is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.

However, the program will calculate the median using the middle element only, which in this case would be `4` (since the middle index is `2` and the size is even), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should handle the case when the combined length is odd by averaging the middle element and the next element in the sorted merged list.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
