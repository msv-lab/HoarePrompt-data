You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd. The problem description specifies finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but the program attempts to find the median by sorting the merged list and then calculating the median based on the size being even or odd. However, if the combined length of the two lists is odd, the calculation of the median will be incorrect.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `list1 = [1, 3, 5]`
- `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`

The combined list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The median should be the average of the third and fourth elements, which are `3` and `4`, respectively. Therefore, the correct median is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.

However, the program will calculate the median using the middle element only, which in this case would be `4` (since the middle index is `2` and the size is even), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should handle the case when the combined length is odd by averaging the middle element and the next element in the sorted merged list.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of `merged_list[size / 2 - 1]` and `merged_list[size / 2]`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is the average of merged_list[size / 2 - 1] and merged_list[size / 2] if size is even, or merged_list[size - 1] if size is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
