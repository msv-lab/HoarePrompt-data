Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. In the context of finding the median of two sorted lists, the middle index should account for the combined length of both lists, not just the length of one list.

Given two sorted lists `list1` and `list2`, each of size `size`, the median would be the average of the elements at indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` in the combined sorted list (if `size` is even), or simply the element at index `size - 1` (if `size` is odd).

However, in the provided code, the `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which is incorrect. It should be `size // 2 - 1` for the even case and `size - 1` for the odd case, but the logic should be applied correctly to the combined list's indices.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[size // 2 - 1] + merged_list[size // 2]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[size - 1]
    return median
```

In this corrected version, the median is calculated correctly based on the combined list's indices, ensuring that the program meets the problem description.
