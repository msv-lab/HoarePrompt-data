Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment was incorrect. The original assessment stated that the program assumes the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd when calculating the median, which is not the case here. The problem description states that the two lists are of the same size, so their combined length is always even. 

The revised code correctly handles the even length scenario by using `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2` as the indices for the two middle elements when calculating the median. The output hints confirm that the function correctly merges the two sorted lists and calculates the median for both even and odd total sizes of the merged list. Since the program now correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, the final assessment is True.
