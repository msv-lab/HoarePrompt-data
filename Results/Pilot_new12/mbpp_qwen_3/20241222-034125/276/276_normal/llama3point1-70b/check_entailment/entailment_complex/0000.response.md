Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that the inputs are two sorted lists of integers with the same size and a positive integer representing the size. Although the program doesn't explicitly validate these conditions, the problem statement assumes the inputs are valid. Therefore, this assumption holds true under the given constraints.

2. **Merging Lists**: The program correctly merges the two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) into a new sorted list called `merged_list`. This step ensures that the final list is sorted, which is necessary for finding the median.

3. **Finding Median**: 
   - If the size of the merged list is even, the program correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the size of the merged list is odd, the program correctly calculates the median as the middle element.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles both even and odd sizes of the merged list without any issues, ensuring that it can correctly compute the median in all cases.

Given these points, the program always does what the problem description asks for, and there are no cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Hence, the correctness is True.
