Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Specifically, the issue lies in the line where the `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`. This is incorrect because the index should be `size // 2` to correctly point to the middle element(s) of the merged list. Since the lists are of the same size, the correct middle index for an even-sized merged list would be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, and for an odd-sized merged list, it would simply be `size // 2`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This corrected version ensures that the median is calculated correctly for both even and odd sizes of the merged list.
