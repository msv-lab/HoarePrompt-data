Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program assumes that the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd when calculating the median. However, the problem description states that the two lists are of the same size, meaning their combined length is always even. Therefore, the calculation of the middle index should be adjusted to handle this even length correctly.

For instance, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, both of size 2, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The middle indices would be 1 and 2, and the median should be the average of the elements at these indices, which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

The current implementation incorrectly uses `size - 1` as the middle index, which leads to incorrect results. To fix this, the middle index should be calculated as `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2 - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This correction ensures that the program works correctly for all inputs where the two lists are of the same size.
