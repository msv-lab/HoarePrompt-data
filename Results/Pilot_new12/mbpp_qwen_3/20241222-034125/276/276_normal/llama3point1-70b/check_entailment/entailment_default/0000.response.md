Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists into a single sorted list and then calculates the median based on the size of the merged list. If the size is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if the size is odd, it returns the middle element. The code handles both even and odd sizes correctly, and no missing functionality or edge cases are noted in the problem description or the output hints. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
