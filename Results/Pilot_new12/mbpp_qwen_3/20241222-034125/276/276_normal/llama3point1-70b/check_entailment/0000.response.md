Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the combined length of `list1` and `list2` is odd. The problem description specifies finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but the program attempts to find the median by sorting the merged list and then calculating the median based on the size being even or odd. However, if the combined length of the two lists is odd, the calculation of the median will be incorrect.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `list1 = [1, 3, 5]`
- `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`

The combined list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The median should be the average of the third and fourth elements, which are `3` and `4`, respectively. Therefore, the correct median is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.

However, the program will calculate the median using the middle element only, which in this case would be `4` (since the middle index is `2` and the size is even), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should handle the case when the combined length is odd by averaging the middle element and the next element in the sorted merged list.
