Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `list1` or `list2` is empty, the function should handle this scenario, although the current code assumes they are both non-empty and of the same size. This could lead to an error if these conditions are not met. To handle this, an additional check could be added to ensure both lists are non-empty and of the same size before proceeding with the merging and median calculation.
