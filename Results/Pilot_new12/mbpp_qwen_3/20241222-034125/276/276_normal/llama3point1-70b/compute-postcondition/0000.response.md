The code concatenates `list1` and `list2` into a new list and then sorts this concatenated list. The original lists `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged. The merged list is sorted, so the `merged_list` will contain all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order. The size of `merged_list` will be twice the size of `list1` (or `list2`). The states of `list1` and `list2` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size); `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order.**
