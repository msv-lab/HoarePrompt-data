The code assigns the value of `merged_list[middle_index]` to the variable `median`. Given that `middle_index` is `size - 1` and the size of `list1` and `list2` is odd, `size - 1` is an even number. The `merged_list` contains all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order, and since the size is odd, the middle index of the combined list will point to the exact middle element of this merged list. 

Thus, `median` will be assigned the value of the element at the position `size - 1` in `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `median` is `merged_list[size - 1]`**
