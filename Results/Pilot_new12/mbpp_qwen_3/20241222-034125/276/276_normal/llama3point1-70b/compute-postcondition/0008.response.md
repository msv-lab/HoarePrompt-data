The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size, and `size` is a positive integer. After merging `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted list, if the total size is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total size is odd, it returns the middle element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, and return the median of the merged and sorted list.
