#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of `merged_list[size / 2 - 1]` and `merged_list[size / 2]`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is the average of merged_list[size / 2 - 1] and merged_list[size / 2] if size is even, or merged_list[size - 1] if size is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.
