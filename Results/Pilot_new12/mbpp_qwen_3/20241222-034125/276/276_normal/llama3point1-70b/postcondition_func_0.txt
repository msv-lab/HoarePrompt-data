The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, merges them into a single sorted list called `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (i.e., `size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element. The function correctly handles the case where `size` is even and odd, and no missing functionality is noted.
