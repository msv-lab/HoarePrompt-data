The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. After concatenating and sorting these lists, the function returns the median of the resulting list. If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It returns the median of the concatenated and sorted list, which is the average of the two middle elements if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle element if the length is odd.**
