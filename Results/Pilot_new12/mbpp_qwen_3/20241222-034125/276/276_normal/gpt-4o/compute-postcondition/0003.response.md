The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements, which are `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`. Since `mid` is equal to `n`, the two middle elements are `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`. The result is stored in the variable `median`. The calculation does not affect the lengths or contents of `list1`, `list2`, or `merged_list`, nor does it change the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n, `median` is (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2**
