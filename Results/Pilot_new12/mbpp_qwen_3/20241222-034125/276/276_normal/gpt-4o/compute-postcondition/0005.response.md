The code `median = merged_list[mid]` assigns the middle element of `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Given that `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with a length of 2n and the length is odd, the middle index `mid` is `n`. The value of `median` is the element at index `n` in `merged_list`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n, the length of `merged_list` is odd, and `median` is the element at index n in `merged_list`.**
