`merged_list` is assigned the value of a sorted concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, their concatenation and subsequent sorting will result in a new sorted list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`)**
