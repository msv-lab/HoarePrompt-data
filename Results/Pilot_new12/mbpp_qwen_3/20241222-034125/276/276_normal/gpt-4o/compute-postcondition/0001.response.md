The code `mid = len(merged_list) // 2` calculates the midpoint index of `merged_list` and assigns it to `mid`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length `2n`, the value of `mid` will be `n` (as `len(merged_list) // 2` is equivalent to `2n // 2` which is `n`).

The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n**
