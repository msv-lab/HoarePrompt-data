Postcondition: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n, and `median` is the median of the concatenated and sorted list, which is calculated as follows: if the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`); if the length of `merged_list` is odd, `median` is the middle element (`merged_list[n]`).**
