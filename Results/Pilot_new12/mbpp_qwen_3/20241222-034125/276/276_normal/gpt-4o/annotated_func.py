#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same length n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n, and `median` is the median of the concatenated and sorted list, which is calculated as follows: if the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`); if the length of `merged_list` is odd, `median` is the middle element (`merged_list[n]`).
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the concatenated and sorted list 'merged_list', which is the average of the two middle elements merged_list[mid - 1] and merged_list[mid] if the length of merged_list is even, or the middle element merged_list[mid] if the length of merged_list is odd
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It concatenates these two lists, sorts the resulting list, and then calculates and returns the median of the sorted list. If the length of the concatenated list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function ensures that `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged throughout its execution. An edge case to consider is when `n` is 1, in which case the median is simply the single element in either `list1` or `list2`. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
