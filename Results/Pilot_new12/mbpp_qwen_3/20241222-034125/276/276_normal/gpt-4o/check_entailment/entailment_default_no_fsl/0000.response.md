Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function `func_1` concatenates the two input lists, sorts the combined list, and then calculates the median based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd. The code handles all the mentioned cases, including the edge case where `n` is 1. Since the input lists are guaranteed to be valid and non-empty, and the code correctly processes the given assertions, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
