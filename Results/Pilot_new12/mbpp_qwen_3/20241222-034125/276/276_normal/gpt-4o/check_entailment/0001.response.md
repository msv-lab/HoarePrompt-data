Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Since the problem description specifies that the lists are already sorted and of the same size, the approach taken by the function is valid and will work for any such inputs. The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
