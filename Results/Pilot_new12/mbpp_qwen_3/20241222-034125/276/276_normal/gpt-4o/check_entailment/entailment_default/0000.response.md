Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists of the same size and finds their median by merging them into a single sorted list and then calculating the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. The examples given in the problem description and the output hints align with the code's implementation. The function handles the case where the lists have a size of 1 and ensures that the median is calculated correctly for both odd and even lengths of the combined list. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
