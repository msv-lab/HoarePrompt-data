Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotations support this correctness by detailing the state of the program at different points and confirming that the function works as intended. The test cases provided in the assertions also confirm the function's validity for the given examples. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
