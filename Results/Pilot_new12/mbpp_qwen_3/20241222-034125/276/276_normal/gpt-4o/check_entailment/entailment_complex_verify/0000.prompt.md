You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program works correctly for the given test cases, but it has a critical flaw in handling the general case of merging and finding the median. Specifically, the program merges the two lists and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. However, this approach assumes that both input lists are already sorted and of the same size, which is correct according to the problem description. 

The issue arises when considering edge cases or additional test cases that are not covered by the assertions. For example, consider the following scenario:

- `list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
- `list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

In this case, the median would be the average of the 5th and 6th elements in the merged and sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which is `(5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5`. However, the provided program will merge the lists and then find the median as before, resulting in `median = 6` because the length is even and `mid = 5`.

To correctly handle this, the program should ensure that it properly handles the merging and finding the median without relying solely on the assumption that the lists are already merged. However, since the problem specifically states that the lists are sorted and of the same size, and the provided implementation works for the given examples, the issue lies more in the scope of the problem rather than the code itself. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is considered incorrect due to the potential oversight in handling edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same length n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `list1` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with length n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with length 2n (concatenation and sorting of `list1` + `list2`), `mid` is n, and `median` is the median of the concatenated and sorted list, which is calculated as follows: if the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`); if the length of `merged_list` is odd, `median` is the middle element (`merged_list[n]`).
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the concatenated and sorted list 'merged_list', which is the average of the two middle elements merged_list[mid - 1] and merged_list[mid] if the length of merged_list is even, or the middle element merged_list[mid] if the length of merged_list is odd
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It concatenates these two lists, sorts the resulting list, and then calculates and returns the median of the sorted list. If the length of the concatenated list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function ensures that `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged throughout its execution. An edge case to consider is when `n` is 1, in which case the median is simply the single element in either `list1` or `list2`. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
