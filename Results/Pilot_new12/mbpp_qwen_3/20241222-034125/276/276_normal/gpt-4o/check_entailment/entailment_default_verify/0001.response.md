Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The output hints confirm that the function accepts two sorted lists, concatenates them, sorts the result, and then calculates the median based on the length of the merged list. The test cases provided also validate that the function works as expected. The edge case where `n` is 1 is handled correctly, as the median would be the single element. There is no indication from the output hints that there are any issues with the program's behavior or correctness. Thus, the original assessment remains valid.
