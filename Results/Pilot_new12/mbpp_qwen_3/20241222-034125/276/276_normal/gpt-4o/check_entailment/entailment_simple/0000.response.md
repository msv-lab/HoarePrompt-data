Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the requirement to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description does not specify any validation for the inputs (i.e., checking if the lists are sorted or if they have the same length). Since the provided assertions pass without any errors, we can infer that the program handles valid inputs correctly. 

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function concatenates the two lists and sorts them. This is necessary because finding the median requires the combined list to be in order.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - If the total number of elements in the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.

4. **Correct Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions test different scenarios (even and odd number of elements) and the results match the expected medians.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and the provided tests pass, the program is correct.
