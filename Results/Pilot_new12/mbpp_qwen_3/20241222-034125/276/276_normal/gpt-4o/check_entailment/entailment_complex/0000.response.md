Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. However, `n` is not used within the function and can be removed for simplicity. The function directly uses `list1` and `list2`.
   - It concatenates `list1` and `list2` into a new list `merged_list` and sorts it.
   - It then calculates the median of the sorted list `merged_list`:
     - If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
     - If the length of `merged_list` is odd, the median is the middle element.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the lists are of equal size (even or odd length) and provides the appropriate median value.
   - For the edge case where `n` is 1 (i.e., each list contains only one element), the function correctly computes the median as the single element from either list.

4. **Input Validity**:
   - As per the problem statement, we assume the input will be valid (both lists are sorted and of the same size). Therefore, there is no need for additional validation checks in the function.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, thereby meeting the problem description.
