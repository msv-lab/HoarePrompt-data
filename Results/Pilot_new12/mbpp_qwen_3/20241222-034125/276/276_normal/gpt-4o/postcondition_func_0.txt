The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of integers with the same length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It concatenates these two lists, sorts the resulting list, and then calculates and returns the median of the sorted list. If the length of the concatenated list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function ensures that `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged throughout its execution. An edge case to consider is when `n` is 1, in which case the median is simply the single element in either `list1` or `list2`. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
