Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program implements the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The program iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their digit length until the condition is met. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` indeed accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is at least `n`. Given the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness.
