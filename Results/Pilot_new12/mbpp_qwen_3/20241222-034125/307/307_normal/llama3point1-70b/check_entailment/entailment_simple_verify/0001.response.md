Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotated version clearly shows that the loop continues to iterate, incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. Once this condition is met, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is indeed the smallest index such that the triangular number has `n` digits. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description and operates as intended.
