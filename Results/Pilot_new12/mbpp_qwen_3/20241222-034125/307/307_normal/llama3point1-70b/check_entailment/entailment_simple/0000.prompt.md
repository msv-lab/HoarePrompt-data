You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` is a positive integer
    #- `idx` is 1
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #while True:
    #    triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
    #    if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
    #        return idx
    #    idx += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` starts at 1.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(1)) >= n`. This will be false unless `n == 1`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 2.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` is now 2.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(3)) >= n`. This will be false unless `n <= 1`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 3.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` is now 3.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(6)) >= n`. This will be true if `n <= 1` or `n <= 2`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 4.
    #
    #From these iterations, we observe that:
    #- The loop continues incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- Once this condition is met, the function returns the value of `idx`.
    #
    #### General Pattern:
    #- For a given `n`, the loop will continue to increment `idx` until the length of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- The smallest `idx` such that `len(str(idx * (idx + 1) // 2)) >= n` will be returned.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- The loop will terminate when the length of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- At this point, `idx` will be the smallest integer such that `len(str(idx * (idx + 1) // 2)) >= n`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
    #
    #**Output State: `'idx' is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of 'idx * (idx + 1) // 2' is at least 'n'**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
