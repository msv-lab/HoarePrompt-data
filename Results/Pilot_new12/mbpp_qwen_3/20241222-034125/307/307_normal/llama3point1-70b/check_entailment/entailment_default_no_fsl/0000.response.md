Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It iterates through increasing values of `idx`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks if its string length is at least `n`. Once the condition is met, it returns the value of `idx`. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints. There are no edge cases or inputs mentioned in the hints or problem description that this code does not handle correctly.
