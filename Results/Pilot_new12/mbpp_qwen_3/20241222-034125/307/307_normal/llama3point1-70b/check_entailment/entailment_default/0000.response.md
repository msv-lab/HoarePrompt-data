Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It aims to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and returns the corresponding index `idx`. The code uses a simple iterative approach to increment `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is at least `n`. The output hints confirm that the function returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the code fails to meet the requirements based on the given problem description and hints.
