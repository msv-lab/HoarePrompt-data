Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `idx` to 1, which represents the index of the triangular numbers being checked.
2. **Loop Condition**: The `while True` loop continues until the length of the string representation of the current triangular number (`triangular_num`) is at least `n`.
3. **Triangular Number Calculation**: Inside the loop, the function calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
4. **Condition Check**: The function checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. **Return Statement**: If the condition is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is the smallest index such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`.

Given the problem description, the function needs to find the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits and return its index. The function correctly performs this task by incrementally checking each triangular number until it finds one that meets the digit requirement.

Since the function adheres to the problem description for any valid positive integer `n`, the correctness of the program is **True**.
