Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotated version supports this by detailing the step-by-step execution of the loop and explaining how `idx` is incremented until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. The function returns the smallest `idx` satisfying this condition, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
