Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function iteratively checks each triangular number until it finds the smallest one with at least `n` digits. The triangular number is calculated using the correct formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and the condition to check the number of digits is implemented accurately. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct index `idx` for a given positive integer `n`. Since the function works as intended and the original assessment accurately reflects this, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
