You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, i.e., \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The program iterates over increasing values of `k` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. This approach ensures that the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is found, and the index of this number is returned. Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for any valid input `n`, it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` is a positive integer
    #- `idx` is 1
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #while True:
    #    triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
    #    if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
    #        return idx
    #    idx += 1
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` starts at 1.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(1)) >= n`. This will be false unless `n == 1`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 2.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` is now 2.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(3)) >= n`. This will be false unless `n <= 1`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 3.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration:**
    #   - `idx` is now 3.
    #   - Calculate `triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`.
    #   - Check if `len(str(6)) >= n`. This will be true if `n <= 1` or `n <= 2`.
    #   - Increment `idx` to 4.
    #
    #From these iterations, we observe that:
    #- The loop continues incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- Once this condition is met, the function returns the value of `idx`.
    #
    #### General Pattern:
    #- For a given `n`, the loop will continue to increment `idx` until the length of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- The smallest `idx` such that `len(str(idx * (idx + 1) // 2)) >= n` will be returned.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- The loop will terminate when the length of `triangular_num` is at least `n`.
    #- At this point, `idx` will be the smallest integer such that `len(str(idx * (idx + 1) // 2)) >= n`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
    #
    #**Output State: `'idx' is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of 'idx * (idx + 1) // 2' is at least 'n'**
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is at least `n`. The function ensures that `idx` is incremented until the condition is met and then returns the value of `idx`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
