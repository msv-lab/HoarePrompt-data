Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is assumed to be a positive integer.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The variable `idx` is initialized to 1.
   - Inside the `while True` loop, the program calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx} \times (\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \).
   - It then checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is at least `n` using `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the function immediately returns `idx`.

3. **Incrementing `idx`**:
   - If the condition is not met, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when `triangular_num` has at least `n` digits.
   - At this point, `idx` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the corresponding triangular number is at least `n`.

5. **General Pattern**:
   - The program ensures that the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is found by iteratively increasing `idx` and checking the condition.
   - Once the condition is met, the function correctly returns the value of `idx`.

Since the program follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately, it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Therefore, the program is correct.
