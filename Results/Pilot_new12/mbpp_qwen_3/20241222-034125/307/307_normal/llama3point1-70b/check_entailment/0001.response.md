Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, i.e., \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The program iterates over increasing values of `k` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. This approach ensures that the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is found, and the index of this number is returned. Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for any valid input `n`, it is correct.
