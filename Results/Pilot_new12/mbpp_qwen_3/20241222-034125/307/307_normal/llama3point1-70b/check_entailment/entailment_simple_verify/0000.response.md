Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations confirm that the function correctly iterates through triangular numbers and increments `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`. Once this condition is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is indeed the smallest index for which the triangular number has at least `n` digits. 

The original assessment is accurate because the provided code and the annotations align with the problem description, ensuring that the function behaves as intended without any logical errors or incorrect assumptions about the input or the algorithm. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
