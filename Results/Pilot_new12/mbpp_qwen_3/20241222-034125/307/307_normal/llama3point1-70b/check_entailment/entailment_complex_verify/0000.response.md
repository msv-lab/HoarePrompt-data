Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through the triangular numbers, incrementing the index until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has at least `n` digits. The loop terminates when this condition is met, and the function returns the current value of `idx`. The annotations support this behavior and confirm that the function meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
