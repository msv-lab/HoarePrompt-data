Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function uses a while loop to incrementally check each triangular number until it finds one with at least `n` digits. The formula for the triangular number is correctly applied, and the condition to check the number of digits is also correct. Since the function iterates through the triangular numbers and returns the correct index when the condition is met, it should work for all valid inputs `n`. Therefore, no counterexample was found, and the program is correct.
