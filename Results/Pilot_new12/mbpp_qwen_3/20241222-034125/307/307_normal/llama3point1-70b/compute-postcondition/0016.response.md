`idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 3, so after incrementing, `idx` becomes 4. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is "6") is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is not necessarily false but was previously checked and did not cause a return. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 4, and `triangular_num` is 6.**
