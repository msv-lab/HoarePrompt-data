`idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 2, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 3. The conditions for returning `idx` are not met because the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is 3) is not greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, no return occurs, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
