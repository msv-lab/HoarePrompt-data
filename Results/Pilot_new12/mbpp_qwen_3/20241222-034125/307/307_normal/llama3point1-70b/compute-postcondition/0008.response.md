`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, the value of `triangular_num` becomes `2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 * 3 // 2` resulting in `3`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
