The code assigns the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` to `triangular_num`. Given that `idx` is 1, the calculation becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2` and further simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `triangular_num` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
