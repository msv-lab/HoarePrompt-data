According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute as long as we allow it to. Since no conditions are given to terminate this loop, the only thing we need to adjust is to ensure that the loop can continue to execute, which is inherently true in a `while True` loop.

However, we should still ensure that the program state is such that the loop's continuation makes sense in the context of the problem. The current state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `idx` is 2
- `triangular_num` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`

For the loop to continue executing, the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` must remain less than `n`. Since no changes are made to `n` or `triangular_num` within the loop body (as it is omitted), the only thing that could change is `triangular_num`, but since we are only asked to prepare for the next iteration, we don't need to change anything related to `triangular_num` explicitly.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments beyond what is already given.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
