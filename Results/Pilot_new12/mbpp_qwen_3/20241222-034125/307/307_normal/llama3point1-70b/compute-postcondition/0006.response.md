The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that the initial state is `idx` is 1, after the code execution, `idx` will be updated to 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `triangular_num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
