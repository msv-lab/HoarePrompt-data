According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as it is entered. Since it is a `while True` loop, no condition needs to be met for the loop to execute one more time. The current state of `n` being a positive integer and `idx` being 1 does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 1**
