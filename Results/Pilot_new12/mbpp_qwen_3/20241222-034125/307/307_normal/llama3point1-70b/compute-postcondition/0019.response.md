Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is at least `n`. The function ensures that `idx` is incremented until the condition is met and then returns the value of `idx`.**

This means that the function will:

1. Initialize `idx` to 1.
2. Continuously calculate the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. Check if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`.
4. If the condition is not met, increment `idx` and repeat the process.
5. Once the condition is met, return the current value of `idx`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality to consider:

- If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 since the first triangular number (1) has a string length of 1.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function will continue to increment `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number meets the condition.
- The function will not return any other values besides 1, 2, or 3 as explicitly stated in the return postconditions. This implies that for `n > 3`, the function will always return 3 because the smallest `idx` that satisfies the condition will be at least 3.

In summary, the function determines the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the corresponding triangular number is at least `n`, and it returns this value.
