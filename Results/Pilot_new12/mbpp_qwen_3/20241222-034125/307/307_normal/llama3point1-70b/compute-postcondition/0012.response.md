Step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop in question is `while True:`. This means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as no break statement is encountered within the loop.

2. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

3. No state modifications are necessary for this loop to execute one more time because the condition `while True` is always true.

Therefore, the program state does not need to be modified for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
