The code updates the value of `triangular_num` to be `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 3, the new value of `triangular_num` is calculated as `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which equals 6. The values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
