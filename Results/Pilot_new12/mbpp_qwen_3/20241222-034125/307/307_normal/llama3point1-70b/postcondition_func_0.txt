The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is at least `n`. The function ensures that `idx` is incremented until the condition is met and then returns the value of `idx`.
