The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is equal to `n`. If no such `k` exists within a reasonable range (due to the nature of triangular numbers growing rapidly), the function may not terminate or return a value, depending on the input `n`.

The function iterates through positive integers starting from 1, calculating the triangular number for each `k` using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`. If it finds such a `k`, it returns it immediately. If the loop exits without finding a suitable `k`, the function may hang indefinitely or return an unexpected value, depending on the specific implementation details and input constraints.
