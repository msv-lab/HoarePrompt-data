Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. Hereâ€™s the breakdown based on the annotations and the problem description:

1. **Function Inputs**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is assumed to be a positive integer (as stated in the annotation).
2. **Loop Execution**: The function initializes `k` to 1 and enters a `while True` loop. Within this loop, it calculates the triangular number using the formula \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The loop continues incrementing `k` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`.
3. **Correctness of Assertions**:
   - For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to `k = 4` (since \( \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 10 \)). The assertion `assert func_1(2) == 4` is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which corresponds to `k = 14` (since \( \frac{14 \times 15}{2} = 105 \)). The assertion `assert func_1(3) == 14` is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which corresponds to `k = 45` (since \( \frac{45 \times 46}{2} = 1035 \)). The assertion `assert func_1(4) == 45` is correct.

Since the function handles the problem as described and the provided assertions are satisfied, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
