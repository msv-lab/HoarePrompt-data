Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to work correctly for the given test cases, but there might be edge cases or issues that were not covered. Specifically, the program returns the value of `k` when the triangular number has exactly `n` digits, which might not always be the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

To illustrate, let's consider the case when `n = 1`. The smallest triangular number with 1 digit is 1, which is achieved when `k = 1`. However, the program will increment `k` until it finds a number with `n` digits, which means it will return `k = 2` for `n = 1` because the next triangular number, 3, has 1 digit. This is incorrect because 1 is the smallest triangular number with 1 digit.

Thus, the program fails to handle the case where `n = 1`, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
