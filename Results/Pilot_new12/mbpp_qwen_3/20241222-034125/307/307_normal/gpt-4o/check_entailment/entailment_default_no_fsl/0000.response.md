Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function `func_1(n)` iterates through positive integers `k` starting from 1, calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number equals `n`. If it finds such a `k`, it returns it immediately. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases (n=2, n=3, n=4). Given the nature of the triangular number sequence and the provided examples, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, assuming valid input.
