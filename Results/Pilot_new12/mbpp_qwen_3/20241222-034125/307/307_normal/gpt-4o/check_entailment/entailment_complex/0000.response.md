Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function `func_1(n)` is required to find the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits and return the corresponding `k`.

2. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has `n` digits.
   - A triangular number is calculated using the formula \( \text{triangular\_number} = k \times (k + 1) // 2 \).
   - The function checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`.
   - As soon as it finds such a `k`, it returns `k`.

3. **Behavior Verification**:
   - The assertions provided in the code (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) verify that the function works correctly for the specified test cases.
   - The function correctly handles the condition where the length of the triangular number matches `n`.

4. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - The problem description assumes valid inputs, meaning `n` is a positive integer.
   - The function correctly iterates over positive integers, ensuring that it will eventually find a `k` that satisfies the condition for sufficiently large `n`.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
