Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has `n` digits.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
3. **Loop and Triangular Number Calculation**:
   - The variable `k` starts at 1 and is incremented in each iteration.
   - For each value of `k`, the triangular number is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - The function checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`.
   - Once the condition is met, the function returns `k`.

The provided assertions check the function with different values of `n`:
- `func_1(2)` should return 4 because the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to `k = 14`.
- `func_1(3)` should return 14 because the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 120, which corresponds to `k = 15`.
- `func_1(4)` should return 45 because the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which corresponds to `k = 45`.

The program iterates until it finds the smallest `k` such that the triangular number has `n` digits, which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
