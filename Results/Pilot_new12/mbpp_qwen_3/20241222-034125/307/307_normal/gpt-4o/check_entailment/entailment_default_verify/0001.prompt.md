You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates over possible values of `k` until it finds a triangular number whose string length equals `n`. The formula used to calculate the triangular number \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) is correct, and the condition `if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:` ensures that the function returns the correct index `k` when the triangular number has `n` digits.

Given the assertions:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to `k = 14` (since \( \frac{14 \times 15}{2} = 105 \)).
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, which corresponds to `k = 45` (since \( \frac{45 \times 46}{2} = 1035 \)).
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which corresponds to `k = 141` (since \( \frac{141 \times 142}{2} = 10011 \)).

The function passes these test cases and seems to handle the problem as described without any apparent issues. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is equal to `n`. If no such `k` exists within a reasonable range (due to the nature of triangular numbers growing rapidly), the function may not terminate or return a value, depending on the input `n`.

The function iterates through positive integers starting from 1, calculating the triangular number for each `k` using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`. If it finds such a `k`, it returns it immediately. If the loop exits without finding a suitable `k`, the function may hang indefinitely or return an unexpected value, depending on the specific implementation details and input constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
