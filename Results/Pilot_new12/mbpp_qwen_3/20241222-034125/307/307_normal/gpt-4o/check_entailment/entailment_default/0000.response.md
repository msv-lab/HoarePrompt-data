Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It starts with `k = 1` and iteratively increases `k` until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length equal to `n`. The triangular number is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Once the condition is met, the function returns `k`.

The problem description asks for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, and the program does exactly that by incrementing `k` until the condition is satisfied. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning the correct `k` for the given `n` in the provided examples. There are no edge cases or examples in the hints that indicate the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
