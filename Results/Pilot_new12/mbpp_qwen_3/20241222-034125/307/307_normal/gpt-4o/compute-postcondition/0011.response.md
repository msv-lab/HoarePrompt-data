The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. The condition for returning 2 based on the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` being equal to `n` is not affected by this change, as the code snippet only modifies `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.**
