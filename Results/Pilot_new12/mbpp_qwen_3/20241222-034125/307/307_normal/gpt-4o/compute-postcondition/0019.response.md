Functionality: **The function `func_1(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is equal to `n`. If no such `k` exists within a reasonable range (due to the nature of triangular numbers growing rapidly), the function may not terminate or return a value, depending on the input `n`.

The function iterates through positive integers starting from 1, calculating the triangular number for each `k` using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`. If it finds such a `k`, it returns it immediately. If the loop exits without finding a suitable `k`, the function may hang indefinitely or return an unexpected value, depending on the specific implementation details and input constraints.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is very large, the function may not find a suitable `k` within a reasonable range and could potentially run indefinitely.
- If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 because the first triangular number (1) has a length of 1.
- If `n` is 2, the function will return 2 because the second triangular number (3) has a length of 2.
- If `n` is 3, the function will return 8 because the eighth triangular number (36) has a length of 2, and the ninth triangular number (45) has a length of 2, but the tenth triangular number (55) has a length of 2, and so on until the eighth triangular number, which has a length of 3.

**Return Postconditions:**
- Case_1: The program returns 1, indicating that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k=1` is equal to `n`.
- Case_2: The program returns 2, indicating that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k=2` is equal to `n`.
- Case_3: The program returns 3, indicating that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k=8` is equal to `n`.

The function does not explicitly handle cases where no such `k` exists within a reasonable range, so it may return an unexpected value or hang indefinitely in such cases.**
