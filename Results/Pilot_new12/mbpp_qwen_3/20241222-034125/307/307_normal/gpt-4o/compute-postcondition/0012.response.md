According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop that determine whether it should continue, the loop will definitely execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 3
- `triangular_number` is 3

Since the loop is a `while True` loop, no adjustments are needed to any of the variables for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to run indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**
