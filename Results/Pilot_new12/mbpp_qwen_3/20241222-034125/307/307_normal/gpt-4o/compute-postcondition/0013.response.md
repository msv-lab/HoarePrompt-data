The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state where `k` is 3, the new value of `triangular_number` is calculated as `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which equals 6. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 6**
