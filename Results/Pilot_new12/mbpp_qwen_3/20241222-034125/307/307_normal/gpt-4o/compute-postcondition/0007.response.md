According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as no break statement is encountered. However, the loop will only proceed to the next iteration if the condition specified in the while statement is met. In this case, the condition is not explicitly given, but we need to ensure that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` becomes equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must become equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must be equal to `n`**
