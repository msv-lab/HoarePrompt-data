Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly stopped, the loop will always execute at least one time regardless of the initial values of the variables `n` and `k`. The condition `while True` ensures that the loop continues running until some external condition stops it.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 1

The loop will start executing immediately because the condition `while True` is always true. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1**
