The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state where `k` is 2, the new value of `triangular_number` will be calculated as follows: `2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. The length of the string representation of the new `triangular_number` (which is 3) must still be equal to `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`.**
