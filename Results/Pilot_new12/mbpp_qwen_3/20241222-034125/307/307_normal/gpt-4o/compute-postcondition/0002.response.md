The code assigns the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2` to the variable `triangular_number`. Given that `k` is 1, the value of `triangular_number` is calculated as `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2` or `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
