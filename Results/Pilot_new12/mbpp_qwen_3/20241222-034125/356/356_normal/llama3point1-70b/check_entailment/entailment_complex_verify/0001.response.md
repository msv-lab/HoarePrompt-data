Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` removes all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a string `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. Since the problem description asks for a function to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the provided function fulfills this requirement without any edge cases needing special handling (as per the annotations), the original assessment is accurate.
