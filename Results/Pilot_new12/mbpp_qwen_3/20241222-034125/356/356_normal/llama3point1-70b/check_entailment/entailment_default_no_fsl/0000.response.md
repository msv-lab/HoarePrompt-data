Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. Since the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the function does exactly that, the function works correctly for every potential case. There are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling, such as empty strings or strings without spaces, and the function does not modify the original string, creating a new string without any spaces as required. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
