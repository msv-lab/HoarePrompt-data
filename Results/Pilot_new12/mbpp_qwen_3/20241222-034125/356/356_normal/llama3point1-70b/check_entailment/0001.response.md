Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. This method will correctly handle all potential cases, including strings with multiple spaces, leading and trailing spaces, and different types of whitespace characters (like tabs and newlines). Since the function correctly removes all spaces as per the problem description and there are no identified edge cases where it fails, the program is correct.
