Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` and returns it with all whitespaces removed. The `replace` method used in the function effectively removes all occurrences of whitespace characters, which aligns with the problem description of removing all whitespaces from a string. Since the function behaves as intended and the annotations support this behavior, the program is correct.
