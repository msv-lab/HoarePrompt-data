Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a string `input_str`, returns a new string with all spaces removed, and does not modify the original string. Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement and handles all cases appropriately without any identified edge cases, the original assessment is accurate.
