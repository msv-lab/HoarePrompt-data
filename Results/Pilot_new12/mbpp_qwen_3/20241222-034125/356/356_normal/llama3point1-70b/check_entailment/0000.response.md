Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. This method will replace all occurrences of the specified whitespace character with an empty string, effectively removing them. Since the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the function accomplishes this task accurately for any input string, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as it handles all possible strings appropriately.
