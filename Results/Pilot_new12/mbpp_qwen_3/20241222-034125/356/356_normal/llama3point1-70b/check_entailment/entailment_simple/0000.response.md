Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `input_str` as input and returns the string with all whitespaces removed. The function uses the `replace` method of strings in Python, which replaces all occurrences of the specified substring (in this case, a single space ' ') with another substring (an empty string ''). 

Given the problem description to write a function that removes all whitespaces from a string, the provided program meets this requirement perfectly. It handles the task correctly for every possible input string, as the `replace` method will remove all instances of spaces, including multiple consecutive spaces, ensuring that no whitespace remains in the returned string. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
