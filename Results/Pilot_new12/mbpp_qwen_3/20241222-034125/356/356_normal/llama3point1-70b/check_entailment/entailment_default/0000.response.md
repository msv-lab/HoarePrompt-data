Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` removes all whitespaces from a given string using the `replace` method. The function takes a single string `input_str` as input and returns a new string with all spaces removed. Given the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string, the provided code correctly implements this functionality. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new string without any spaces. Since there are no edge cases or specific examples mentioned that the code does not handle, and the code works for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
