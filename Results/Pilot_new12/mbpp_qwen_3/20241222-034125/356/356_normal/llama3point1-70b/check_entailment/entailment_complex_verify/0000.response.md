Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a string `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling, such as empty strings or strings without spaces. The function does not modify the original string; instead, it creates and returns a new string without any spaces. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
