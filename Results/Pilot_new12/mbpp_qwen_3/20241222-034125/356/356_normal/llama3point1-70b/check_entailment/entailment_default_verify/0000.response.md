Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts a string and returns a new string with all spaces removed, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all possible strings appropriately, including edge cases such as empty strings or strings without spaces, as indicated by the absence of any special handling in the code. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
