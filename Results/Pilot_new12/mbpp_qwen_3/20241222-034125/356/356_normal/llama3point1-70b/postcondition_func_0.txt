The function `func_1` accepts a string `input_str` as a parameter and returns a new string with all spaces removed. This transformation is achieved by using the `replace` method of the string object. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, such as empty strings or strings without spaces. The function does not modify the original string; instead, it creates and returns a new string without any spaces.
