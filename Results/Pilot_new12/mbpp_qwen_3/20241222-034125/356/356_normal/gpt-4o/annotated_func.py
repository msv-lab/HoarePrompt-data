#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string `s` with all spaces removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string with all spaces removed. This is achieved using the `replace` method, which removes all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space) from the original string. The function does not modify the original string; instead, it creates and returns a new string with the spaces removed. The function handles the edge case where the input string might be empty or already contain no spaces. In such cases, the function simply returns the original string unchanged.
