Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the input string, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function handles various types of whitespace and returns the expected results for the provided test cases. Since the function behaves as intended and the original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the implementation, there is no need to change the original assessment.
