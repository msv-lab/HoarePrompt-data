Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including multiple spaces between words and leading/trailing spaces, and the function passes all these tests. The output hints confirm that the function does not modify the original string but returns a new string with spaces removed. Given that the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the function satisfies this requirement without any apparent issues, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
