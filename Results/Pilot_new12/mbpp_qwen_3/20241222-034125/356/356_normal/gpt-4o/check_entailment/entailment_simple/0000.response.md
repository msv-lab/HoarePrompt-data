Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of a space (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing all whitespaces. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including strings with leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive whitespaces. Therefore, the program is correct and always meets the requirement specified in the problem description.
