Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version clarifies that the function uses the `replace` method to achieve this, and it correctly handles various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive spaces and leading/trailing spaces. There are no contradictions or issues identified in the annotated version that would necessitate a change to the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
