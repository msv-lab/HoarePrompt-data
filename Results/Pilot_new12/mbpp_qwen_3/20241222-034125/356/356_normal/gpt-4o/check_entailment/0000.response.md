Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespaces from the input string. This approach correctly removes all occurrences of spaces, tabs, and other whitespace characters. Given the examples provided:

1. `func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'`
2. `func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'`
3. `func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'`
4. `func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'`

The function works as expected in all cases. Since the function correctly handles various types of whitespace and produces the correct output for the given examples, we can conclude that the program is correct.
