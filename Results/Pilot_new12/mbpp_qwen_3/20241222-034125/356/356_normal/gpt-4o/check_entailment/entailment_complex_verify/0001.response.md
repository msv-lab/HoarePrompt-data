Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The provided assertions cover various scenarios including multiple spaces between words and leading/trailing spaces. The annotated version clearly explains that the function accepts a string and returns a new string with all spaces removed without modifying the original string. The function handles edge cases where the input string might be empty or already contain no spaces, returning the original string unchanged. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
