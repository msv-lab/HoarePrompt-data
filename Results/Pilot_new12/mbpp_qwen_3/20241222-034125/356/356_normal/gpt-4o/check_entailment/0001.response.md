Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The test cases provided cover various scenarios including multiple spaces between words and leading/trailing spaces. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the `replace` method will handle all types of whitespace characters (not just single spaces), we can conclude that the function works correctly for all potential cases related to removing whitespaces from a string.
