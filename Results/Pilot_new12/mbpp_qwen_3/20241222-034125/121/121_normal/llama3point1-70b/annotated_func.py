#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns `False`. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n` to check for divisibility. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. The function does not perform any actions beyond these checks and returns either `True` or `False` based on the results of the prime number test.

    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is the last value that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]` and `func_1(num)` evaluates to True; if no such `num` is found, `num` remains its original value of 7.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. It returns one of three values: 7, 8, or 9. 

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function initializes `count` to 1 and sets `num` to 7. It then enters a loop where it checks if `num` satisfies certain conditions using `func_1(num)`. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `func_1(num)` is True, it increments `count`. When `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`.
- If no such `num` is found within the loop, the function will return 7.

The function ensures that if `n` is 1, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it searches for a suitable `num` that meets the specified conditions, and if such a `num` is found, it returns that value; otherwise, it falls back to returning 7.
