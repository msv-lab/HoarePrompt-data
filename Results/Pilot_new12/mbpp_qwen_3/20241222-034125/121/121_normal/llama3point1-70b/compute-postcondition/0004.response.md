`count` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1 is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1**
