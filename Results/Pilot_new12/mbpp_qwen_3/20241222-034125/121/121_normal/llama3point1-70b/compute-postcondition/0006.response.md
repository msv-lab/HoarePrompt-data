According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute because it is an infinite loop. Since there are no conditions to check within the loop, no adjustments to the states are necessary to make the loop execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**
