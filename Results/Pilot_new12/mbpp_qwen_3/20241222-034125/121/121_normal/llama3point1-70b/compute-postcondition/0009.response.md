The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True; the current value of `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5**
