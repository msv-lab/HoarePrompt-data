The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is 7, so after the increment, `num` becomes 8. The other variables (`n`, `count`, and `func_1(num)`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 (if `num % 6` is 1 or 5) or 1 (if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5); `num` is 8; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5; if `func_1(num)` evaluates to False, the values of `n`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged.**
