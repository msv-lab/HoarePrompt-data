Let's break down the given conditions and the `while True` loop to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- `count` is either 2 (if `num % 6` is 1 or 5) or 1 (if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5).
- `num` is 8.
- The function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.
- If `func_1(num)` evaluates to False, the values of `n`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is `while True`, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as no condition outside the loop body breaks it.
2. **Internal Logic**:
   - If `func_1(num)` returns `True`, the loop body updates `count` and checks if `count` equals `n`.
   - If `count` is not equal to `n`, the loop continues.
   - If `func_1(num)` returns `False`, the values of `n`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless there is an external condition (not specified here) that breaks the loop.
- Given that `func_1(num)` evaluates to `True` in this scenario, `count` will be updated, and the loop will continue as long as `count` is not equal to `n`.

Since the loop will always continue due to `while True`, no specific adjustments are needed to ensure it executes one more time. However, to reflect the current state before the next iteration, we should ensure that all relevant states are correctly represented.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 (if `num % 6` is 1 or 5) or 1 (if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5); `num` is 8; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to execute as it is `while True`.
