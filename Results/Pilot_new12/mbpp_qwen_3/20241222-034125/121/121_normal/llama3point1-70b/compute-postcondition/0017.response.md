`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 2 (if `num % 6` is 1 or 5) or 1 (if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5). Since `num` is 8, `num % 6` is 2, which means `count` is initially 1. After incrementing `count` by 1, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.**
