Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 (if `num % 6` is 1 or 5) or 1 (if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5); `num` is 7; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5; if `func_1(num)` evaluates to False, the values of `n`, `count`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
