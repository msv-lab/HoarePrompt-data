Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 1; `num` is 8; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns 8. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the function returns None if `count` does not equal `n`.***
