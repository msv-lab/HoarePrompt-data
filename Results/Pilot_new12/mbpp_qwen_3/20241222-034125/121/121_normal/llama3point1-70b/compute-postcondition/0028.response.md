Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 3; `num` is 9. If `num % 6` is 1 or 5 and `count` equals `n`, the function returns 9. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged (i.e., `count` is either 2 or 3, and no other changes occur).***
