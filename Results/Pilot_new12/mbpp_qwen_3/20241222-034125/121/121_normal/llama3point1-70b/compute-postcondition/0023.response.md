To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while True` loop continues.

The given conditions are:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- `count` is either 2 or 1.
- `num` is 9.
- `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.
- If `count` equals `n`, the function returns 8. Otherwise, the function returns None if `count` does not equal `n`.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit condition that causes it to break. The loop will continue as long as no external condition breaks it, meaning we need to consider the internal logic of the loop body, which is not provided.

Given the function behavior:
- If `count` equals `n`, the function returns 8 (which likely breaks the loop).
- If `count` does not equal `n`, the function returns None (which does not break the loop).

Since `count` is either 2 or 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` will not equal `n` in this context. Therefore, the function will return None, allowing the loop to continue.

For the loop to continue executing, we don't need to adjust any specific states because the loop will keep running as long as the function does not return 8, which only happens when `count` equals `n`.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration does not need any modifications for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 1; `num` is 9; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.**
