`num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 8, so after the increment, `num` becomes 9. The other variables (`n`, `count`, and the function `func_1`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 1; `num` is 9; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns 8. Otherwise, the function returns None if `count` does not equal `n`.**
