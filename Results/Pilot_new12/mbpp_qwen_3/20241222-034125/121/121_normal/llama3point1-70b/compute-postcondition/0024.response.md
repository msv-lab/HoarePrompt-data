`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 2 or 1, so after incrementing by 1, `count` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or 2 if it was initially 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num)`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2 or 3; `num` is 9; `func_1(num)` evaluates to True and `count` is not equal to `n` if `num % 6` is 1 or 5.**
