`num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is 9, so after the increment, `num` becomes 10. The conditions for returning 9 based on the modulo operation and the value of `count` do not apply here since the code simply increments `num`. The states of `n` and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 3; `num` is 10.**
