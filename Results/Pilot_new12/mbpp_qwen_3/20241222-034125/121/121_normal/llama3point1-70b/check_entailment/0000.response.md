Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, it has a logical error in the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]:`. This condition checks if a number is of the form 6k ± 1, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a number to be prime. Additionally, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented for checking primality, but it is not used to filter out non-prime numbers in the loop where `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is checked. 

To illustrate, consider the following example:

For `n = 2`, the program should return the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the sequence, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 41, 239, etc. The program incorrectly includes all numbers of the form 6k ± 1, including non-prime numbers like 41 (which is prime), 25 (which is not prime), and so on. Therefore, the program will not correctly identify the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

A correct implementation would ensure that only prime numbers of the form 6k ± 1 are considered.
