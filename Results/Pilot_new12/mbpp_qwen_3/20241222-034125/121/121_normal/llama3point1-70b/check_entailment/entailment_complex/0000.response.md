Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. According to the problem description, the function should find the nth prime number that fits specific criteria (primality, and being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6). However, the code in `func_2` contains a critical flaw:

- The function returns 7 if `n` is 1, which is correct for the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime.
- For `n > 1`, the function starts checking from 7 and increments by 1 each time, checking only numbers congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6 for primality using `func_1`.

The issue arises because the function will never find any primes other than 7 when `n > 1`. This is because the smallest Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 7, and subsequent primes in this sequence are not generated by simply incrementing and checking numbers congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. For example, the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 13, not 11 or 17 (which would be checked next according to the current logic).

To fix this, the function needs to generate the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes explicitly, not just check consecutive numbers. The provided implementation only checks a subset of possible candidates without generating the correct sequence. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
