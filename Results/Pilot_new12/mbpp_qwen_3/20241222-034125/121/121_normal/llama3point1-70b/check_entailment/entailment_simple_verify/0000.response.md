Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further confirms the issues present in the code. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly identify Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers because it includes all numbers of the form 6k ± 1 without verifying their primality. As a result, even though the `func_1` function correctly checks for primality, it is not used effectively within the loop that filters the numbers. This means that the program will return a number of the form 6k ± 1 that is not necessarily prime, which violates the requirement to find Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

For example, when `n = 2`, the program will include 41 (a prime number) and 25 (not a prime number) in its search, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would be to use `func_1` to check the primality of numbers that satisfy the 6k ± 1 condition, ensuring that only prime numbers of this form are counted.
