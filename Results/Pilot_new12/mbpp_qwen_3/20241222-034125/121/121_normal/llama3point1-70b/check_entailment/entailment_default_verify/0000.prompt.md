You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, it has a logical error in the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]:`. This condition checks if a number is of the form 6k ± 1, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a number to be prime. Additionally, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented for checking primality, but it is not used to filter out non-prime numbers in the loop where `num % 6 in [1, 5]` is checked. 

To illustrate, consider the following example:

For `n = 2`, the program should return the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the sequence, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 41, 239, etc. The program incorrectly includes all numbers of the form 6k ± 1, including non-prime numbers like 41 (which is prime), 25 (which is not prime), and so on. Therefore, the program will not correctly identify the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

A correct implementation would ensure that only prime numbers of the form 6k ± 1 are considered.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. It returns one of three values: 7, 8, or 9. 

- If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the function initializes `count` to 1 and sets `num` to 7. It then enters a loop where it checks if `num` satisfies certain conditions using `func_1(num)`. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `func_1(num)` is True, it increments `count`. When `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`.
- If no such `num` is found within the loop, the function will return 7.

The function ensures that if `n` is 1, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it searches for a suitable `num` that meets the specified conditions, and if such a `num` is found, it returns that value; otherwise, it falls back to returning 7.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
