You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the position (1-indexed) of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the position (1-indexed) of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number to be found, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is the last value that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]` and `func_1(num)` evaluates to True; if no such `num` is found, `num` remains its original value of 7.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
