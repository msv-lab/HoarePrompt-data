Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence. The function `func_2` starts checking from 7 and increments by 1, but it also checks only numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. However, this approach alone does not guarantee finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number because the sequence has specific properties beyond just these congruences.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence is defined such that each term \( p_n \) satisfies:
\[ p_{n+1}^2 - 2 = p_n^3 \]
with the initial term \( p_0 = 7 \).

The given implementation does not enforce this relationship and simply checks for primes and the modulo condition, which is insufficient. For example, the first few terms of the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence are 7, 41, 239, etc., and the code would fail to generate these correctly.

To verify, consider the first few terms:
- The first term is 7, which is correct.
- The second term should be 41, but the current implementation will continue checking numbers until it finds one that is prime and satisfies the modulo condition, which may not be efficient or correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the generated numbers satisfy the specific mathematical property of the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence.
