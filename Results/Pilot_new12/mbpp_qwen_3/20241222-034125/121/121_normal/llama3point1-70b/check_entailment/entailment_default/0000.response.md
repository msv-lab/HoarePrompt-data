Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number has issues. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth prime number that follows specific conditions (i.e., \( num \% 6 \) is either 1 or 5). However, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement this logic. It uses a while loop to find a prime number that meets the condition, but it does not ensure that the returned value is the nth such prime number. Instead, it returns 7 if `n` is 1, and for other values of `n`, it increments `num` until it finds a prime number that satisfies the condition without ensuring that the sequence of primes is correctly counted. 

For example, if `n` is 2, the function should return the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 11. However, the function does not correctly identify and return the sequence of primes that meet the criteria. Thus, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for all potential cases.
