Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out the logical error in the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]`. This condition alone does not guarantee that the number is prime, and the function `func_1` is not utilized effectively within this context. The output hints further confirm that the function is not correctly identifying the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Specifically, the hints mention that the function returns 7, 8, or 9 for various inputs, which does not align with the expected sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program does not meet the problem description.
