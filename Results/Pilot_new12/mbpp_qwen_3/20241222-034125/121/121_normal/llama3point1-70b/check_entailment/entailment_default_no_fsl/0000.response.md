Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code for `func_2` does not correctly implement the search for the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth prime number that satisfies the specific conditions (i.e., being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6). However, the current implementation returns either 7, 8, or 9 regardless of the value of `n`. This is evident from the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Prime Check**: The `func_1` function is correctly implemented for checking if a number is prime.
2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop in `func_2` does not correctly find the nth prime number that satisfies the conditions. Instead of incrementing `num` by 1 and checking the conditions, it will eventually fall into a loop where it repeatedly checks the same numbers (7, 8, 9) because the conditions `num % 6 in [1, 5]` are not met after the initial checks.

For example:
- If `n = 1`, the function correctly returns 7.
- If `n > 1`, the function will not find any other valid primes because the conditions `num % 6 in [1, 5]` are not met for numbers other than 7, 8, and 9.

To fix this, the loop should continue until the nth prime number satisfying the conditions is found, not just return fixed values.
