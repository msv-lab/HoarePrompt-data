Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number as per the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks whether a number is prime. It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and iterates through possible divisors up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This ensures that only prime numbers pass this check.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Base Case**: When `n == 1`, the function correctly returns 7, which is the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
   - **Main Loop**: For `n > 1`, the function initializes `count` to 1 (to account for the first prime, 7) and `num` to 7. It then enters a loop where it increments `num` and checks if `num` is a prime number using `func_1`.
     - If `num` is prime and satisfies the condition `num % 6 in [1, 5]` (since Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are of the form 6k ± 1), it increments the count.
     - Once the count matches `n`, the function returns `num` as the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
     - The loop continues until the correct prime is found.

The program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Checking for primality correctly.
- Using the specific form of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes (6k ± 1).
- Starting from the correct initial prime (7) and incrementing to find subsequent primes.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
