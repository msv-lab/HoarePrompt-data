The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. Specifically, it checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns `False`. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n` to check for divisibility. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`. The function does not perform any actions beyond these checks and returns either `True` or `False` based on the results of the prime number test.
