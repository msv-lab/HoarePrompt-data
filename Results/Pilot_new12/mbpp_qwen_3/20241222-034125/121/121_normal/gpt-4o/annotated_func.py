#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer and n is neither 0 nor 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S0` is the 0th term of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation \(S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0\) starting with \(S_0 = 1\) and \(S_1 = 1\), `S1` is the 1st term of the same sequence, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1 that is equal to 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either 1 or the value of `S1` calculated based on a specific recurrence relation. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it initializes `S0` and `S1` to 1 and iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `S0` and `S1` according to the recurrence relation \(S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0\). After the loop, it returns `S1`. The function ensures that `S1` holds the value of the `n`-th term in the sequence defined by the recurrence relation starting with initial values `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the base case where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1.
- The function correctly calculates `S1` for any positive integer `n` greater than 1 using the given recurrence relation.
- No explicit handling is required for negative integers or non-integer inputs since the function only accepts a positive integer `n`.
