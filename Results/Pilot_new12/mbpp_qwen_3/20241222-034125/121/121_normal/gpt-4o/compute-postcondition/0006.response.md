The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` updates the values of `S0` and `S1`. Initially, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, and `S_next` is 3. After executing the code, `S0` will take the value of `S1` (which is 1), and `S1` will take the value of `S_next` (which is 3). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
