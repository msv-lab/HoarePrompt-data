`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial values `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 3, `S_next` will be calculated as `2 * 3 + 1`, which equals 7. The value of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `S_next` is 7**
