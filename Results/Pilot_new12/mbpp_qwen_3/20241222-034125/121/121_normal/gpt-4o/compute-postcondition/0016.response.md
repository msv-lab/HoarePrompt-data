Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either 1 or the value of `S1` calculated based on a specific recurrence relation. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it initializes `S0` and `S1` to 1 and iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `S0` and `S1` according to the recurrence relation \(S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0\). After the loop, it returns `S1`. The function ensures that `S1` holds the value of the `n`-th term in the sequence defined by the recurrence relation starting with initial values `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the base case where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1.
- The function correctly calculates `S1` for any positive integer `n` greater than 1 using the given recurrence relation.
- No explicit handling is required for negative integers or non-integer inputs since the function only accepts a positive integer `n`.**

Note: The annotation stating "The program returns S1 that is equal to 1" is incorrect; the actual return value depends on the input `n` and the calculation based on the recurrence relation.
