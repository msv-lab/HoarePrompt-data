According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `2` and `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `S0` is 1
- `S1` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value within the range, which would be `3` (since `i` starts from `2` and the loop runs until `n + 1`).

Given that `n` is greater than `2`, the smallest possible value for `n` that allows another iteration is `3`. Therefore, if `i` is incremented to `3`, the loop can continue.

So, we adjust the states accordingly:
- `S0` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `S1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` is incremented to `3`.
- `n` must still be greater than `3` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
