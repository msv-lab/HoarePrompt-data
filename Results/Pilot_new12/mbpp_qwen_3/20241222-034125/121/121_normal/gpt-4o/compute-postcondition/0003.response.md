The code assigns the value `1` to both `S0` and `S1`. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer and is neither 0 nor 1, but this value does not affect the assignment to `S0` and `S1`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `S0` and `S1`.

Output State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and n is neither 0 nor 1**
