The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S_next`. Initially, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, and `S_next` is 17. After executing the code, `S0` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 17, and `S1` will take the value of `S0`, which was initially 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`S0` is 17, `S1` is 3, `S_next` is 17, `n` must be greater than 4**
