Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`.
   - The initial value of `i` is set by the loop itself, starting from `2`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `2`, the loop will run for all values of `i` from `2` to `n + 1`.

3. **Identify the Variables That Need to Be Adjusted:**
   - `S0` and `S1` are given as `1` each.
   - `n` is a positive integer and is neither `0` nor `1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Start:**
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be `2` (the starting value of the loop).
   - `n` must be greater than `2` (since the loop runs up to `n + 1`, and if `n` is `2` or less, the loop would not run).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `2`.
- `n` should be greater than `2`.

Given the initial conditions and the requirements for the loop to execute, the final state should be:

**State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
