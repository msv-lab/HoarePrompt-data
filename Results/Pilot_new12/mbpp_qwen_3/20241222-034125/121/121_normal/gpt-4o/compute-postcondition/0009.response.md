`S0` and `S1` are reassigned such that `S0` takes the value of `S1` (which is 3) and `S1` takes the value of `S_next` (which is 7). The values of the other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
