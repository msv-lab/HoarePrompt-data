Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `S0` is 3
   - `S1` is 7
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

5. **Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` (which is now 4) must still be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `S0` and `S1` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
   - `i` changes to 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
