`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial state where `S0` is 3 and `S1` is 7, we can calculate `S_next` as `2 * 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17`. The values of `S0` and `S1` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 4 remains valid.

Output State: **`S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `S_next` is 17, `n` must be greater than 4**
