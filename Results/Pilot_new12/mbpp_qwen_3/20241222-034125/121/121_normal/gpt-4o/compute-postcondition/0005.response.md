`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial state where `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1, the value of `S_next` will be `2 * 1 + 1`, which equals 3. The values of the other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `S_next` is 3**
