Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, which is a specific sequence of prime numbers. The sequence starts with the first few terms as 2, 7, 41, 239, 9677, etc., and is defined by the recurrence relation \(P_{n+1} = P_n^2 - 2\), starting from \(P_1 = 2\).

However, the provided program generates a different sequence defined by the recurrence relation \(S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0\), starting from \(S_0 = 1\) and \(S_1 = 1\). This sequence is not the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, and thus, the function does not generate the correct sequence of prime numbers as specified in the problem description.

To meet the problem description, the function should generate the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, which can be implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    a, b = 2, 3
    for _ in range(2, n):
        a, b = b, b**2 - 2
    return b
```

This corrected implementation correctly generates the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, which aligns with the problem description.
