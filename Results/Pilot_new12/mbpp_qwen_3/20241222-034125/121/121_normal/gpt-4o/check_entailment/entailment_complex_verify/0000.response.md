Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clarifies that the function `func_1` uses a recurrence relation to calculate a sequence starting with `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 1`. However, the problem description asks for the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime, which requires the sequence to start with `S0 = 0` and `S1 = 1`. Since the function does not use these correct initial conditions, it does not generate the correct NSW primes. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function returns incorrect values, further confirming the original assessment.
