Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Instead, it generates a sequence based on the recurrence relation \(S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0\) starting with \(S0 = 1\) and \(S1 = 1\). However, the problem description asks for the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is a different sequence. The output hints also confirm that the function returns values based on a specific recurrence relation, not prime numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
