Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number sequence. The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on a recurrence relation, but the recurrence relation used does not correspond to the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. According to the problem description, the function should return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the sequence generated by the given recurrence relation is different. For example, the first few terms of the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence are 2, 7, 41, 239, etc., which do not match the outputs given in the assertions (7, 17, 41 for n=3, 4, 5 respectively).

The correct implementation for the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence would involve generating prime numbers in a specific manner related to this sequence, which is not done in the provided code. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
