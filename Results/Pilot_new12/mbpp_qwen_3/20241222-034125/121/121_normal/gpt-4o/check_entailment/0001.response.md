Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. Instead, it appears to be generating a sequence based on a recurrence relation. To verify this, let's consider the first few terms of the sequence generated by the program:

- For `n = 0`, the output is `1`.
- For `n = 1`, the output is `1`.
- For `n = 2`, the output is `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
- For `n = 3`, the output is `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.
- For `n = 4`, the output is `2 * 7 + 3 = 17`.
- For `n = 5`, the output is `2 * 17 + 7 = 41`.

These values match the sequence defined by the recurrence relation but do not correspond to the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers, which are a specific subset of primes with a particular form related to the Fibonacci sequence. For instance, the first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are 2, 7, 41, 239, 929,... Notice that the value for `n = 0` in the problem description is 2, not 1. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.
