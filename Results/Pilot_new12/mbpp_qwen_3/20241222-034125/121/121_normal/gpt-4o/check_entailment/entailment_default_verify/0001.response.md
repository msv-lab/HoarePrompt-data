Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program generates a sequence based on a recurrence relation but does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` implements a specific sequence generation logic rather than prime number generation. The values returned by the function match the sequence defined by the recurrence relation, which is different from the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is thus incorrect.
