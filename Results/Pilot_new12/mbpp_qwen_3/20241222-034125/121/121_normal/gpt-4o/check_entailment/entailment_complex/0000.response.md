Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem description asks to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the program does not implement any logic to generate or check for Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Instead, the program computes a term in a sequence defined by a recurrence relation. 

The recurrence relation \( S_{i+1} = 2S_1 + S_0 \) starting with \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \) generates a different sequence altogether, and it does not produce Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Therefore, the function `func_1` does not fulfill the requirement to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
