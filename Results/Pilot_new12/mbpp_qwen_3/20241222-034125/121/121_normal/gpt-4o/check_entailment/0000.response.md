Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided is attempting to generate Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes, but it does so using a simplified recurrence relation instead of generating NSW primes directly. The recurrence relation used `(S_next = 2 * S1 + S0)` is actually used to generate NSW primes, but the initial conditions and the generation process are not correctly implemented for NSW primes.

The correct recurrence relation for NSW primes is given by:
\[ S_0 = 0, \]
\[ S_1 = 1, \]
\[ S_n = 2 \cdot S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \text{ for } n > 1. \]

However, the provided code initializes `S0` and `S1` to `1`, which does not match the correct initial conditions for NSW primes. This means that the output of the function will not be the correct NSW primes.

For example, the first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 1393, etc. Using the correct initial conditions and recurrence relation, we would get:
- For \( n = 3 \), the NSW prime is 41, not 7.
- For \( n = 4 \), the NSW prime is 239, not 17.
- For \( n = 5 \), the NSW prime is 1393, not 41.

Therefore, the program does not correctly generate the NSW primes for the given test cases and other potential cases, making it incorrect.
