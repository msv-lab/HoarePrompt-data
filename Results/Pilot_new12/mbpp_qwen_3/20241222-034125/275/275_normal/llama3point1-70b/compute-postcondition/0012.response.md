Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[1]` is 2, all other elements are 1, `dp[2]` is 3, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 2, and `len(nums)` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
