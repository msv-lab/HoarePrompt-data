Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 except for `dp[1]` which is 2, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is at least 2. If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[1]` remains 2. Otherwise, `dp[1]` remains 1.***
