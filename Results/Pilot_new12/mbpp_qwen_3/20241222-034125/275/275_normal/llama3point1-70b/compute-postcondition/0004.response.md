The code initializes a list `dp` with the value 1 repeated `len(nums)` times. The length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, and since `nums` is initially a list of integers sorted in ascending order, this information remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1, and the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1, and the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`.**
