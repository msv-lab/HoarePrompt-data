The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. The function returns either 0 or the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility in the list `nums`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest chain of divisibility.
