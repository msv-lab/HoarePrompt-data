`nums.sort()` sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. The sorting operation changes the order of elements in the list but does not change the number of elements or their types. The output state is: `nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order**
