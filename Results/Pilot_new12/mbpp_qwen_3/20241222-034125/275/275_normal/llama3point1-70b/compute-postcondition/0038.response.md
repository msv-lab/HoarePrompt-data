The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `nums`, or `dp`, only their general properties. Specifically, `i` is a positive integer and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2, `nums` is a list, and `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition given.

Given this, the code will update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since no specific values for `i`, `nums`, or `dp` are provided, we can't determine the exact numerical changes, but we can describe the state after the execution:

- `i` remains a positive integer and equals the previous value of `i` + 2.
- `nums` remains a list.
- `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Since the initial state and the specific values of `i`, `nums`, and `dp` are not provided in a concrete manner, we cannot provide more specific values for these variables after execution. However, we can describe the state changes as follows:

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer and equals the previous value of `i` + 2; `nums` is a list; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`**
