`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, but the specific values of `i`, `j`, `dp`, and `nums` are not provided. Therefore, the exact updated value of `dp[i]` cannot be determined, but it is guaranteed to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list, the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`**
