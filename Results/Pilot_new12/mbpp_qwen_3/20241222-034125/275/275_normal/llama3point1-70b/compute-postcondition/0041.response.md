Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, and `i` is `len(nums)`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - The inner loop runs from `0` to `i-1`.
   - For each `i`, the loop checks all previous elements `j` (where `j < i`) and updates `dp[i]` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

2. **After the First Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `1`.
   - The loop checks all previous elements (`j = 0`).
   - `dp[1]` is updated based on whether `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.

3. **After the Second Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `2`.
   - The loop checks both `j = 0` and `j = 1`.
   - `dp[2]` is updated based on the divisibility conditions.

4. **General Iteration:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will eventually become `len(nums)`.
   - `dp[i]` will hold the length of the longest chain of divisibility for each `nums[i]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - Once the loop completes, `i` will be `len(nums)`.
   - Each `dp[i]` will represent the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`.

6. **Edge Case:**
   - If the list `nums` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains `[1] * len(nums)` (each element initialized to 1).

Thus, the final state after the loop executes all iterations is that `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisibility for each element in `nums`, and `i` is `len(nums)`.
