Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer and equals the previous value of `i` + 2; `nums` is a list; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`.***
