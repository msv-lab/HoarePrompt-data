Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list. If the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as is when the condition is not met.***
