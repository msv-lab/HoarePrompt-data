Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `len(nums)` is at least 2.
   - `dp[1]` is updated based on a condition involving `nums[1]` and `nums[0]`.
   - `dp[2]` is set to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. Since `i` is 2, the loop will iterate over `j` values 0 and 1.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration (which means `j` was 1), we need to determine the state before the next iteration starts.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for updating `dp[1]` was checked when `j` was 1, and now we need to check it again for `j` being 2 (if applicable).
   - `dp[2]` needs to be updated based on the condition involving `nums[2]` and `nums[0]` or `nums[1]`.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `len(nums)` is at least 2.
- `dp[1]` is as it was after the previous iteration.
- `dp[2]` will be updated based on the new condition involving `nums[2]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, otherwise `dp[1]` remains unchanged, and `dp[2]` is set to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[2] % nums[1] == 0`**.
