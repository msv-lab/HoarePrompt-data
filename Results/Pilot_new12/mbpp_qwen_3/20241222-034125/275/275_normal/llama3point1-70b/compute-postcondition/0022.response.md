Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `len(nums)` is at least 2
   - `dp[1]` is updated to either `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = 0`. This means the loop will only execute once, updating the value of `dp[1]` based on the condition `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - After this iteration, `i` will increase by 1 (since the loop condition checks up to `i-1`), making `i` equal to 2.
   - `j` will be reset to 0 for the next iteration of the outer loop.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `len(nums)`, which is true since `len(nums)` is at least 2 and `i` is now 2.

5. **Adjusted States for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `j` will be 0.
   - `len(nums)` must still be at least 2.
   - `dp[1]`'s state remains as it was updated in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `len(nums)` is at least 2, and `dp[1]` is updated to either `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.**
