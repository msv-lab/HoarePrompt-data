The code snippet `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, or `dp`, only that `i` is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value of `i` + 1, and `nums` is a list.

Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, and the contents of `dp` are not given, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `dp[i]`. We can only say that `dp[i]` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1, `nums` is a list, `dp[i]` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`**
