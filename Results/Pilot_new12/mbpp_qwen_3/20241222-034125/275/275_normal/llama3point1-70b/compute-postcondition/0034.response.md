According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. The loop body updates the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `i` is a positive integer.
- `nums` is a list.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The loop will continue if `i` is still within the bounds of the list, meaning `i < len(nums)`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
- `j` will iterate from 0 to `i` (which is now `i + 1`), but since the loop runs up to `i - 1`, the upper bound for `j` remains `i - 1`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is a positive integer and equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1, `nums` is a list**.

To explicitly state the updated values:
State: **`i` is a positive integer and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1, `nums` is a list**.
