Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 except for `dp[1]` which is 2.
- The length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`.
- `i` is 1.
- `len(nums)` is at least 2.
- If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[1]` remains 2. Otherwise, `dp[1]` remains 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop `for j in range(i)` iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`. Given that `i` is currently `1`, the loop will iterate over `j = 0`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp[1]` is `2`.
   - `dp[0]` is `1` (since `i` is `1`, `dp` only has two elements initially).

3. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - During the first iteration (`j = 0`), the loop checks if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.
   - Since `i` is `1`, we check if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.
   - If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[1]` remains `2`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[1]` remains `1`.

4. **After the First Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` (from `1` to `2`).
   - `dp` remains unchanged because the loop only iterates once when `i` is `1`.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is now `2`.
- `nums` remains the same (sorted in ascending order).
- `dp` remains `[1, 2]` (unchanged because the condition for `dp[1]` did not change during the first iteration).
- `len(nums)` is at least `2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 except for `dp[1]` which is 2, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 2, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.**
