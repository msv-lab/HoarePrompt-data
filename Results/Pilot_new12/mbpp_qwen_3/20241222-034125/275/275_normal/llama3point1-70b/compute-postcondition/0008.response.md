The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1, and there exists a `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

Let's assume `i = 1`, and there exists a `j` (let's say `j = 0` for simplicity) such that `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`. This means `dp[1]` will be updated to `max(dp[1], dp[0] + 1)`.

Since initially, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1, `dp[0]` is 1. Therefore, `dp[1]` will be updated to `max(1, 1 + 1) = 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 except for `dp[1]` which is 2, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1 except for `dp[1]` which is 2, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.**
