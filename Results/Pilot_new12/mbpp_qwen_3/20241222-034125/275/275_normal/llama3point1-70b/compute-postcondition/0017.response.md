Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`.
   - The length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`.
   - `i` is `len(nums)`.
   - `len(nums)` is at least 2.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(1, len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(nums)`.
   - Since `i` is currently `len(nums)`, the condition `i < len(nums)` is false, and the loop does not execute.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `1` (the start of the range).
   - However, since the loop does not execute when `i` is `len(nums)`, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing from `i = 1`.

5. **Modified State:**
   - `i` should be `1` to start the loop execution.
   - `len(nums)` remains the same as it is already at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.**
