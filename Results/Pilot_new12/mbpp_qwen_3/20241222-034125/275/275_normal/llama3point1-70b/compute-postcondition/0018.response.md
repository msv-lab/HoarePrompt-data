State: **`i` is 1, `j` is now 0, `len(nums)` is at least 2**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The initial state provided is that `i` should be `1` to start the loop execution.
   - `len(nums)` remains the same and is already at least 2, so no adjustment is needed for this.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 (which is already given).
   - The loop variable `j` will start from `0` and increment until it reaches `i`.

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` is set to `1`, the loop will start with `j = 0` and run once (`j` will be incremented to `1` after the first iteration).
   - Therefore, we need to explicitly state that `j` is now `0` at the beginning of the loop.

4. **Final State:**
   - `i` should be `1` to start the loop execution.
   - `j` should be `0` because it starts from `0` when `i` is `1`.
   - `len(nums)` is already at least `2`, so no adjustment is needed here.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is now 0
- `len(nums)` is at least 2

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is now 0, `len(nums)` is at least 2**
