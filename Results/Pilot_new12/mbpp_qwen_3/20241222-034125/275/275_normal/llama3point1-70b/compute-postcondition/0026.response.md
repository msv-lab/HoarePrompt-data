First, let's review the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `len(nums)` is at least 2
- `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, otherwise `dp[1]` remains unchanged
- `dp[2]` is set to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[2] % nums[1] == 0`

Given the code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

This line of code updates `dp[i]` (where `i` is 2) to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` (where `j` is 2).

Since `i` and `j` are both 2, this simplifies to:
```python
dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[2] + 1)
```

This implies that `dp[2]` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and itself plus 1. However, since any number is not larger than itself plus one, the actual effect is that `dp[2]` will be `dp[2] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[2]` will be one more than its original value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[0] + 1` if `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0`, otherwise `dp[1]` remains unchanged, `dp[2]` is increased by 1**
