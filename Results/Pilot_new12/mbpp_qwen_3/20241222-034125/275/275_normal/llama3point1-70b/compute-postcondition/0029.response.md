According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(nums)`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(nums)`.
   - Since the condition for the loop is `i < len(nums)`, after incrementing `i` by 1, the condition `i < len(nums)` will no longer hold true.

3. **Adjust the necessary states:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `len(nums)`.
   - `n` (which represents the length of `nums`) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `len(nums)`, `nums` must be a list**
