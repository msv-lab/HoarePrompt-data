Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp[1]` is 2, `dp[2]` is 4, all other elements of `dp` are 1, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[2]` is set to twice the value of `nums[j]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
