To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `i` is a positive integer and equals the previous value of `i` + 1.
   - `nums` is a list.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`.
- For each value of `j` in this range, the loop updates `dp[i]` based on the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

### Key Points:
- The loop depends on the values of `i` and `j`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, meaning it is now one more than the previous value.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented further, and `j` will iterate from `0` to `i-1` (excluding `i`).

### Updated States:
- Since `i` was the previous value of `i` + 1, in the next iteration, `i` will be the new value of `i` + 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should range from `0` to `i-1`.

### Final State:
- `i` will be the previous value of `i` + 1 + 1 = previous value of `i` + 2.
- `nums` remains the same list.
- `dp[i]` will be updated according to the loop logic as described.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is a positive integer and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2, `nums` is a list, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
