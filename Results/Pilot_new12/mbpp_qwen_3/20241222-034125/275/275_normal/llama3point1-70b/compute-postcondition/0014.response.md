`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` and `j` are both 2, `dp[i]` is `dp[2]`, which is initially 3. `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`, which is also 3. Therefore, `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum of 3 and 3 + 1, which is 4.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp[1]` is 2, all other elements of `dp` are 1 (including `dp[2]` which was updated to 4), the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp[1]` is 2, `dp[2]` is 4, all other elements of `dp` are 1, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2.**
