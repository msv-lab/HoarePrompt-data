Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop variable here is `j`, which ranges from `0` to `i - 1`. Therefore, the key variables involved are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < i`. This means `i` must be greater than 0 for at least one iteration to occur.

3. **Initial State**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `len(nums)` and `nums` must be a list.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `len(nums)`, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 (which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 0).
   - The initial value of `j` is not specified, but since the loop starts with `j = 0`, it will execute as long as `i > 0`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0, and `nums` remains a list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `nums` must be a list**
