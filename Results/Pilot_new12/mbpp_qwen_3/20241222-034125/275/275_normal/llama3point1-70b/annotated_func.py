    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`, the length of `dp` is the same as the length of `nums`, and `i` is `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility in the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as a parameter. If `nums` is an empty list, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `nums` in ascending order and then computes the length of the longest chain of divisibility within `nums`. A chain of divisibility is defined as a sequence of numbers in `nums` where each number divides the next one without leaving a remainder. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `dp`, which corresponds to the length of the longest chain of divisibility in `nums`. The function handles the case when `nums` is empty by returning 0, and it ensures that the list is sorted before computing the chains of divisibility.
