Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible by each other. Here's a detailed explanation of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is the correct size of the largest subset in this case (an empty subset).

2. **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in efficiently finding pairs where one number divides another because for any two indices `i` and `j` with `i > j`, if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `nums[i]` can be part of a chain starting from `nums[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - A `dp` array is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`.
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the list (starting from the second element), the function checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`).
   - If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which corresponds to the length of the longest chain of divisibility in the entire list.

This approach ensures that the function finds the correct size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible by each other, adhering to the problem description perfectly.
