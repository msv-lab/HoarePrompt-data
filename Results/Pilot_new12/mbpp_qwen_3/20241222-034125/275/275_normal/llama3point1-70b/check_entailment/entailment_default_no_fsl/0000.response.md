Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The code handles the case where the input list is empty by returning 0. It sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to build the `dp` array, ensuring that each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`. The final result is obtained by returning the maximum value in the `dp` array. The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
