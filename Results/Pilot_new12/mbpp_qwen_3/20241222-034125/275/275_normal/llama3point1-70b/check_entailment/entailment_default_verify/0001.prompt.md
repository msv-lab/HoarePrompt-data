You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The program handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty by returning 0, which is correct.
2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted before processing. This ensures that for any two indices `i` and `j` (where `i > j`), `nums[i]` will always be greater than or equal to `nums[j]`, simplifying the divisibility check.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The `dp` array is used to store the size of the largest subset ending at each index. For each element `nums[i]`, the program checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.
4. **Final Result**: The maximum value in the `dp` array gives the size of the largest subset meeting the criteria.

Since the provided logic seems to cover all necessary conditions and the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases that this implementation might miss, we conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as a parameter. If `nums` is an empty list, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list `nums` in ascending order and then computes the length of the longest chain of divisibility within `nums`. A chain of divisibility is defined as a sequence of numbers in `nums` where each number divides the next one without leaving a remainder. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `dp`, which corresponds to the length of the longest chain of divisibility in `nums`. The function handles the case when `nums` is empty by returning 0, and it ensures that the list is sorted before computing the chains of divisibility.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
