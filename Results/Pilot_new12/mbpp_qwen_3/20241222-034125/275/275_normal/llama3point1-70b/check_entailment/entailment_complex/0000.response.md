Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling Empty List**: 
   - The program checks if the list `nums` is empty and returns `0` immediately if it is. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order using `nums.sort()`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that elements can be checked in a linear fashion for divisibility.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with all values set to `1` because the minimum size of any subset (chain of divisibility) is `1` (each element itself).
   - The nested loops iterate through each pair of elements in the list. For each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `j < i`, it checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - This ensures that `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest chain of divisibility ending at `nums[i]`.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases as specified, the program is correct.
