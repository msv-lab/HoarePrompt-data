The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of positive integers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and computes the length of the longest chain of divisors for each element in the list. It uses dynamic programming to build a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the entire list `nums`.
