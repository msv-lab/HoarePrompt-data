Output State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `dp[i]` remains 1 (as `dp[i]` is initially set to 1).**
