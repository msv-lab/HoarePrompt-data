The `sort()` method is called on the `nums` list, which sorts the list in ascending order. The original values of the elements in `nums` are rearranged, but the identity of the list remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order**
