According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` must have at least 1 element.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` will have reached the length of `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but it still needs to be less than the length of `nums`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is now `len(nums)` (to reflect that the current index has reached the end) and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums) + 1`.

State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` must be less than the length of `nums` + 1**
