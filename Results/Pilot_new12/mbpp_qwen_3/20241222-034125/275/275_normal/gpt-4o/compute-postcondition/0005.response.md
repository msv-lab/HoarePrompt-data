State before the loop starts: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 because the range function starts from `0` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`.
3. The variable `i` will take on values starting from `0` up to `len(nums) - 1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the list `nums` has at least one element to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `nums` must have at least 1 element (i.e., `len(nums) >= 1`).

Since the initial state already mentions that `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, we only need to ensure that the list has at least one element.

State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`**
