The code initializes a list `dp` with a length equal to the length of the `nums` list, where each element is set to 1. The original list `nums` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`**
