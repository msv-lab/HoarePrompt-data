Output State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `i` is the length of `nums`, and `previous_i` is the last index `i` was set to.**
