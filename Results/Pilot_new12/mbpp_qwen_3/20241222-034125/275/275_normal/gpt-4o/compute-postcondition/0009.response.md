Postcondition: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` must be greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur in the postcondition.**
