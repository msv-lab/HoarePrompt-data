`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Here, `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0, which means `i` is at least 1. The value of `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is some index. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `j`, `dp[j]` is assumed to be 1 (as per the initial state where `dp` is a list of ones).

Therefore, the value of `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum between its current value (which is 1) and `1 + 1`, which is 2. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0; `dp[i]` is the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is some index, and the value of `dp[i]` is updated to 2.**
