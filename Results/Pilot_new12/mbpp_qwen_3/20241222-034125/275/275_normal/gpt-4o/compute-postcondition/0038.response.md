The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. However, the initial value of `i` is given as `i+1`, which suggests that `i` is being updated from some previous value. Since `i` is set to `i+1`, the new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus one. The value of `previous_i` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `prev_i`. Then, the new value of `i` is `prev_i + 1`.

The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is not defined in the snippet, we cannot specify the exact value of `dp[j]`. However, the code only affects `dp[i]` and `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is unchanged, `dp[prev_i + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[prev_i + 1]` and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is `prev_i + 1`, `previous_i` remains unchanged**
