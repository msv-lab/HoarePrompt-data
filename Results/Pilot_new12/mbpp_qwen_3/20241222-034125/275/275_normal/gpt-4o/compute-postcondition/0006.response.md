According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1, because the loop runs from `0` to `i-1`. Given the initial state:

- `nums` must have at least 1 element.
- `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `dp` has the same length as `nums`, `i` should be within the bounds of `dp` and `nums`.

State: **`total` is not applicable (since no variable named total is involved), `nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
