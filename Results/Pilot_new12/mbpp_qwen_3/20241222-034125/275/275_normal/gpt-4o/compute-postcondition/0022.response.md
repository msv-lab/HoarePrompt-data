According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1` with the variable `j`. The loop's continuation depends on the values of `i` and the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `nums` must have at least 1 element.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is less than the length of `nums` + 1.
- `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, the original values of `dp` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be less than the length of `nums`.
- `j` should start from 0 and go up to `i`.

Since we are moving to the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be equal to the current value of `i` plus 1, which means `i` will be less than the length of `nums`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `j` will start from 0 and go up to the new value of `i - 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`**
