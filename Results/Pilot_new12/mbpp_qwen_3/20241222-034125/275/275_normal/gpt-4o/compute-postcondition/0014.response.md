`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Given that `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 1, and `j` is an index used in the calculation, the value of `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is not specified, it could be any valid index in the range of `dp`. However, without knowing the exact value of `j`, we can only say that `dp[i]` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some valid index `j`.**
