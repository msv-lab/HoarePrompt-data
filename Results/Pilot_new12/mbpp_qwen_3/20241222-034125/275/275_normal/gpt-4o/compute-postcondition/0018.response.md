State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` must be less than the length of `nums` + 1, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `range(i)`, meaning `j` will take values from `0` to `i-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, there must be elements in the range `0` to `i-1` (inclusive).
3. Since `i` must be less than the length of `nums` + 1, we already know that `i` is within bounds for the array `nums`.
4. Therefore, `j` must start from `0` and go up to `i-1` for the loop to execute properly.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to include the initial value of `j` as `0`.
