The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is true for some valid `j`. 

- The value of `i` is at least 1.
- The value of `previous_i` is 0 if `i` is 1.
- The condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` being true means there exists some `j` such that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Since `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `dp[i]` will take the value of `dp[j] + 1` if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is initialized appropriately, `i` is at least 1, `previous_i` is 0 if `i` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some valid `j`.**
