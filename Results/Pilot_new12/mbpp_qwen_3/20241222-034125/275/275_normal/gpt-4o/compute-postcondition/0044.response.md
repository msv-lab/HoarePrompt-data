Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of positive integers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and computes the length of the longest chain of divisors for each element in the list. It uses dynamic programming to build a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the entire list `nums`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `nums` is an empty list, the function returns 0.
- The function handles a non-empty list of positive integers and calculates the longest chain of divisors correctly.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the function returns 0 in Case_1, which is correct. However, the annotation also mentions Case_2, which is covered by the function's logic as described. There are no additional missing functionalities based on the provided code and annotations.
