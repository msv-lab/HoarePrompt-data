Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. For all `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, and for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
