Postcondition: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is less than the length of `nums` + 1, `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, the original values of `dp` remain unchanged.**
