According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. This means the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `nums` must still have at least 1 element.
- `dp` remains a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is now `i + 1` and must still be greater than 0.

Since `i` was already greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 ensures it remains greater than 0 unless `i` was exactly 0, which is not possible based on the given conditions.

State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0**
