Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Therefore, the variable `i` is crucial.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what `j` should be within the range `0` to `i-1`.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `nums` has at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from `0` to the length of `nums` - 2, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is either 1 or an updated value.
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because the range of the loop is from `0` to `i-1`. Hence, `i` should be at least 1.
   - `previous_i` is used to determine the current `i`. Since `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `previous_i` should be 0 when `i` is 1.

4. **Construct the Final State:**
   - `nums` has at least one element.
   - `dp` is initialized appropriately (though its exact values are not relevant for the loop's execution).
   - `i` should be at least 1.
   - `previous_i` should be 0 if `i` is 1.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`nums` has at least one element, `i` is 1, `previous_i` is 0**
