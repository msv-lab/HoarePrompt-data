To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop variable `j` and how it relates to `i`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a specific value, say `i_end_prev`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to iterate through all values from `0` to `i_end_prev - 1`.

Since the loop is about to start for the next `i`, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_next`. This means the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = i_next - 1`.

The key point here is that `i` (now `i_next`) will be incremented by 1 compared to the end of the previous iteration.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nums` has at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's say `i_end_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
     - `nums` has at least one element.
     - `dp` is a list where `dp[i_end_prev]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i_end_prev]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will now start with `i = i_end_prev + 1`.
   - For this new `i`, the state should reflect that `i` is now `i_end_prev + 1`.
   - All elements of `dp` from `0` to `i_end_prev - 1` are already computed.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - The value of `dp[i_end_prev + 1]` will be determined based on the values of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `0` to `i_end_prev`.

### Final State:
- `nums` still has at least one element.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i_end_prev + 1]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i_end_prev + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i_end_prev + 1]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i_end_prev + 1]`.**
