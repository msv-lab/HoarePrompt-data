The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the value of `dp[i]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[j]`.

The output state will be:

- `dp[i]` is updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
- The states of `nums`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the update to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`**
