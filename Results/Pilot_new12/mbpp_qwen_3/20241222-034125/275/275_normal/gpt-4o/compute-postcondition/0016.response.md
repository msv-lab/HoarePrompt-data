To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step based on the given code and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `nums` must have at least 1 element.
- `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp` starts as a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop (which we will consider later).

2. **Inner Loop (`j` loop)**:
   - For each `i`, the inner loop runs from `0` to `i-1`.
   - If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Effect on `dp`**:
   - `dp[i]` is updated based on the values of `dp[j]` where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - The maximum value of `dp[i]` will be influenced by the previous values of `dp[j]` that satisfy the divisibility condition.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations of the outer loop, `i` will have iterated through all indices of `nums` (from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`).
   - The final value of `dp[i]` for each index `i` will be the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

### Conclusion:
- After the loop completes, `dp[i]` will contain the length of the longest chain of divisors for each element `nums[i]`.
- The length of the longest chain of divisors for an element `nums[i]` is determined by the previous elements in `nums` that divide `nums[i]`.

### Output State:
- The final state of `dp` will be a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `nums` will retain its original values since the loop does not modify it directly.
- `i` will have reached `len(nums)` after all iterations.

Thus, the output state is:

**Output State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` will have reached the length of `nums`.**
