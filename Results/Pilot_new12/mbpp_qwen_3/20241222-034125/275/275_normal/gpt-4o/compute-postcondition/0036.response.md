Postcondition: ***`nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `previous_i` remain as they are, unless `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some valid `j`, in which case `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. `i` is at least 2, and `previous_i` is 0 if `i` is 1. Other variables remain unchanged.***
