Postcondition: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0. If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `dp[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
