According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. The loop body processes each `j` and updates the `dp` array based on the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `nums` has at least one element.
- `dp` is initialized appropriately.
- `i` is at least 1.
- `previous_i` is 0 if `i` is 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some valid `j`.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, we need to update the state as follows:

1. The value of `i` will increase by 1 because the loop is iterating from `j = 0` to `i-1`, and after processing all `j` up to `i-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i+1`.
2. `dp[i]` will be updated based on the same logic as before, but now considering `j` values from `0` to `i`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is initialized appropriately, `i` is at least 2, `previous_i` is 0 if `i` is 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` where `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some valid `j`.**
