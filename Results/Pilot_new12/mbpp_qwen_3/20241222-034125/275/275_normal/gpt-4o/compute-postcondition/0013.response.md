Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `nums` must have at least 1 element.
   - `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
   - `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
   - If true, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, and it is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`, the variable `j` will be incremented in each iteration.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is still within the bounds of `nums`.

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be within the bounds of `nums`, i.e., `i < len(nums)`.
   - Since `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 0, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `nums` must have at least 1 element (unchanged).
   - `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums` (unchanged).
   - `i` is `i + 1` and must now be greater than 0 (now `i + 1`).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 1.**
