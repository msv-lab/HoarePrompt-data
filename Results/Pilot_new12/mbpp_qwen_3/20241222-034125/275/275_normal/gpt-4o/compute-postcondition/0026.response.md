The code snippet updates the `dp` list such that for each index `i`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` where `j` is a previous index in the list `nums`. This means that for each element in `nums`, the corresponding `dp` value is updated based on the longest chain of divisors found so far.

Given the initial state where `nums` has at least one element and `dp[i_end_prev + 1]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i_end_prev + 1]`, the code updates the `dp` list for the current `i`.

Let's consider the specific steps:

1. For each `i` in the range of `len(nums)`, the line `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` checks the current value of `dp[i]` and updates it to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` where `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`.

Since the exact elements of `nums` and their relationships are not specified, we can only state that for each `i`, `dp[i]` will be updated to the maximum length of the chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp[i]` for each `i` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` where `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`.**
