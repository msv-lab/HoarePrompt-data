Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums`: Remains unchanged.
   - `dp`: Remains unchanged unless `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some valid `j`, in which case `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - `i`: Is at least 2.
   - `previous_i`: Is 0 if `i` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as the previous `i`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - For each `j`, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - Since `i` is at least 2, the loop will start from `j = 0` and go up to `i-1` (which means `j` will start from 0 and go up to `i-1`).
   - We need to ensure that `i` increases by 1 for the next iteration because the loop is defined as `for j in range(i)`.

Given these points, we can conclude that `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and other variables (`nums`, `dp`, and `previous_i`) remain unchanged.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `nums`: Remains unchanged.
- `dp`: Remains unchanged.
- `i`: Increases by 1 (so if `i` was `k` before, now `i` is `k+1`).
- `previous_i`: Remains the same as the previous `i` unless `i` was 1, in which case `previous_i` becomes 0.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nums`, `dp`, `i` is `i+1`, `previous_i` remains unchanged**.
