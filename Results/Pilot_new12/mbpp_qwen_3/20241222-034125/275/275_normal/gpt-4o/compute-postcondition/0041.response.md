Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[len(nums) - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`.
- For each element `i`, it checks all previous elements `j` (where `j < i`).
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- After the loop completes, `dp` will contain the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at each element of `nums`.
- Specifically, `dp[len(nums) - 1]` will be the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at the last element of `nums`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `nums` is an empty list), then `dp` remains a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, which would be an empty list in this case. However, since the problem specifies that `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, we assume `nums` is not empty.
