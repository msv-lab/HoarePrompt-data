Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` has at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
   - If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, `dp[i]` remains 1 (as `dp[i]` is initially set to 1).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it processes each element `nums[i]` and updates the `dp` list based on the divisibility rules.
   - We need to determine what changes in the state after one full iteration of the loop.

5. **State After One Full Iteration:**
   - The loop will process the next index `i+1` in the subsequent iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

6. **Modified States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - The `dp` list will have been updated for all indices from `0` to `previous_i`.

7. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `nums` still has at least one element.
   - `dp` now contains updated values for the longest chain of divisors ending at each `nums[i]` for `i` up to `previous_i`.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will start with `i = previous_i + 1`.

Based on this analysis:

**State: **`nums` has at least one element, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 2, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is either 1 or an updated value, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**
