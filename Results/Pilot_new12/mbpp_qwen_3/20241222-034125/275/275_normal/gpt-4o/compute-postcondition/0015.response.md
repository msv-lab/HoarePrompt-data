Postcondition: **`nums` must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is `i + 1` and must be greater than 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. There is no change in the list `dp` if the condition is not met.**
