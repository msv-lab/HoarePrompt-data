    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[len(nums) - 1]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list dp, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the list nums
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of positive integers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and computes the length of the longest chain of divisors for each element in the list. It uses dynamic programming to build a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the entire list `nums`.
