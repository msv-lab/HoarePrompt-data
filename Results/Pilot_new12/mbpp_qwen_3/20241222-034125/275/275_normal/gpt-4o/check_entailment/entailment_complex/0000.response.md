Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution for finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible by each other. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of positive integers.
   - The function checks if the list is empty using the condition `if (not nums)`. If the list is empty, it returns 0, which is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Sorting and Dynamic Programming**:
   - The list `nums` is sorted in ascending order using `nums.sort()`. This step ensures that all potential divisors come before their multiples in the sorted list.
   - A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with 1s, representing the base case where each element is a subset of size 1.
   - The nested loops iterate through each element in the list, comparing it with all previous elements to check divisibility. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (where `j < i`), the DP value `dp[i]` is updated to reflect the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible by each other.

Given these steps, the program correctly identifies the largest subset of the input list where every pair of elements is divisible. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description in all cases.
