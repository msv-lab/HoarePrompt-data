Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. Given the test cases provided:

1. For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the output is `4`, which is correct because the subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` satisfies the condition.
2. For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the output is `3`, which is correct because the subset `[5, 10, 20]` satisfies the condition.
3. For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the output is `4`, which is correct because the subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` satisfies the condition.

Since the function handles the provided test cases correctly and the logic appears sound, there is no apparent flaw that would cause the function to fail for other potential cases. Therefore, the function meets the problem description for the given examples and potential cases.
