Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers as input. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if it is. This handles the case where the input list might be empty, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Sorting is a necessary step to ensure that when checking divisibility, all potential pairs can be efficiently evaluated.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subset ending at index `i`. For each element `nums[i]`, the program iterates over all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to check if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **Result Calculation**: After filling the `dp` array, the program returns the maximum value in `dp`, which corresponds to the length of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible.

The provided test cases also align with this logic:
- For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the largest subset where every pair is divisible is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.
- For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`, which has a size of 3.
- For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the largest subset is again `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.

Thus, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description for all valid inputs.
