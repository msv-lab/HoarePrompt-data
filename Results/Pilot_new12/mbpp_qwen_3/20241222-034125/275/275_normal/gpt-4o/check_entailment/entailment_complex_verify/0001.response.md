Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points and support the correctness of the function. The function handles the provided test cases correctly, and the logic appears sound. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
