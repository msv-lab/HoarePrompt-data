You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The function uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum subset size ending at each index. Given the test cases provided:

1. For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the output is `4`, which is correct because the subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` satisfies the condition.
2. For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the output is `3`, which is correct because the subset `[5, 10, 20]` satisfies the condition.
3. For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the output is `4`, which is correct because the subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` satisfies the condition.

Since the function handles the provided test cases correctly and the logic appears sound, there is no apparent flaw that would cause the function to fail for other potential cases. Therefore, the function meets the problem description for the given examples and potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[len(nums) - 1]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list dp, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the list nums
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of positive integers. If the list is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and computes the length of the longest chain of divisors for each element in the list. It uses dynamic programming to build a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors in the entire list `nums`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
