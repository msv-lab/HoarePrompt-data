Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The function `func_1` sorts the list first and then uses dynamic programming to find the longest chain of divisors. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected by returning the length of the longest chain of divisors.

Given the test cases:
- For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.
- For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`, which has a size of 3.
- For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.

The provided code handles these cases correctly. Additionally, the logic for sorting the list and using dynamic programming ensures that all pairs in the subset are divisible, adhering to the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the code is not handling based on the given problem description and test cases.
