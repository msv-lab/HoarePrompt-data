Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The logic in the function iterates over a range starting from 2 (the first even natural number) and ends at `n * 2`, ensuring that only even numbers are considered. The use of a generator expression within the `sum` function computes the cube of each even number in this range and sums them up, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment of its correctness is valid.
