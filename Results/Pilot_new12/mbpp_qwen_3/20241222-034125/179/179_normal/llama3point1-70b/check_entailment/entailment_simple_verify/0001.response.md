Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Specifically:

- The function starts with the first even number, which is `2`, and uses a step of `2` in the `range` function to generate the sequence of even numbers up to `2n`.
- The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` generates the cubes of these even numbers.
- The `sum()` function correctly adds these cubes together.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the program meets the requirements and performs the intended calculation accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
