Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this:

- The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate cubes of the first `n` even numbers.
- It starts from `2` (the first even number) and increments by `2` each time to get the next even number up to `2n`.
- The `sum()` function then adds these cubes together.

For example:
- For `n = 1`, the even number is `2`, so the cube sum is `2^3 = 8`.
- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `2` and `4`, so the cube sum is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.

Since the function correctly computes the cube sum for the first `n` even natural numbers for any valid input `n`, the program is correct.
