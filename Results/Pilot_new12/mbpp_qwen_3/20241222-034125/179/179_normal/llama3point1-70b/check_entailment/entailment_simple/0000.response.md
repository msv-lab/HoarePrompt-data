Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why:

- The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
- It uses a generator expression `i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` to generate the cubes of the even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
- The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 and increments by 2 each time, effectively generating the first `n` even natural numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 2n).
- The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of these cubes.
- Since the problem description asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, this implementation meets the requirements for all valid inputs `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
