Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotation states that the program returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n*2 + 1`, which aligns with the problem description. The examples provided in the original assessment also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
