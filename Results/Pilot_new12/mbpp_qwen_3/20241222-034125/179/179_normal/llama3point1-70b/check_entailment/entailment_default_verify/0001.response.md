Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers based on the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function iterates over a range starting from 2 and ending at `n * 2`, ensuring only even numbers are considered. It calculates the cube of each even number in this range and sums them up. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, no changes are needed to the original assessment.
