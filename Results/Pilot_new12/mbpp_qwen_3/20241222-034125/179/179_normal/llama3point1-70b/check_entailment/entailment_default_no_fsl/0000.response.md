Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function iterates over a range starting from 2 and ending at `n * 2` (exclusive), incrementing by 2 to ensure only even numbers are considered. It then computes the cube of each even number and sums them up. This matches the problem description, which asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The output hints also confirm this behavior, and no counterexamples have been found where the program does not meet the requirements.
