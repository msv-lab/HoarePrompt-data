Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this with a few examples:

- For `n = 1`, the first even natural number is 2. So, the cube sum should be \(2^3 = 8\). The function returns `sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, 2 * 1 + 1, 2))) = 8`, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. So, the cube sum should be \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\). The function returns `sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, 2 * 2 + 1, 2))) = 72`, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, the cube sum should be \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\). The function returns `sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, 2 * 3 + 1, 2))) = 288`, which is correct.

Since the function works correctly for these examples and the logic is sound, it meets the requirements for finding the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for any positive integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
