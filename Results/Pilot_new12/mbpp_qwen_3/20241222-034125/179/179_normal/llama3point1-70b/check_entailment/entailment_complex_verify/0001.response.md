Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over a range starting from 2 (the first even number) and ends at `n * 2`, ensuring only even numbers are considered. It calculates the cube of each even number in this range and sums them up. The examples provided in the original assessment also correctly illustrate the function's behavior for different values of `n`. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as correct.
