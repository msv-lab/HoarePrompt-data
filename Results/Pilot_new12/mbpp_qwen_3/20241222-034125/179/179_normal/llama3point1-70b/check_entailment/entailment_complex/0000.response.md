Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
   - The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n * 2 + 1`.
   - For `n = 1`, the range is `2` (since `2 < 3`), and the sum is `2^3 = 8`.
   - For `n = 2`, the range is `2, 4` (since `2 < 6`), and the sum is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
   - This pattern continues for any positive integer `n`.

The function correctly handles the calculation of the sum of cubes of even numbers as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
