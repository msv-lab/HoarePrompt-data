Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. The range function `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 and increments by 2, ensuring only even numbers are considered. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` computes the cube of each even number in this range, and the `sum()` function adds them up. This approach correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, as long as the input `n` is a positive integer.
