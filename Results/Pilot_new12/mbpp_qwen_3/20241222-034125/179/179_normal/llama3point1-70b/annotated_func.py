#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including n*2 + 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. The function iterates over a range of numbers starting from 2 and ending at `n * 2`, incrementing by 2 to ensure only even numbers are considered. It calculates the cube of each even number in this range and sums them up.
