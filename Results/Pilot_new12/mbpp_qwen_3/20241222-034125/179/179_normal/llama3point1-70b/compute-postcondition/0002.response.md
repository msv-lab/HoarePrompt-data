Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. The function iterates over a range of numbers starting from 2 and ending at `n * 2`, incrementing by 2 to ensure only even numbers are considered. It calculates the cube of each even number in this range and sums them up.**

Edge Cases:
- If `n` is 0, the range will start from 2 and end at 1 (not including), resulting in no numbers being processed, and thus the sum will be 0.
- If `n` is 1, the range will start from 2 and end at 3 (not including), processing only the number 2, resulting in a sum of \(2^3 = 8\).

Missing Functionality:
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code. However, if `n` were negative, the function would still operate as intended because the range starts from 2 and ends before `n * 2 + 1`, which would result in an empty range and a sum of 0.
