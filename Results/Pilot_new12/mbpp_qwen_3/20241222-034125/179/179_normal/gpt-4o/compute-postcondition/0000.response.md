The code creates a list of even numbers from 2 up to `2 * n`. The list comprehension iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, multiplying each value of `i` by 2. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer, and this list is stored in the variable `even_numbers`. After executing the code, `n` remains a positive integer, and `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers generated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n]`**
