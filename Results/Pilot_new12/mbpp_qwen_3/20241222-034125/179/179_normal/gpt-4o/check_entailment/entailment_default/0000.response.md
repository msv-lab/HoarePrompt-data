Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions given in the output hints verify that the function works correctly for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

The code generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension and then calculates the sum of their cubes. The provided assertions match the expected results:

- For `n = 2`, the first two even numbers are `[2, 4]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64]`, and their sum is `72`.
- For `n = 3`, the first three even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`, and their sum is `288`.
- For `n = 4`, the first four even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Their cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`, and their sum is `800`.

Since the function handles positive integers correctly and the provided examples and assertions validate its correctness, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the constraints of the problem description.
