Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions given in the program itself serve as test cases:

- For `func_1(2)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64]`. The sum is `72`, which matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(3)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`. The sum is `288`, which matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(4)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`. The sum is `800`, which matches the assertion.

The program uses list comprehension to generate the even numbers and a generator expression to compute their cubes before summing them up. This approach ensures that the cube sum is calculated accurately for the first `n` even natural numbers. Since all provided test cases are satisfied and no edge cases contradict the program's logic, the program is correct.
