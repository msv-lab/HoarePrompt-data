Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The test cases given (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, `func_1(4) == 800`) are consistent with the logic implemented in the function. 

- For `n=2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64]`. The sum is `8 + 64 = 72`.
- For `n=3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
- For `n=4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

The function generates the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension and then calculates the sum of their cubes. Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound, the program is correct for the given problem description.
