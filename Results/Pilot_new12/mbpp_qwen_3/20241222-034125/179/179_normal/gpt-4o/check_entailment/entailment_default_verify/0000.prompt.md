You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions given in the program itself serve as test cases:

- For `func_1(2)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64]`. The sum is `72`, which matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(3)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`. The sum is `288`, which matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(4)`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, and their cubes are `[8, 64, 216, 512]`. The sum is `800`, which matches the assertion.

The program uses list comprehension to generate the even numbers and a generator expression to compute their cubes before summing them up. This approach ensures that the cube sum is calculated accurately for the first `n` even natural numbers. Since all provided test cases are satisfied and no edge cases contradict the program's logic, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers. The computation is based on the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The function returns the computed value `cube_sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not handle negative integers or non-integer values for `n`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
