Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: 
   - The function should take a positive integer `n` as input.
   - It should find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes one parameter `n`.
   - A list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates the first `n` even natural numbers (i.e., `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2n]`).
   - Another list comprehension `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers.
   - The function returns `cube_sum`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The assertions in the program validate the function for specific cases:
     - `assert func_1(2) == 72` (Expected: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\))
     - `assert func_1(3) == 288` (Expected: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\))
     - `assert func_1(4) == 800` (Expected: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\))

The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. It matches the problem description and passes the provided test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
