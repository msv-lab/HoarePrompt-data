Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The code uses a list comprehension to generate the first `n` even numbers and then calculates their cubes using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The function then returns the computed value.

The problem description asks for a function that finds the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided in the code verify that the function works correctly for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, yielding the results 72, 288, and 800 respectively. These results match the expected outcomes based on the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\).

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to handle the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not include checks for negative integers or non-integer values, which aligns with the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, and the examples provided suggest that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case described.
