Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and computes the sum of cubes using the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The provided test cases (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, `func_1(4) == 800`) align with this logic and validate the function's correctness. Since the program meets the problem description and there are no issues identified based on the output hints, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
