Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer `n` as input. It does not explicitly handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, but as per the assumption, we are considering valid inputs.

2. **Even Numbers Generation**: It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `[(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`.

3. **Cube Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of cubes of these even numbers using the expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`, which is mathematically correct.

4. **Formula Compliance**: The calculated sum of cubes is consistent with the expected formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\), as derived from the properties of the sequence of even numbers.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed value `cube_sum`, which is the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and correctly performs the required computation for any valid positive integer input, the program is correct.
