#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to 2n^2(n+1)^2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers. The computation is based on the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The function returns the computed value `cube_sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not handle negative integers or non-integer values for `n`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
