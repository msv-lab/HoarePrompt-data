The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers. The computation is based on the formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The function returns the computed value `cube_sum`. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and does not handle negative integers or non-integer values for `n`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
