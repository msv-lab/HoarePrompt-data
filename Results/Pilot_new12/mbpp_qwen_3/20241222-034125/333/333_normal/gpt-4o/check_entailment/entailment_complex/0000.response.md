Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression with parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced or not. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The function expects a string `expr` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). While the problem description doesn't explicitly mention input validation, the function correctly processes the input as expected, and the assumptions about valid inputs are consistent with the provided assertions.

2. **Stack Usage**: The function uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. For each character in the expression, it checks whether the character is an opening bracket (pushes it onto the stack) or a closing bracket (checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket). If at any point the stack is empty and a closing bracket is encountered, or if the stack's top element does not match the corresponding opening bracket, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening brackets have been correctly matched with their corresponding closing brackets, hence the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `False`.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions (`assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True`, `assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False`, `assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True`) cover various scenarios including a balanced expression, an unbalanced expression with a mismatched closing bracket, and a more complex balanced expression. These assertions confirm that the function behaves as intended across different cases.

Given that the function accurately implements the logic to verify the balance of the given expression and the provided assertions validate its correctness, the program meets the problem description and is therefore correct.
