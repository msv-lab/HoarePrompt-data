Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses a stack to verify if the given expression is balanced. The logic covers all necessary cases, including nested and sequential pairs of brackets, as evidenced by the provided test cases and the output hints. The function correctly returns `True` for balanced expressions and `False` for unbalanced ones. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
