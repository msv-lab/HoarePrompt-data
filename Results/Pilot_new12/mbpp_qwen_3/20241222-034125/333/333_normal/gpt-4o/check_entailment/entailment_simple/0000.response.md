Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program implements a function `func_1` that checks whether a given expression with parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) is balanced or not. The function works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: A stack is initialized to keep track of opening brackets.
2. **Matching Pairs Dictionary**: A dictionary `matching_pairs` is used to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3. **Iterating Through Expression**: For each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., one of the values in `matching_pairs`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., one of the keys in `matching_pairs`):
     - The function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, the expression is unbalanced, and the function returns `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After iterating through the entire expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets were properly closed, and the expression is balanced, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the stack contains unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

The program follows the problem description accurately because:
- It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
- It correctly matches each type of bracket and ensures they are nested correctly.
- It handles both cases where the expression is balanced and unbalanced.
- It returns `True` for balanced expressions and `False` for unbalanced expressions.

Given these points, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
