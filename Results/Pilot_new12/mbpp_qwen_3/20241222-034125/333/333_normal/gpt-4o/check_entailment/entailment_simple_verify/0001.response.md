Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_1` only processes the given expression as a single string and does not handle consecutive balanced expressions correctly. The annotation indicates that after processing the first balanced sub-expression `{}`, the stack becomes empty, and subsequent checks for balanced sub-expressions like `[]` and `()` will fail because the stack is already empty. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return `False` for inputs like `'{()}[{}][]({})'`.

The provided code does not modify the stack to handle consecutive balanced expressions correctly. Hence, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not meet the problem description.
