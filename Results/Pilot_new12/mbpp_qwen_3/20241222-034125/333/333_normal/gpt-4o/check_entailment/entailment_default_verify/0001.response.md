Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle consecutive balanced expressions as expected. According to the output hints, the function should process each balanced sub-expression independently and return `True` only if all sub-expressions are correctly matched. However, the current implementation will return `False` for a string like `'{()}[{}][]({})'` because it empties the stack after processing the first balanced sub-expression `{}`. Therefore, the function does not correctly handle consecutive balanced expressions, which contradicts the problem description and the expected behavior based on the output hints.
