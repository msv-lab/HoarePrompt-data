Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. It handles all the common edge cases such as empty strings, single-character strings, and nested or sequential pairs of brackets. The function uses a dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets and iterates through each character in the expression. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`. After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty, which would indicate that all brackets were properly matched. Since the provided examples and the logic within the function cover all necessary cases, the function works correctly for the described problem.
