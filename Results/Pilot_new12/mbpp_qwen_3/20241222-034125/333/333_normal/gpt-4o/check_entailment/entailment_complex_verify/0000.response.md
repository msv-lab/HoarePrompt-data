Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. The function handles all the common edge cases, as evidenced by the provided assertions. The annotations clearly state that if the stack is empty after processing all characters, it indicates all brackets were properly matched, and otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets, leading to a return value of `False`. This aligns with the problem description of checking if the expression is balanced. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
