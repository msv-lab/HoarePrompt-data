Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if the given expression is balanced. It uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets and ensures that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order. The examples provided in the output hints are handled correctly by the code:

- `{()}[{}]` is balanced, so the function returns `True`.
- `{()}[{]` is unbalanced because the closing square bracket does not match the last opening square bracket, so the function returns `False`.
- `{()}[{}][]({})` is balanced, so the function returns `True`.

Since the code handles all the provided examples and the logic seems sound, it can be concluded that the code works correctly for every potential case within the constraints of the problem description.
