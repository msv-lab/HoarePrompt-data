The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It checks if all the opening brackets in `expr` have correctly matched closing brackets. The function uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes cases where there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, indicating incorrect matching, and thus returning `False`.
