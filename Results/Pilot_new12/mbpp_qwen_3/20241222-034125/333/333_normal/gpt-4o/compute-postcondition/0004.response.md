The code appends the current character `char` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state where `stack` is an empty list `[]`, after appending `char`, the `stack` list will contain the character `char`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list containing `[char]`, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
