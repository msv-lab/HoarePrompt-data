Postcondition: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list [], and `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. The character `char` is in the values of `matching_pairs`. The stack is either not empty or the popped element from the stack is equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char` in `matching_pairs`**
