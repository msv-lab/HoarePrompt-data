Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is a closing bracket, `char` is added to `stack` and the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket in `matching_pairs`. If the condition is satisfied, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything. If `char` is not a closing bracket, `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and the function continues without returning anything.***
