Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list, and `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the stack is either not empty or the popped element from the stack is equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char` in `matching_pairs`. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.***
