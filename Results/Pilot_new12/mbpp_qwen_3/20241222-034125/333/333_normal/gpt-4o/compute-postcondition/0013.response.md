The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `char`, we will keep it as `char` in the output state.

Therefore, the output state is: `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is the original stack with `char` appended, and `matching_pairs` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is the original stack with `char` appended, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
