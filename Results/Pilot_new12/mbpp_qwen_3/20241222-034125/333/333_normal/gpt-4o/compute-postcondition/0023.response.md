Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces (excluding the last character), `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and `matching_pairs` remains the same. If `char` is found in `matching_pairs.values()`, `stack` is appended with `char`. Otherwise, the function returns False if the stack is empty or if the popped element does not match the corresponding closing character in `matching_pairs`. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a specific value.***
