Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - `stack` is a list.
   - `matching_pairs` is a dictionary where `')': '(', ']': '[`, and `'}': '{`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `expr`. For each `char`:
   - If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the stack is either not empty or the top element of the stack (popped from the stack) matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char`.
   - If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**: We need to determine the state of `expr`, `stack`, and `matching_pairs` at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop continues based on the characters in `expr`, we need to consider the next character in the string.

Given these points, let's adjust the states step by step:

- **Character to Process**: At the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character `char` in the string `expr`.
- **Stack State**: The stack can either remain unchanged or be modified based on the current character `char`. However, since we don't know the exact modification, we'll assume it could be either way.
- **Matching Pairs**: The dictionary `matching_pairs` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `expr` is the same non-empty string, but now considering the next character.
- `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, but its exact state is not specified without the actual character `char`.
- `matching_pairs` remains the same.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
