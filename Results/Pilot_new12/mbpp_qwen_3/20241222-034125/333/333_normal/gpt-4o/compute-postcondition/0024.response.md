Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or a list containing the unmatched opening brackets, and `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `expr` contains all correctly matched pairs, `stack` will be an empty list after the loop completes. If there are any unmatched closing brackets in `expr`, `stack` will contain the corresponding unmatched opening brackets.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each character in `expr`.
- If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `[`, or `{`), it is checked against the top of the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the corresponding opening bracket is popped from the stack.
- If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, or `{`), it is simply appended to the stack.
- After the loop completes, if all brackets are correctly matched, the stack will be empty. If there are any unmatched closing brackets, the stack will contain the corresponding unmatched opening brackets.

This output state captures the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations, considering both cases where the loop completes successfully and where it may fail due to unmatched closing brackets.
