The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the list `stack`. Since `char` is not defined in the initial state, we can denote it as `char` in the output state.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces (excluding the last character), `stack` is a list with one additional element `char`, and `matching_pairs` remains the same.**
