Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It checks if all the opening brackets in `expr` have correctly matched closing brackets. The function uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes cases where there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, indicating incorrect matching, and thus returning `False`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles strings containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- It correctly identifies and matches each type of bracket with its corresponding pair.
- Potential edge cases include empty strings (`""`), strings with only one type of bracket, and strings with mismatched brackets.
- The function does not handle other characters apart from the specified brackets, ensuring it only processes the intended characters.
- There is no explicit handling for malformed input types (e.g., non-string inputs). However, since the function expects a string, it implicitly assumes the input is valid and formatted correctly.
