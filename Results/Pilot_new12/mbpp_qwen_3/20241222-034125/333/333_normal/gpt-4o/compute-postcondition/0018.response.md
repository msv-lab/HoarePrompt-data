According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char`. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `expr`. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and `matching_pairs` remains the same.

If `char` is a closing bracket, it is added to `stack` and the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket in `matching_pairs`. If this condition is satisfied, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything. If `char` is not a closing bracket, `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and the function continues without returning anything.

Since the loop continues as long as there are characters left in `expr`, the next character in `expr` will be the next element to process. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `expr` now consists of all remaining characters except the last one processed, and `stack` could be either unchanged or modified based on the processing of the last character.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces (excluding the last character), `stack` could be either unchanged or modified, and `matching_pairs` remains the same**.
