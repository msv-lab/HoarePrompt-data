The code initializes an empty list named `stack`. The variable `expr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `stack` and the unchanged value of `expr`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'); `stack` is an empty list []**
