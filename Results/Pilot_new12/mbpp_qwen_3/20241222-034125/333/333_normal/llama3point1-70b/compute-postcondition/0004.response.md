The code `stack.append(char)` appends the current character `char` to the list `stack`. Since `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, it means `char` is one of the keys in the dictionary, and its corresponding value (which is another bracket) will be added to the stack.

The initial state is: `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is `{'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}`, `expression` must be a non-empty string, and the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary.

After executing `stack.append(char)`, the stack will contain the current character `char`.

Output State: **`stack` is ['char'], `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `expression` must be a non-empty string, the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary**
