Postcondition: **`stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']',}, `expression` is a non-empty string, and no character in `expression` is a key in `brackets`. The current character from the `expression` is in the values of `brackets`, and either the stack is not empty or the last character of `stack` matches with the current character from `expression`**
