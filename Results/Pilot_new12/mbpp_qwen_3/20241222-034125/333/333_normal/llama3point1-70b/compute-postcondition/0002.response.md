According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expression`. The loop will execute if `expression` is a non-empty string containing characters that include brackets.

Before the loop starts, the state is as follows:
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `brackets` is a dictionary containing matching pairs of brackets.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check `expression`:** The loop will only execute if `expression` is not empty. If `expression` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **Initial state of `stack` and `brackets`:** These remain unchanged as they do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `expression` is a non-empty string.

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `expression` must be a non-empty string**
