Postcondition: **`stack` is a list. If the next character `char` is found in `brackets`, `stack` is updated by appending `char`. If `char` is not found in `brackets`, `stack` remains unchanged. The function returns False if the next character in `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket for `char` (based on the `brackets` dictionary). Otherwise, the top character of `stack` remains unchanged.**
