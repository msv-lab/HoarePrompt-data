Postcondition: ***`stack` is a list. If the next character `char` is found in `brackets.values()` and the popped character from `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket for `char` (based on the `brackets` dictionary), the function returns False. Otherwise, the top character of `stack` remains unchanged.***
