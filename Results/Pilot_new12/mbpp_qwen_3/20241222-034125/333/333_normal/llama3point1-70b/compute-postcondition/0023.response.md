Postcondition: ***`stack` contains its previous contents plus the new `char` if `char` is an opening bracket, or it remains unchanged if the top of `stack` matches `char` (in which case the top is popped); otherwise, `stack` becomes empty. The function returns `False` if the top of `stack` does not match `char`, indicating an unmatched closing bracket. Otherwise, the function does nothing and `stack` remains as updated.***
