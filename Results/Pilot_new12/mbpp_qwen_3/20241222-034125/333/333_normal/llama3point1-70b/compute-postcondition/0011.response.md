Postcondition: ***`stack` is a list where, if the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` will contain `char`. Otherwise, `stack` remains empty. `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `expression` is a non-empty string. If the current character is in the `brackets` keys, `stack` will contain this character. If the current character is in the `brackets` values and the stack is not empty or the last element of `stack` matches the current character from `expression`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the stack remains unchanged.***
