To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and how the `stack` and `char` variables are updated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `stack` is a list.
   - `char` is the current character from the `expression`.
   - `brackets` is a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - If `char` is found in `brackets`, it means `char` is an opening bracket.
     - In this case, `char` is appended to `stack`.
   - If `char` is not found in `brackets`, it means `char` is either a closing bracket or some other character.
     - In this case, the loop checks if the top of `stack` matches the corresponding closing bracket for `char`.
       - If it does not match, the function returns `False` and the loop terminates.
       - If it matches, the top element of `stack` is removed (popped).

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `stack` is a list.
   - The current `char` is the next character to be processed.

4. **Determine Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `char` must be either an opening bracket (which gets appended to `stack`) or a closing bracket that matches the top of `stack`.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration, the state will depend on whether the next `char` is an opening bracket or a closing bracket. If it's an opening bracket, it will be appended to `stack`. If it's a closing bracket, the top of `stack` will be checked and possibly removed.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact value of `char` or the contents of `stack`, the general state for the next iteration would be:

- `stack` will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration, unless the next `char` is an opening bracket, in which case it will be appended.
- `char` will be the next character from the `expression`.

Since the exact `char` is not specified, we can only state the general condition.

### Final Answer:

State: **`stack` is a list, `char` is the next character from the `expression`**.

This indicates that the loop will continue based on the next character from the `expression`, and the `stack` will be updated accordingly.
