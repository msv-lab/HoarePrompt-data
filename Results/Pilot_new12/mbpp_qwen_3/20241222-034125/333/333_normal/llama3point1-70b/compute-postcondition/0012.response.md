To understand the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string. Based on the given conditions, the `stack` list will only be modified when the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary keys (i.e., an opening bracket), or when the current character is a closing bracket and matches the last element of the `stack`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The `stack` contains characters from `brackets` dictionary keys if the current character `char` matches one of those keys.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each character `char` in `expression`:
   - If `char` is in `brackets.keys()`, the `stack` will contain `char`.
   - If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and the `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` matches the current character from `expression`, then the condition holds, and the `stack` is left unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `stack` is a list where, if the current character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` will contain `char`.
- `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.
- `expression` is a non-empty string.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `stack` contains characters based on the conditions described above.
- The current character `char` has been processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character from `expression` must be processed. The `stack` state will depend on whether the next character is an opening or closing bracket.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **If the Next Character is an Opening Bracket**:
   - The `stack` will contain this new character.
   
2. **If the Next Character is a Closing Bracket**:
   - The `stack` will be checked if it is not empty and the last element matches the closing bracket.
   - If it matches, the `stack` remains unchanged; otherwise, it is popped.

Since the exact character for the next iteration is not specified, we can generalize the state as follows:

- The `stack` will either contain the next opening bracket or remain unchanged if the next character is a closing bracket that matches the last element of the `stack`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `stack` is a list where, if the next character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` will contain this new character.
- The `expression` string has been partially processed, and the next character will be checked against the `brackets` dictionary.

### Final Answer:
State: **`stack` is a list where, if the next character `char` is in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` will contain this new character, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `expression` is a non-empty string.**
