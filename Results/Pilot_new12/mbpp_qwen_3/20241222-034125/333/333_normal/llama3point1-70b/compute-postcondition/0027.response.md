Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the string are correctly matched.**

- **Input:** The function takes a single parameter `expression`, which is a string consisting of balanced or unbalanced brackets.
- **Process:**
  - The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.
  - For each character in the `expression`:
    - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
    - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
  - After processing all characters in the `expression`, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all brackets were correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
- **Output:**
  - The function returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating that all brackets in the `expression` are correctly matched.
  - The function returns `False` if the stack is not empty, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.

**Edge Cases:**
- An empty string `expression` will result in an empty stack, and the function will return `True` because there are no brackets to check.
- A string with only opening brackets (e.g., `"[[]{}]"`) will result in a non-empty stack, and the function will return `False`.
- A string with only closing brackets (e.g., `"]][}"`) will result in an empty stack initially, but the function will eventually return `False` because there are no opening brackets to match.
- A string with mixed but unbalanced brackets (e.g., `"({})["`) will result in a non-empty stack, and the function will return `False`.

**Summary of Actions:**
- The function processes each character in the `expression`.
- It maintains a stack to track the opening brackets.
- It ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket.
- The final state of the function is determined by whether the stack is empty after processing the entire `expression`.
