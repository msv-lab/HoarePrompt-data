The code `stack.append(char)` appends the current `char` to the `stack`. Given the initial conditions where `char` must be either an opening or a closing bracket, and the stack contains the appropriate brackets up to the last processed `char`, appending `char` will modify the `stack` but not affect `char` itself. 

Therefore, the `stack` will contain its previous contents plus the new `char` that was just appended. The `char` remains unchanged as the next character from the `expression`.

Output State: **`stack` contains its previous contents plus the new `char` that was appended; `char` is the next character from the `expression`.**
