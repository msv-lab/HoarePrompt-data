The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the list `stack`. Since `char` is checked against the `brackets` dictionary in the initial state, it means `char` is one of the keys in the `brackets` dictionary, which are `('(', '{', '[')`. This operation does not affect the `brackets` dictionary or the `expression` string.

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated state is:

- `stack` now contains the value of `char` (which is either `(`, `{`, or `[')`) appended to its existing elements.
- `brackets` remains unchanged.
- `expression` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` is a list containing its previous elements plus `char`; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}; `expression` is a non-empty string**
