You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `stack` is an empty list.
    #- `brackets` is a dictionary containing `{'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}`.
    #- `expression` is a non-empty string.
    #
    #### Loop Code
    #```python
    #for char in expression:
    #    if char in brackets:
    #        stack.append(char)
    #    elif char in brackets.values():
    #        if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
    #            return False
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis
    #
    #1. **First Iteration**:
    #   - If `char` is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), it gets appended to `stack`.
    #   - If `char` is a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), it checks if `stack` is empty or if the last element of `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition fails, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - The process continues as described above. If an opening bracket is found, it gets appended to `stack`.
    #   - If a closing bracket is found, it checks if the top of `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it doesn't match, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - This pattern continues. If an opening bracket is found, it gets appended to `stack`.
    #   - If a closing bracket is found, it checks if the top of `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it doesn't match, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #4. **General Iteration**:
    #   - Each iteration appends an opening bracket to `stack` if found in `brackets`.
    #   - Each iteration pops the top element of `stack` and checks if it matches the current closing bracket. If they don't match, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #5. **Final State**:
    #   - After all iterations, if there are no mismatches and the `stack` is empty, the function returns `True`.
    #   - If there are mismatches or the `stack` is not empty, the function returns `False`.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- `stack` will be empty if and only if the `expression` is a valid sequence of matching brackets. If the `expression` contains any mismatched brackets or unbalanced sequences, the `stack` will not be empty.
    #- `brackets` remains unchanged as it is a dictionary defined in the initial state.
    #- The function returns `True` if the `stack` is empty at the end, indicating all brackets are correctly matched. It returns `False` otherwise.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `stack` is empty if and only if the `expression` is a valid sequence of matching brackets. Otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets.
    #- `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.
    #- The function returns `True` if the `stack` is empty, and `False` otherwise.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets are correctly matched) and False if the stack is not empty (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets). Brackets remain as {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
#
#The function returns:
#- Case_1: `False`
#- Case_2: `False`
#- Case_3: `False`
#- Case_4: `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets are correctly matched) and `False` if the stack is not empty (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets).
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` and return `True` if all brackets in the string are correctly matched, otherwise return `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns False

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns True if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets are correctly matched) and False if the stack is not empty (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets). Brackets remain as {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
