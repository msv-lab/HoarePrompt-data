Postcondition: **`stack` remains unchanged if the top of `stack` matches `char`, otherwise `stack` becomes empty. The function returns False if the condition inside the if statement is true; otherwise, it does nothing.** 

Explanation: The if condition checks if the top of `stack` (the last appended opening bracket) does not match the current `char`. If they do not match, the stack is emptied (`stack` becomes empty), and the function returns `False`. If they match, the top element of `stack` is popped, but `stack` remains unchanged, and the function does not return anything (effectively continuing the loop).
