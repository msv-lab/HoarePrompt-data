Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to check if the given expression is balanced or not with respect to the following characters: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. 

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A stack is initialized to keep track of opening brackets.
   - A dictionary `brackets` is used to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.

2. **Loop through the Expression:**
   - For each character in the expression:
     - If the character is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If the character is a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), it checks whether the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all characters in the expression, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had a corresponding closing bracket and were properly matched. Hence, the function returns `True`.
   - If the stack is not empty, it indicates that there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

#### Problem Description Compliance:

- The function correctly handles all types of brackets mentioned in the problem description.
- It checks for both opening and closing brackets in a sequential manner.
- The use of a stack ensures that the order of brackets is maintained and that each opening bracket is properly closed in the correct order.
- The function returns `True` only if all brackets are correctly matched and `False` if there are any mismatches or unbalanced sequences.

Since the function `func_1` follows the logic required to validate the balance of different types of brackets as per the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
