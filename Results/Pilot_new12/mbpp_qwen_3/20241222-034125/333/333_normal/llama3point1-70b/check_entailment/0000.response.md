Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has the corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. 

- If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty (which would mean there's no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
- After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

Since the function handles all possible cases correctly, it meets the problem description for every potential case.
