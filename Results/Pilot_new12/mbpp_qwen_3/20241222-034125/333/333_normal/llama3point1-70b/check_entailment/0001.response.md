Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the parentheses `()`, braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`. It uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has the corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function handles all potential cases where the expression is balanced or unbalanced, including edge cases such as empty strings and expressions with only opening or closing brackets. Since the function correctly implements the logic for checking balanced expressions, it meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
