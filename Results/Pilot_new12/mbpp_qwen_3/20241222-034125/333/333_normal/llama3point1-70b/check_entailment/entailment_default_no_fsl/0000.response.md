Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to keep track of opening brackets. It ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. The code handles all potential cases for the given problem description, including nested and consecutive brackets. The logic correctly returns `False` if there is a mismatch or if there are leftover unmatched opening brackets in the stack after processing the entire expression. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
