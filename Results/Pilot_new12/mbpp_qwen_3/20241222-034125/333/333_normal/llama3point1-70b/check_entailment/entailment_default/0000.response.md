Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if the given expression is balanced by using a stack to match opening and closing brackets. The function iterates through each character in the expression. If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were correctly matched, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as expected. The function correctly identifies whether the expression is balanced by ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. There are no examples or hints provided that suggest the code does not work correctly for any potential case.
