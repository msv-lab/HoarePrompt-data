Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the provided Python function `func_1`. The function uses a stack to verify that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of checking if an expression is balanced. The output hints further confirm that the function processes strings containing only specific types of brackets and returns a boolean indicating the balance of these brackets. Since the function correctly implements this logic without any issues as per the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of its correctness is accurate.
