Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Empty List Check**: The function first checks if the list is empty using the condition `if (not lst)`. If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting and Consecutive Check**: For non-empty lists, the function sorts the list (`lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`) and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This ensures that the list contains consecutive numbers.

3. **Return Statements**: 
   - If any pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list does not have a difference of 1, the function returns `False`.
   - If all pairs of consecutive elements have a difference of 1, the function returns `True`.

The function correctly handles all edge cases:
- It returns `False` for an empty list.
- It returns `False` if the list does not contain consecutive numbers.
- It returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function `func_1` consistently performs the required task of checking for consecutive numbers in the list. Therefore, the program is correct.
