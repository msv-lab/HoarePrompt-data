Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function handles the case where the list is empty by returning `False`. It sorts the list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list is exactly 1. The provided test cases and the explanation in the output hints confirm that the function works as expected for the given scenarios. There are no contradictions or omissions in the provided code that would render it incorrect based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
