Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It handles the case where the list is empty by returning `False`. For non-empty lists, it sorts the list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This approach ensures that the list contains consecutive numbers if and only if the sorted list meets the condition. The examples provided in the problem description also confirm that the function works as expected for both consecutive and non-consecutive lists. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
