Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and checks if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1. The examples given also correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because there is a gap between 3 and 5.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the sequence is not in order and has a repetition, but the function checks for strict consecutiveness.

Since the function handles all the provided cases and the logic seems sound, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description.
