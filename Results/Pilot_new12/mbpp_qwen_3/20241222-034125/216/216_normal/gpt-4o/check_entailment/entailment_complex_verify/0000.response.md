Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotated version supports this by detailing the state of the program at different stages and confirming that the logic is sound. Specifically:

1. The function correctly returns `False` if the input list is empty.
2. After sorting the list, the function checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the function completes the loop without returning `False`, it means all pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list have a difference of 1, and thus it returns `True`.

The annotated version reinforces that the function handles all edge cases and the provided test cases demonstrate its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
