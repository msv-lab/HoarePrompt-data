Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The program first checks if the list is empty using the condition `if (not lst)`. If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting and Comparison**: For non-empty lists, the program sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This ensures that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Return Statements**: 
   - If at any point the difference between two consecutive elements is not 1, the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

Given the provided test cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` is correct because the list contains consecutive numbers.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False` is correct because the list does not contain consecutive numbers (there is a gap between 3 and 5).
- `func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False` is correct because the list does not contain consecutive numbers (it has a duplicate and a gap).

Since the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement, it is correct.
