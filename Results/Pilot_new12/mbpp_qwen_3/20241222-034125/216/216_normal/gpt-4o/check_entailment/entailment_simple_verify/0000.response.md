Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers. The logic is sound and the function behaves as expected based on the provided test cases. Specifically:
- When the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- When the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, the function returns `False` because there is a gap between 3 and 5.
- When the input list is `[1, 2, 1]`, the function returns `False` because the sequence is not in order and the function checks for strict consecutiveness.

The annotated version supports the correctness of the program, and there are no contradictions or issues with the logic presented. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
