Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function `func_1` first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If this condition is met for all pairs, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected:
- It returns `False` if the list is empty.
- It returns `True` if the list contains consecutive numbers.
- It returns `False` if the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

Given the assertions and the output hints, the code handles all potential cases correctly and meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
