Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function handles various edge cases, including an empty list, lists with duplicates, and lists with missing consecutive numbers. The annotated version of the code provides clear states and transitions within the function, which align with the expected behavior. The function returns `False` when the list is empty or when there are gaps between consecutive numbers, and it returns `True` only when the list contains consecutive numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
