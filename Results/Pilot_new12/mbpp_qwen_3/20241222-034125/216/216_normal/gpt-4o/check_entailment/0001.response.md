Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each element is consecutive to the next one. The function works correctly for the given test cases and seems to handle all potential edge cases, such as an empty list, lists with duplicates, and lists with missing consecutive numbers. There doesn't appear to be any logical flaw or missing edge case that would cause the function to fail for any valid input.
