Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotations support this by indicating that the function properly handles an empty list, sorts the input list, and checks the consecutive differences correctly. The function does not modify the original list but creates a sorted copy, which is a reasonable approach. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
