#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty

    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements, and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, it returns `False`. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list is exactly 1. If this condition is met for all pairs, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the original list `lst` but creates a sorted copy `lst_sorted`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all potential cases are covered by the return statements.
