Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers (not empty).
   - `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The difference between the first two elements of `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` must still hold true.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` should be adjusted to `1`.
   - `lst_sorted` must still be a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between the first two elements of `lst_sorted` must still be equal to 1.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 1.
- `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements.
- The difference between the first two elements of `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the difference between the first two elements of `lst_sorted` is equal to 1**
