According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the condition for continuing the loop is that the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` must be equal to 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
- `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 2 elements.
- If the difference between the consecutive elements at indices `i` and `i+1` in `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
- Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider:
1. The current value of `i` (which would be `len(lst_sorted) - 2` if the loop just finished).
2. The condition for the next iteration: the difference between `lst_sorted[i+1]` and `lst_sorted[i+2]` must be equal to 1.

Since the loop just finished, `i` was `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will now be `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.
- The condition for the next iteration is that the difference between `lst_sorted[len(lst_sorted) - 1]` and `lst_sorted[len(lst_sorted) - 2]` must be equal to 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 3 elements, the difference between the consecutive elements at indices `len(lst_sorted) - 2` and `len(lst_sorted) - 1` in `lst_sorted` must be equal to 1, and `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 1`**.
