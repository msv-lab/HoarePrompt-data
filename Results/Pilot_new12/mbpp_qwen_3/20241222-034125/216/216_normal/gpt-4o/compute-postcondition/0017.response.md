Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, it returns `False`. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list is exactly 1. If this condition is met for all pairs, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the original list `lst` but creates a sorted copy `lst_sorted`. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and all potential cases are covered by the return statements.**

Edge Cases:
- If the list contains fewer than two elements, the function returns `False` because the `for` loop cannot execute.
- If the list contains exactly two elements and their difference is 1, the function returns `True`.
- If the list contains more than two elements, the function returns `True` only if the difference between every consecutive pair is exactly 1.
