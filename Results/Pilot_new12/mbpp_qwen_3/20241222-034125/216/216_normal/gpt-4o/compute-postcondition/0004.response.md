State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop is iterating over `range(len(lst_sorted) - 1)`, which means the loop will run as long as `len(lst_sorted) > 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements. If `lst_sorted` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute because `len(lst_sorted) - 1` would be less than 0, making the range function return an empty sequence.

Given this, we need to ensure that `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements. Since `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`, if `lst` has at least 2 unique elements, `lst_sorted` will have at least 2 elements.

3. Additionally, the loop variable `i` should start from 0, as the loop will iterate through each element of `lst_sorted` except the last one.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Final answer:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
