The `sorted(lst)` function sorts the list `lst` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to `lst_sorted`. Since `lst` is not empty, `lst_sorted` will be a sorted version of `lst`, but `lst` itself remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers (not empty), `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`**
