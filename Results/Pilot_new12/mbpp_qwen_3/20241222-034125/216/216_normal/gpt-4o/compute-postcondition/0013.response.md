Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` with at least 3 elements. If the difference between the consecutive elements at indices `len(lst_sorted) - 2` and `len(lst_sorted) - 1` in `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
