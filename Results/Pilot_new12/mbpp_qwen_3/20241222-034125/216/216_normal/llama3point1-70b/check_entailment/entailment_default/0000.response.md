Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates. The function first sorts the list, then checks if each element is exactly one more than the previous element using the `all` function with a generator expression. Additionally, it verifies that the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`.

This approach handles the following edge cases:
- An empty list `[]` would return `False` because there are no elements to form a sequence.
- A list with a single element `[x]` would return `False` unless the list contains only one unique element.
- The function assumes the input is a list of integers, which is reasonable given the problem description.

Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the code correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates for every potential case.
