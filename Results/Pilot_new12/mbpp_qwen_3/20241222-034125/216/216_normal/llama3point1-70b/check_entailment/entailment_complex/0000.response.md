Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input, which aligns with the problem statement requiring a list of integers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list using `lst.sort()`. Sorting is a necessary step to ensure that the list can be checked for consecutive numbers correctly.

3. **Checking Consecutive Numbers and Uniqueness**:
   - The first condition checks if each element in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous element: `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))`.
   - The second condition checks if the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements in the list: `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. This ensures there are no duplicate elements.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied, and `False` otherwise.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Empty List**: Both conditions would fail, and the function returns `False`.
- **Single Element List**: If the list has a single element, the length condition fails unless the element is repeated, in which case the uniqueness condition fails.
- **Non-Integer Values**: While the problem description does not explicitly handle non-integer values, the function relies on the assumption that the input is a list of integers. If non-integers are present, the `sort()` method might raise an error, but the problem statement assumes valid inputs.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to check for consecutive numbers without duplicates, as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
