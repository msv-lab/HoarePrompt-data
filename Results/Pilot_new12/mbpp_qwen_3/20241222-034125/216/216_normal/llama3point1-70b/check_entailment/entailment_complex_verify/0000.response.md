Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates. It sorts the list and then verifies two conditions: (1) that each element is exactly one more than the previous element, ensuring the sequence is consecutive; and (2) that the length of the list matches the number of unique elements, ensuring there are no duplicates. The annotated version aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, and there are no evident edge cases that would make the function incorrect under the given constraints.
