You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then uses a generator expression with the `all()` function to verify that each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique (consecutive numbers cannot repeat). This approach correctly handles all potential cases where the list might contain consecutive numbers, including lists with duplicate values, non-integer values, and unsorted lists. Since the function correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers regardless of the initial order or presence of duplicates, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if the list is a consecutive sequence without any duplicates and the length of the list matches the number of unique elements. Specifically, the function first sorts the list `lst`. Then, it checks two conditions: (1) whether each element in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous element, ensuring the sequence is consecutive; and (2) whether the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements in the list, ensuring there are no duplicates. If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list (`[]`) would return `False` because there are no elements to form a sequence.
- A list with a single element `[x]` would also return `False` unless the list contains only one unique element.
- The function assumes the input is a list of integers. If the input contains non-integer values, the function may behave unexpectedly or raise an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
