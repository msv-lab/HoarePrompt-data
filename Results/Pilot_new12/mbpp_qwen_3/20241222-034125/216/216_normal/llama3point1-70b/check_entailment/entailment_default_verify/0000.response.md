Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly evaluates the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` indeed checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates. It sorts the list and then verifies that each element is exactly one more than the previous element, ensuring the sequence is consecutive. Additionally, it checks that the length of the list matches the number of unique elements, confirming there are no duplicates. The output hints further clarify that the function handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description.
