Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then uses a generator expression with the `all()` function to verify that each element is exactly one greater than the previous element. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique (consecutive numbers cannot repeat). This approach correctly handles all potential cases where the list might contain consecutive numbers, including lists with duplicate values, non-integer values, and unsorted lists. Since the function correctly identifies whether the list contains consecutive numbers regardless of the initial order or presence of duplicates, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
