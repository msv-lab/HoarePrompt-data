Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` returns `True` if the list `lst` is a consecutive sequence without any duplicates and the length of the list matches the number of unique elements in the list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires checking whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The provided function achieves this by sorting the list and then checking the differences between consecutive elements to ensure they are all 1, and ensuring there are no duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set of the list. Since the annotations and the original assessment both confirm the function's correctness in meeting the problem description, the original assessment remains valid.
