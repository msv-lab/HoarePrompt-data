Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates. The annotated version confirms that the function first sorts the list and then verifies two conditions: (1) whether each element is exactly one greater than the previous element, ensuring the sequence is consecutive, and (2) whether the length of the list matches the number of unique elements, ensuring there are no duplicates. 

The function handles various edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists appropriately by returning `False`. The assumption that the input is a list of integers is valid under the problem description, which focuses on checking for consecutive numbers in an integer list. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is correct.
