Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the List**: The line `lst.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order. This step is necessary to ensure that consecutive numbers are adjacent in the sorted list.
   
2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**: The expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if each element in the sorted list is exactly one greater than its preceding element. This ensures that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The expression `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list. This ensures that there are no duplicate elements in the list.

By combining these two checks, the function ensures that the list is both a sequence of consecutive numbers and contains no duplicates. Thus, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
