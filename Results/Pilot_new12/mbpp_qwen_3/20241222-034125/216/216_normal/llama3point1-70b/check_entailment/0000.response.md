Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements in the list, which is necessary for the numbers to be consecutive. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including handling duplicates and ensuring the sequence is uninterrupted. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that this function would fail for, making it correct according to the problem description.
