Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. However, upon closer inspection and based on the provided output hints, the function has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. The function correctly checks for consecutive numbers and uniqueness but fails to handle the case where the list contains a single element. If the list has a single element, the function should return `True` if that element is a standalone number (i.e., no duplicates), but the current implementation returns `False` for such cases. For example, `func_1([5])` should return `True`, but it returns `False`.

2. The function assumes that the input is a list of integers. If the list contains non-integer values, it may raise a `TypeError` due to the subtraction operation `lst[i] - lst[i - 1]`. The function does not handle this case gracefully, which means it does not meet the problem description's requirements.

Given these points, the function does not fully meet the problem description and the original assessment needs to be revised. Therefore, the final assessment is `False`.
