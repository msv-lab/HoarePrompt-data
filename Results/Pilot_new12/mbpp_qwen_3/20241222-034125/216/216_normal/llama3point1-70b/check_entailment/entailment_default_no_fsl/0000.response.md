Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when the input list contains a single element. According to the problem description, a list with a single element should return `True` if the list contains only one unique element, which means the list is trivially "consecutive" in the sense that it has no duplicates and its length equals the number of unique elements. However, the current implementation checks if the length of the list equals the number of unique elements using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`, which is unnecessary and does not cover this edge case. Instead, the condition should directly check if the list has more than one element and then proceed with the rest of the logic. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
