#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. The function performs this operation by using the built-in `count` method of strings, which counts the number of times a specified value (in this case, 'std') appears in the string. This method works for any string input, including empty strings, where the count would be 0. If the substring 'std' is not present in the string `s`, the function will return 0.
