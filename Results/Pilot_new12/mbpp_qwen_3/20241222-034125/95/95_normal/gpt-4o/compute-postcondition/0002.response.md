Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. The function performs this operation by using the built-in `count` method of strings, which counts the number of times a specified value (in this case, 'std') appears in the string. This method works for any string input, including empty strings, where the count would be 0. If the substring 'std' is not present in the string `s`, the function will return 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string `s` is empty, the function correctly returns 0.
- If the substring 'std' is not present in the string `s`, the function correctly returns 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code. The code accurately implements the described functionality without any omissions.
