Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of strings, which accurately counts how many times the substring 'std' appears in the given string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', a single occurrence, no occurrences, and an empty string, all of which the function handles correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
