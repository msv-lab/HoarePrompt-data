Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. All the test cases provided in the output hints and additional test cases (e.g., handling of empty strings and substrings not present in the string) are handled correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
