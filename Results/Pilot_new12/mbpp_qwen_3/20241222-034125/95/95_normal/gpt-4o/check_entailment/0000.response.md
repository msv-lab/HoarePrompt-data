Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std'. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases where the substring 'std' appears in the input string. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and different placements of the substring 'std', and the function passes all of them. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
