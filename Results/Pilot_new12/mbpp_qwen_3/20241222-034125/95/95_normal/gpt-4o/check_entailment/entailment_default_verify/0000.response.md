Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std'. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including empty strings and different placements of the substring 'std', and the function passes all of them. The output hints confirm that the function correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in any given string, making the original assessment correct.
