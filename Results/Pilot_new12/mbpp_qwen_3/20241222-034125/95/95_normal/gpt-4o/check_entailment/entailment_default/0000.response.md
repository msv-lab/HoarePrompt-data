Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings, which accurately counts how many times the substring 'std' appears in the input string `s`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', a single occurrence, no occurrences, and an empty string. The function handles all these cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
