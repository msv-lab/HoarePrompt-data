Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The test cases provided in the assertions correctly validate this behavior:

- `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd')` returns `3`, which is the number of times 'std' appears in the string.
- `func_1('truststdsolensporsd')` returns `1`, indicating one occurrence of 'std'.
- `func_1('makestdsostdworthit')` returns `2`, showing two occurrences of 'std'.
- `func_1('stds')` returns `1`, indicating one occurrence of 'std'.
- `func_1('')` returns `0`, indicating no occurrences of 'std' in an empty string.

Since the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` for all provided test cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
