Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This is exactly what the problem description specifies. The use of the `count` method ensures that the function correctly counts the substrings. Additionally, the function handles the case where `s` is an empty string by returning 0, which aligns with the expected behavior. There are no edge cases or functionalities missing that would make the program incorrect according to the given problem description.
