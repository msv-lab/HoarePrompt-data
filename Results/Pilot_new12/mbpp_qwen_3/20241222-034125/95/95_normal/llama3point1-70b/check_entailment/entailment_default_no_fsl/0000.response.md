Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the `count` method. The function handles the case where `s` is an empty string by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description. Since the code is implemented as expected and there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
