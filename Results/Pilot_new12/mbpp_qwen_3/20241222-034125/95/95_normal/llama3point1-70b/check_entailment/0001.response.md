Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. Since the problem description asks for counting the occurrences of the exact substring 'std', and the function does exactly that, it meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
