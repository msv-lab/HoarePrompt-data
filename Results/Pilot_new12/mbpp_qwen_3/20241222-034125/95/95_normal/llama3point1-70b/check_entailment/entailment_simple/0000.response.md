Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This directly aligns with the problem statement, which asks to write a function to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The use of the `count` method of the string object correctly implements this functionality without any additional conditions or errors under the given assumptions about valid input.
