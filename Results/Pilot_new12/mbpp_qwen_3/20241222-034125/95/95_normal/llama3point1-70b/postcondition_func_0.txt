The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the number of times the substring 'std' appears in `s`. It does this by using the `count` method, which is correctly implemented in the provided code. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the code itself. The function correctly handles the case where `s` might be an empty string, as `count` will return 0 in such a scenario.
