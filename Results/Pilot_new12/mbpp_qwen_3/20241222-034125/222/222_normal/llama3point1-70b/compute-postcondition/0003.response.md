The code `result += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `result`. Given that `char` is the first character in the string `s` and it is an uppercase letter, `result` will now be a string containing just this first character.

- `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `char` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- `result` is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value (an empty string) and `char`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter), `char` is the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter)**
