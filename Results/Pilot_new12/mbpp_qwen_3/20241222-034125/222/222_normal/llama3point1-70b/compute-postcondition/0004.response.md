Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter), and `char` is the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter).*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. Given the precondition that `s` is a non-empty string and `char` is the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter), the if condition ensures that `result` is set to this first character, which is also an uppercase letter.
