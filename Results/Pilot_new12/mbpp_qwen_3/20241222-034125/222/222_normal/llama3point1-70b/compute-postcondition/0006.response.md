The code `result += char` concatenates the `char` to the `result`. Given that `result` is initially the first character in `s` (an uppercase letter) and `char` is the second character in `s` (an uppercase letter), after executing this line, `result` will be the concatenation of the first and second characters in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is the concatenation of the first and second characters in `s`, `char` is the second character in `s`**
