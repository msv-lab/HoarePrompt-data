Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string and retain only the uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function processes each character in the input string, checks if it is uppercase, and appends it to the result if it is. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
