Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly removes lowercase substrings from a given string by iterating through each character and appending only the uppercase characters to the result string. The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings, which means keeping only the uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` returns a new string containing all uppercase letters from the input string `s`. This behavior matches the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases where the input string contains both uppercase and lowercase letters. Therefore, the program is correct.
