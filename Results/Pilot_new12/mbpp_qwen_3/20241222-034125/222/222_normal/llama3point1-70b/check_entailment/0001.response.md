Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not remove lowercase substrings as described. Instead, it only keeps uppercase characters and removes all other characters (including lowercase letters). For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output would be "HW", but the program will return an empty string because it only adds uppercase characters to the result. Therefore, this program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
