Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string and retains only the uppercase characters. The provided function `func_1` accomplishes this by iterating through each character in the input string `s`, checking if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and appending it to the `result` string if it is. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each character of the input string and collects only the uppercase characters into the `result` string. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
