Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, whereas the current implementation only retains uppercase characters and discards all lowercase characters. 

To correctly implement the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase characters from the string. Here's how the corrected version would look:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if not char.islower():
            result += char
    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- We iterate through each character in the string `s`.
- We check if the character is not lowercase using `if not char.islower()`.
- If the condition is true, we append the character to the `result` string.
- Finally, we return the `result` string, which contains all non-lowercase characters from the original string `s`.

This implementation correctly removes lowercase substrings as per the problem description.
