Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each character of the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and appends it to the result string `result` if it is uppercase. The function then returns `result`, which contains all the uppercase characters from `s` in the order they appear. This matches the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. The annotated version further clarifies the state of the program at different points, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
