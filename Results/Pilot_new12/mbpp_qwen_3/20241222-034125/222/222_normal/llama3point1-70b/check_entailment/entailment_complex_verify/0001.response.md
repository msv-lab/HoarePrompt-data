Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not remove lowercase substrings as described in the problem statement. Instead, it constructs a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a string containing all uppercase letters from the input string, not removing any lowercase substrings. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
