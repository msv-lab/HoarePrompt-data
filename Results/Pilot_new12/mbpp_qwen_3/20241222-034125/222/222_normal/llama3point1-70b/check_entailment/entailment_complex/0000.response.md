Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program actually removes lowercase characters and keeps uppercase characters. Specifically, the program constructs a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. Therefore, it does not remove lowercase substrings as required. Instead, it retains uppercase characters and discards lowercase ones, which is a different operation from what was asked.
