Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only removes lowercase substrings by keeping only the uppercase characters in the input string. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings entirely, not just keep uppercase characters. For instance, if the input string is "AbcDefG", the expected output would be an empty string because the entire string is lowercase. But the current implementation will return "AbcDefG" as it only keeps uppercase characters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
