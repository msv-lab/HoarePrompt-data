The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string `result` that contains all the uppercase letters from `s` in the order they appear. If `s` is empty or contains no uppercase letters, the function returns an empty string. The function iterates through each character in `s`, checks if the character is uppercase, and if so, appends it to `result`. No other transformations or operations are performed on the characters in `s`.
