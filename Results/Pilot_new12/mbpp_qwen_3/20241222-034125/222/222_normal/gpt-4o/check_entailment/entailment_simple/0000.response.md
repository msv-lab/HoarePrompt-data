Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function `func_1` returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. 

For example, according to the problem description, if the input is `'PYTHon'`, the expected output would be `'PYTHon'` with the substring `'on'` removed, resulting in `'PYTH'`. However, the current implementation returns `'PYTH'`, which contains only the uppercase characters.

To correctly implement the function, you should iterate through the string and remove any character that is lowercase. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])

# Test cases
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'
```

This version ensures that all lowercase characters are removed, as required by the problem description.
