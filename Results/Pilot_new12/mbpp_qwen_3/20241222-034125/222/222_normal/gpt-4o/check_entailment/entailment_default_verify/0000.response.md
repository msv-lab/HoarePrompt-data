Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string; instead, it only keeps uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function only retains uppercase characters and does not remove lowercase substrings as required by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is correct.
