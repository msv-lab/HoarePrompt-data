Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. This matches the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string, which effectively means retaining only the uppercase characters.

The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string `s`, checking if each character is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method. It then joins these uppercase characters into a new string, which is returned by the function. The function correctly handles various edge cases such as an empty string input, which results in an empty string output, and strings without any uppercase characters, which also result in an empty string output. Given the assumptions about valid inputs, the program adheres to the problem description in all cases.
