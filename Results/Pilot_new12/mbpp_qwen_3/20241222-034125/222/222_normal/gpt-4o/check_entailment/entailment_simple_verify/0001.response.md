Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The provided examples (`'PYTHon' -> 'PYTH'`, `'FInD' -> 'FID'`, `'STRinG' -> 'STRG'`) demonstrate that the function behaves as intended. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each character in the string `s` and includes only those that are uppercase, which aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided examples.
