Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code removes lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. However, the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings, which implies removing any sequence of lowercase letters, not just individual lowercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is `'abcde'`, the expected output should be an empty string because the entire substring is lowercase. But the current implementation will return `'abcde'` since it only removes individual lowercase characters, not sequences.

To fix this, the code needs to be updated to check for sequences of lowercase characters and remove them entirely. Here is an example of how the code could be modified:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            # Skip all lowercase characters
            while i < len(s) and s[i].islower():
                i += 1
        else:
            # Add the non-lowercase character to the result
            result.append(s[i])
            i += 1
    return ''.join(result)
```

This updated code will correctly remove any lowercase substrings from the input string.
