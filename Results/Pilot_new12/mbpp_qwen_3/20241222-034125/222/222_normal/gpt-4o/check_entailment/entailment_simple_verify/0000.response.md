Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the function is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided implementation only keeps uppercase characters, effectively removing all lowercase characters instead of substrings. For instance, the input `'abcDEfG'` should result in `'DEfG'`, but the current implementation results in `'DEfG'`. The annotated version confirms that the function only iterates through the string and constructs a new string with uppercase characters, which is not what the problem description requires. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
