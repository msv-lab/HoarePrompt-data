Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by retaining only the uppercase characters. The output hints confirm that the function iterates over each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and joins the uppercase characters into a new string. The examples provided (`'PYTHon' -> 'PYTH'`, `'FInD' -> 'FID'`, `'STRinG' -> 'STRG'`) demonstrate that the function works as intended. The potential edge cases mentioned (empty string and strings without uppercase characters) are correctly handled, resulting in an empty string output. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
