Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it only keeps uppercase characters. For example, if the input string is `'abcDEfG'`, the expected output would be `'DEfG'`, but the program will return `'DEfG'` without removing the lowercase substrings `'bc'`. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through each character in the string and construct a new string by including only those characters that are not lowercase. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This version ensures that all lowercase characters are removed, and only uppercase characters remain in the resulting string.
