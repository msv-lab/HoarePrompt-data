Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string and includes only those characters that are uppercase. The examples provided (`'PYTHon' -> 'PYTH'`, `'FInD' -> 'FID'`, `'STRinG' -> 'STRG'`) all demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since there are no lowercase letters in the resulting strings, the function correctly fulfills the requirement of removing lowercase substrings. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
