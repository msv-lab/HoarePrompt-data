Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase, and joins the uppercase characters into a new string. The provided test cases (`'PYTHon' -> 'PYTH'`, `'FInD' -> 'FID'`, `'STRinG' -> 'STRG'`) demonstrate that the function behaves as intended. Additionally, the annotated version clarifies that the function does not modify the original string but returns a new one, which aligns with the problem description. There are no issues with the function's implementation or behavior based on the provided information.
