Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it removes all lowercase characters, leaving only uppercase characters. According to the problem description, the goal is to remove lowercase substrings, which means removing sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters.

For example, the function `func_1('PYTHon')` should remove the substring "on" resulting in "PYTH", but the current implementation will return "PYTH". Similarly, `func_1('FInD')` should not change the string as there are no lowercase substrings, but the current implementation will return "FID".

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
