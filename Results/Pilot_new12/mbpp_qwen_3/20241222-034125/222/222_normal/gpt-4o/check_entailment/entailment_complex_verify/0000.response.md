Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, meaning that any lowercase characters should be removed entirely, not just isolated characters. However, the annotated version and the original assessment correctly point out that the current implementation of `func_1` only retains uppercase characters, leaving lowercase ones in place. This means the function does not meet the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
