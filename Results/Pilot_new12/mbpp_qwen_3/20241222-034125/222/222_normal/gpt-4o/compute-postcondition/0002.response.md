Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`. The function achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in `s`, checking if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and then joining these characters into a new string. The function does not modify the original string `s`; instead, it creates and returns a new string. Potential edge cases include an empty string input, which would result in an empty string output, and strings without any uppercase characters, which would also result in an empty string output. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
