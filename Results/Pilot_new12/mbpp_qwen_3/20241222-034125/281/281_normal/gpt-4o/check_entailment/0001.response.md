Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). The provided test cases cover different scenarios including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases, we can conclude that the program is correct for the given problem description.
