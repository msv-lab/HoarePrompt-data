Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension `return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` ensures that all even numbers are included in the returned list, and no odd numbers are present. The provided assertions cover various scenarios including lists with even and odd numbers, lists with even numbers only, and lists with both even and odd numbers, all of which produce the correct results. Since the code handles all tested cases correctly and no edge cases are missed, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
