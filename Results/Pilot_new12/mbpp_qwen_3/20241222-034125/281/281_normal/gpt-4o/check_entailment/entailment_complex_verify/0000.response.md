Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers. The annotated version clearly describes the behavior of the function and aligns with the problem description. The function handles the provided test cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
