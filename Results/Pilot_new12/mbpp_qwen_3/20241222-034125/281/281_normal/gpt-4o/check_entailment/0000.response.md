Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers using a list comprehension. It checks each number in the list to see if it is divisible by 2 (`num % 2 == 0`) and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. The function works for the given test cases and appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
