Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list. The annotations clearly state that the function takes a list of integers and returns a list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers, and the function behaves as expected in all these cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is supported by the annotated version and the problem description.
