Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 (`num % 2 == 0`). The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including edge cases like an empty list (which would return an empty list). Since the function meets the problem description and handles all tested cases appropriately, the program is correct.
