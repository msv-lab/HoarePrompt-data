Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly concludes that the program is correct. The provided function `func_1` accurately filters out even numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios appropriately, such as lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and the output hints align with this behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
