Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs:

1. It correctly identifies even numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and returns `[2, 4]`.
2. It correctly identifies even numbers in the list `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]` and returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
3. It correctly identifies even numbers in the list `[8, 12, 15, 19]` and returns `[8, 12]`.

The list comprehension within the function filters out the even numbers by checking if `num % 2 == 0`. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds even numbers from a list of numbers, and the provided implementation correctly accomplishes this, the program is correct.
