Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (`num % 2 == 0`). The test cases provided in the annotations cover various scenarios, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
