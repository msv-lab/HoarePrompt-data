Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing only the even numbers from the original `numbers` list. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function correctly filters out odd numbers and retains only the even ones.**

- The function iterates through each element in the `numbers` list.
- It checks if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).
- If the number is even, it includes it in the returned list.
- The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned list contains only the even numbers from the original `numbers` list.
