#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even numbers from the original `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It filters out the odd numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function correctly handles lists that contain both even and odd integers, as well as edge cases such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If the list contains only odd numbers, the function also returns an empty list. The function does not modify the original list; it creates a new list containing the filtered even numbers.
