Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). This logic satisfies the problem description for all potential cases, as it will correctly return a list containing only the even numbers from the input list. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail according to the problem description.
