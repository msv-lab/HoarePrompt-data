Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling various scenarios including empty lists and lists with only odd numbers. The function does not modify the original list and instead returns a new list containing only the even numbers, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
