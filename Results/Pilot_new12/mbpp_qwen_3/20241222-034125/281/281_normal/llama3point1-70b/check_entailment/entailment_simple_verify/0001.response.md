Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of integers. The annotated version supports this by indicating that `numbers` is a list of integers and that the function returns a list of even numbers from the original `numbers` list. The code does not contain any logical errors or exceptions under the assumption of valid input, thus meeting the problem description.
