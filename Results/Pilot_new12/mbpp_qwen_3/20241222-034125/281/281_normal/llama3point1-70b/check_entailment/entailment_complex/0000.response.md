Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The provided comment accurately describes the behavior of the function:

- It filters out odd numbers and returns a new list containing only even numbers.
- It correctly handles an empty list by returning an empty list.
- It handles a list with no even numbers by returning an empty list.
- It does not modify the original list; instead, it creates a new list with the filtered results.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles all relevant edge cases, the program is correct.
