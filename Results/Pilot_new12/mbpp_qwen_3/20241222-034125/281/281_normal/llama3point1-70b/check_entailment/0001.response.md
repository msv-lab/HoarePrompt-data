Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers which are even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This logic covers all potential cases where the input list contains integers, as it will correctly filter out odd numbers and include even ones. Since the function meets the problem description for any input list of integers, the correctness is **True**.
