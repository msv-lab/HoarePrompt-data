Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The code uses a list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers, which is an efficient and correct approach. The function handles various cases, including:

- An empty list, returning an empty list.
- A list with only odd numbers, also returning an empty list.
- A list with both even and odd numbers, returning a list of only the even numbers.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for these cases. There are no potential edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
