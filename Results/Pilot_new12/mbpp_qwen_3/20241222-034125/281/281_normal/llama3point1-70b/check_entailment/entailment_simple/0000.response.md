Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding even numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and includes it in the returned list only if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This exactly matches the problem description which asks for a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function will return a list of even numbers for any valid input list of integers, as per the given assumptions. Therefore, the program is correct.
