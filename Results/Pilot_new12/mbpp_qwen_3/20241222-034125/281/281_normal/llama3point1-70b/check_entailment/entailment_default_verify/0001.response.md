Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of finding even numbers from a list of numbers. The provided output hints further confirm that the function works as intended, handling various cases such as empty lists and lists containing only odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to filter even numbers without modifying the original list, and it returns a new list containing only the even numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
