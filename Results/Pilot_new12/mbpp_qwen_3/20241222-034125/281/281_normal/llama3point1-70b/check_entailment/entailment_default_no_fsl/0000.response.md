Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to filter out even numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers` and includes only those numbers that are even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). The function handles various edge cases such as an empty list, a list containing only odd numbers, and a list with mixed even and odd numbers. The function also does not modify the original list, creating a new list with the filtered results. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to work correctly for every potential case.
