Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct because it aligns with the problem description. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the column index `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. Since the problem description does not explicitly mention handling such edge cases, the function is not fully correct as it can fail when given invalid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this potential issue.
