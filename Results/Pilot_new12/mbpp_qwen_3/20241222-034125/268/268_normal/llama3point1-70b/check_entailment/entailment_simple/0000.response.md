Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the problem description because it returns the maximum value of the element located at position `n-1` in each row, whereas the problem description requires finding the maximum value of the `n`-th column. In Python, list indices start at 0, so the `n`-th column would correspond to index `n-1`. However, the problem description specifies the `n`-th column, which would correspond to index `n`.

To fix this, the program should change the index from `n-1` to `n`:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This corrected version will correctly find the maximum value of the `n`-th column in the matrix.
