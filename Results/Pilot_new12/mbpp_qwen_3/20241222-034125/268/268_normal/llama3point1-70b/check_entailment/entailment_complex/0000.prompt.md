You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < the number of columns in the matrix.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value of the element located in the position (n-1) in each row of the matrix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, accesses the element at index `n-1` in each row, and computes the maximum value among these elements. The function handles the case where `n` is within the bounds of the matrix columns, but does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. If the matrix is empty or `n` is outside the valid range, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
