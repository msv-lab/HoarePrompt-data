Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the n'th element of each row in the matrix and returns the maximum value found. This approach handles all potential cases as long as the matrix is well-formed (i.e., all rows have enough elements to access the n'th column). Since the function works for any valid input matrix and column index `n`, there are no specific cases where it fails to meet the problem description.
