You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
Program:
```
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The expression `row[n - 1]` accesses the n'th element in each row (where the index is 0-based), and `max` returns the maximum value among these elements. This logic aligns with the problem description for any valid matrix and any valid column index `n`. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the provided logic, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, accesses the element at index `n-1` in each row, and computes the maximum value among these elements. The function handles the case where `n` is within the bounds of the matrix columns, but does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. If the matrix is empty or `n` is outside the valid range, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
