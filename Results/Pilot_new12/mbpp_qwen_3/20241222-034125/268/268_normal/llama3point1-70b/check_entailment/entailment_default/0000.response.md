Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the column index `n` is out of bounds. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column in the given matrix. However, the function uses `row[n - 1]`, which will result in an `IndexError` if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row of the matrix. Although the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, the code itself does not include any checks to prevent this error. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
