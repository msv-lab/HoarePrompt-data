Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the column index `n` is out of bounds for the given matrix. Specifically, if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row of the matrix, the code will raise an `IndexError`. According to the output hints, this case is not handled correctly, which violates the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for every potential case.
