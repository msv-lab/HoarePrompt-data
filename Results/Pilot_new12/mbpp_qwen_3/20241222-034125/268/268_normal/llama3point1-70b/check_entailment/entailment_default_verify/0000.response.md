Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. However, based on the output hints, the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. Since the problem description requires the function to correctly handle any valid input matrix and column index `n`, the function should include error handling for out-of-bounds indices. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the function can fail to execute correctly if `n` exceeds the number of columns in the matrix.
