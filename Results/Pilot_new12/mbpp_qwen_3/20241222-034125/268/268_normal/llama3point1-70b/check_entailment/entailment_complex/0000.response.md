Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column. However, the current implementation accesses the element at `row[n - 1]` for each row, which corresponds to the (n-1)th element in each row, not the nth column. To correctly find the maximum value of the nth column, the program should access `row[n]` instead of `row[n - 1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    # Check if the matrix is empty or if n is out of bounds
    if not matrix or n < 0 or n >= len(matrix[0]):
        raise IndexError("Invalid column index")
    
    # Return the maximum value of the n'th column
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly return the maximum value of the n'th column, matching the problem description.
