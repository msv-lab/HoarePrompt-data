Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The expression `row[n - 1]` accesses the n'th element in each row (where the index is 0-based), and `max` returns the maximum value among these elements. This logic aligns with the problem description for any valid matrix and any valid column index `n`. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the provided logic, the program is correct.
