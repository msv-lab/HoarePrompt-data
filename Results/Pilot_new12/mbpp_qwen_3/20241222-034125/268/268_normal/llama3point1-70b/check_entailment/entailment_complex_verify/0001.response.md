Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment assumes that the program handles all valid inputs correctly, but the annotated version reveals that the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. While the original assessment stated that the function is correct, it did not account for the fact that the function may raise an exception when `n` is not within the valid range of column indices. Therefore, based on the provided annotated version, the program does not fully meet the problem description as it fails to handle invalid column indices gracefully, leading to potential runtime errors.
