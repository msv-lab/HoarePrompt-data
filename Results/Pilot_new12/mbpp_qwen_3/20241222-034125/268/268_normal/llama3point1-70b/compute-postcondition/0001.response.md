The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the matrix, and `n`, which is an integer such that `0 <= n <` the number of columns in the matrix. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a matrix and an integer `n`, and return the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix.**
