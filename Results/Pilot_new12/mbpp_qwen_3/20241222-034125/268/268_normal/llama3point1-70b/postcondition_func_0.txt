The function `func_1` accepts a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the element located in the position `(n-1)` in each row of the matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, accesses the element at index `n-1` in each row, and computes the maximum value among these elements. The function handles the case where `n` is within the bounds of the matrix columns, but does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, which would result in an `IndexError`. If the matrix is empty or `n` is outside the valid range, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
