#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the nth_column list, which contains elements from the n-th column of the matrix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`. It extracts the n-th column from the matrix and returns the maximum value found in that column. The function handles the case where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). If `n` is out of bounds, the function will raise an `IndexError` since the column extraction using list comprehension will attempt to access an invalid index. The function does not handle any other edge cases or missing functionality beyond ensuring `n` is within bounds.
