Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `matrix`, which is a 2D list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the column index. This matches the expected inputs as per the problem description.

2. **Column Extraction**: The function uses list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix. Specifically, `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]` creates a list containing the `n`-th element from each row of the matrix. This correctly identifies the column to be processed.

3. **Max Value Calculation**: The function then returns the maximum value from the extracted `nth_column` using the built-in `max()` function. This ensures that the function returns the largest value present in the specified column.

4. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description mentions that the function should handle cases where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])), the provided implementation does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be out of bounds. However, the problem statement allows for this behavior, as it states, "If `n` is out of bounds, the function will raise an `IndexError`." Given this assumption, the function is correct because it adheres to the expected behavior described.

Since the function correctly performs the task of finding the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix, and there are no other requirements or constraints mentioned in the problem description that the function fails to meet, the program is correct.
