Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum value in the n-th column of a given matrix. The original assessment concluded that the function is correct, and the provided assertions cover various scenarios where the function is expected to return the correct maximum value. 

The annotated version clarifies that the program will return the maximum value from the specified column, and the state of the program before the function call confirms that the input is valid and within the expected format. Although the annotated version suggests handling edge cases like empty matrices or out-of-range indices, the original problem description and provided tests indicate that the function should work correctly for the given inputs.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate. The function meets the problem description and the provided assertions support its correctness.
