Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid inputs, so the program does not need to handle invalid cases explicitly. It correctly processes a 2D list of integers and an integer index within the bounds of the matrix columns.

2. **Column Extraction**: The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly extracts the elements from the `n`-th column of the matrix.

3. **Finding Maximum Value**: The `max()` function is used to find the maximum value in the extracted column, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios (e.g., different values and lengths of the matrix, different values of `n`) and verify that the function behaves as expected.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all required cases, the correctness is **True**.
