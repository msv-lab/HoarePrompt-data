Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` according to the problem description. It extracts the n-th column from the given matrix and returns the maximum value in that column. The code handles the case where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])), and it raises an `IndexError` if `n` is out of bounds, which aligns with the output hints. There are no additional edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described.
