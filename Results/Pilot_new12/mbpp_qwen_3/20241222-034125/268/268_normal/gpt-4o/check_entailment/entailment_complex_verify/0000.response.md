Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the n-th column from the given matrix and returns the maximum value of that column. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function handles the case where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])), and it raises an `IndexError` if `n` is out of bounds. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided assertions, indicating that the program is correct.
