Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the maximum value in the n-th column of a given matrix. The code uses list comprehension to extract the n-th column and then applies the `max` function to find the maximum value in that column. The examples given in the problem description are handled correctly, and the function works as expected for the provided test cases. There are no issues with handling out-of-bound indices since the problem description assumes valid inputs, and the code does not need to handle invalid or empty inputs as specified. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
