Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where the column index `n` is within bounds, and an `IndexError` is raised if `n` is out of bounds. While the function does not explicitly handle the cases where the matrix is empty or the column index is out of range in a specific way (e.g., returning `None`), the original assessment correctly states that the function works as intended for the provided test cases. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle these edge cases, and the provided tests cover typical use cases, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
