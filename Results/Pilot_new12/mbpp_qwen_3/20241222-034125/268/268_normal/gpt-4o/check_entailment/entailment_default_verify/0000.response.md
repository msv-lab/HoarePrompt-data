Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment states that the program is correct, the output hints provide additional information that the program does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds, specifically it will raise an `IndexError`. According to the problem description, the function should extract the `n`-th column and return the maximum value. However, without handling the case where `n` is out of bounds, the function is incomplete and does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this oversight.
