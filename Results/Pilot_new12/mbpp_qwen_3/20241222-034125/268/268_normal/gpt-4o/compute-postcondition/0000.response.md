The code creates a new list `nth_column` which contains the elements from the `n`-th column of the `matrix`. This operation does not affect the `matrix` itself or the value of `n`. The `matrix` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **matrix is a 2D list of integers, `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), and `nth_column` is a list containing the elements from the n-th column of `matrix`.**
