The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a 2D list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. The function returns the maximum value from the nth_column list, which contains elements from the n-th column of the matrix.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, and return the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix.
