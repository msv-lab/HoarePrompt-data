Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`. It extracts the n-th column from the matrix and returns the maximum value found in that column. The function handles the case where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])). If `n` is out of bounds, the function will raise an `IndexError` since the column extraction using list comprehension will attempt to access an invalid index. The function does not handle any other edge cases or missing functionality beyond ensuring `n` is within bounds.**
