Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers and returning a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function iterates over the input tuple up to the second-to-last element, multiplying each element with its successor and generating a new tuple from these products. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including tuples with different lengths and values, and the function passes all of them. Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the logic seems sound, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works as expected for the described problem.
