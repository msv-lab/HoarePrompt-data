Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function handles different lengths of input tuples, including a single-element tuple which results in an empty tuple as expected. Based on the provided assertions, the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since no edge cases or inputs have been found where the function fails, the program is considered correct.
