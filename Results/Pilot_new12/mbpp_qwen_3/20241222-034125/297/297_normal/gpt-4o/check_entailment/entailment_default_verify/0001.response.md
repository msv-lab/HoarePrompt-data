Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers and returning a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The output hints confirm that the function returns an empty tuple if the input tuple has less than two elements, which aligns with the problem description. The function passes the provided test cases and the logic is sound for the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
