Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The output hints confirm this behavior and mention that the function returns an empty tuple if the input tuple has less than two elements. Given the assertions provided and the logical implementation of the function, the program is correct according to the problem description and the output hints.
