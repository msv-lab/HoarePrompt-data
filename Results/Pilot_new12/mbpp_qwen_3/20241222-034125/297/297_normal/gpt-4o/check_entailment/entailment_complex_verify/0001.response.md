Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers and returning a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The annotated version clarifies that the function does not handle the case where the input tuple has less than two elements, resulting in an empty tuple being returned. However, this is explicitly stated in the problem description as well, and no test cases are provided that involve tuples with fewer than two elements. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the provided annotations support the correctness of the function. Hence, the original assessment is accurate.
