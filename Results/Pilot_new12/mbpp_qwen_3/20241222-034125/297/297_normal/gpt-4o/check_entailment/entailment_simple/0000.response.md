Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple `t` of numbers (of length \(N+1\)) as input and returns a new tuple of length \(N\) where the \(i\)-th element is the product of the \(i\)-th and \((i+1)\)-th elements from the input tuple `t`. The program uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to compute the products for each pair of consecutive elements in the input tuple, excluding the last element since there is no subsequent element to multiply with.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- The function `func_1(t)` is defined to take a single argument `t`, which is expected to be a tuple.
- The function returns a tuple of length \(N\) (where \(N = \text{len}(t) - 1\)), constructed using a generator expression that multiplies each element `t[i]` with the next element `t[i + 1]`.
- The range used in the generator expression (`range(len(t) - 1)`) ensures that only pairs of consecutive elements are considered up to the second-to-last element of the input tuple.
- The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected:
  - For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.
  - For the input `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output is `(8, 20, 30, 42)`.
  - For the input `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)`, the output is `(156, 182, 126, 135)`.
  - For the input `(12,)` (a single-element tuple), the output is `()`, which matches the requirement since there are no consecutive elements to multiply.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description and handles all tested cases correctly, the program is indeed correct.
