Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) of length \( N+1 \), where \( N \) is a non-negative integer.
2. For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( len(t) - 2 \), it computes the product of the elements at positions \( i \) and \( i+1 \).
3. The results are collected into a new tuple, which is returned as the output.

The provided assertions cover various cases, including tuples with different lengths and containing integers and floats. In each case, the function generates a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple.

Since the function correctly performs the specified operation and handles all given test cases without error, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
