Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements the function `func_1` which takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The code handles the case where the input tuple has at least two elements correctly. The examples in the output hints and the provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for tuples with more than two elements. Since the problem description specifies that the input tuple has a length of \(N+1\) where \(N\) is a non-negative integer, the function correctly returns an empty tuple for inputs with less than two elements, as shown in the assertion for a single-element tuple `(12,)`. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
