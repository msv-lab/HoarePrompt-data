Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of length N+1 and returns a new tuple of length N where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to create the desired output tuple. 

The assertions in the code cover various test cases, including tuples with different lengths and values, and the function produces the correct results for these cases. Additionally, the function handles the edge case of an input tuple with fewer than two elements by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the code meets the requirements for all given test cases and handles the edge case appropriately, the program is considered correct.
