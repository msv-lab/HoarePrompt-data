Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`. The function does not handle the case where the input tuple `t` has less than two elements, resulting in an empty tuple being returned in such scenarios.**

- The function iterates through the input tuple `t` using a generator expression, multiplying each element `t[i]` with its consecutive element `t[i + 1]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `len(t) - 2`.
- If the input tuple `t` has fewer than two elements (i.e., its length is 1), the function will produce an empty tuple as no products can be computed between consecutive elements.
- Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes will be a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`, or an empty tuple if the input tuple has less than two elements.
