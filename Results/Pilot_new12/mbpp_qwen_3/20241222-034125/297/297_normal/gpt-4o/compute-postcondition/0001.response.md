The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers (integers or floats) of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. The function returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` and return a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`.
