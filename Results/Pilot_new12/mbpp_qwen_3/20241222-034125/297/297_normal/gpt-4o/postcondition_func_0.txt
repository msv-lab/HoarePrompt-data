The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (integers or floats) of length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`. The function does not handle the case where the input tuple `t` has less than two elements, resulting in an empty tuple being returned in such scenarios.
