Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to create the new tuple. The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` part pairs each element with its successor, and the generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` multiplies these pairs together. This approach handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element by returning an empty tuple, as there are no pairs to form products. Thus, the code works correctly for every potential case as described.
