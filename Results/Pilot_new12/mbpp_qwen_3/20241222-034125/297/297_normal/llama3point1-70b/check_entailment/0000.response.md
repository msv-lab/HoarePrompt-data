Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each element in the input tuple, it multiplies the current element with the next element and returns a new tuple containing these products. This works for any input tuple of length \(N+1\) where \(N > 0\). There are no obvious edge cases or special conditions that would cause this function to fail based on the given description and general understanding of tuple operations and the `zip` function in Python. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
