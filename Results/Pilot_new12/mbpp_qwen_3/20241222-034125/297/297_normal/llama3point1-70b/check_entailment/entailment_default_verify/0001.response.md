Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where the tuple has only one element by returning an empty tuple, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the function meets the requirements and there are no other edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the original assessment of correctness being True is justified.
