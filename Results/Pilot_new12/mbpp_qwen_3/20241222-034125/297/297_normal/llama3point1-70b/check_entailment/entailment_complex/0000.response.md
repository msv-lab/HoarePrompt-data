Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. 

- The function accepts a tuple of integers or floats, and the length of the tuple is \(N+1\) where \(N\) is a positive integer.
- It uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to compute the products. Specifically, it iterates over the elements of the tuple using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, which pairs each element with its successor, and multiplies them together.
- The resulting tuple has a length of \(N\), as required by the problem description.

The provided code does not contain any edge cases or missing functionality that would violate the problem description under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
