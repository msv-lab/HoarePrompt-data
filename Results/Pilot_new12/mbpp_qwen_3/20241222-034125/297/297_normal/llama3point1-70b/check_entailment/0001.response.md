Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description exactly. For any tuple of length \(N+1\), the function correctly computes the products \(t_i \times t_{i+1}\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(N-1\). There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail according to the given problem description.
