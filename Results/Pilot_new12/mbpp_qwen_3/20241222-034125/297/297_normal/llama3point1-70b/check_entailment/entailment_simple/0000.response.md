Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

- The function takes a tuple `numbers` as input, where the length of the tuple is \( N+1 \) and \( N \) is a positive integer.
- It uses a generator expression inside a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple. The generator expression iterates over pairs of consecutive elements in the input tuple (`a` and `b`), multiplying them together.
- The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` function creates pairs of consecutive elements, such that `a` is the i-th element and `b` is the (i+1)-th element of the input tuple. This ensures that each element in the output tuple is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple.
- For example, if `numbers = (a, b, c, d)`, the returned tuple would be `(a*b, b*c, c*d)`.

Since the function adheres to the specified behavior for all valid inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
