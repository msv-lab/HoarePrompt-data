Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles the edge case where the tuple has only one element by returning an empty tuple. Since the program behaves as expected according to the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any additional issues, the original assessment remains accurate.
