Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple, as described in the problem statement. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, producing a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple, shifted by one position. Since the annotated version aligns with the problem description and there are no issues identified, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
