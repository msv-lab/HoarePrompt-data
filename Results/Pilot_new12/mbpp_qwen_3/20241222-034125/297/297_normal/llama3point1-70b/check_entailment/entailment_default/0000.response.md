Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to achieve this. It handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element by returning an empty tuple, as there would be no subsequent elements to multiply with.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case, including edge cases, the program is correct.
