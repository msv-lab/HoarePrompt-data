#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of integers or floats, and the length of the tuple is N+1 where N is a positive integer.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple `numbers` shifted by one position. For example, if `numbers = (a, b, c, d)`, the returned tuple would be `(a*b, b*c, c*d)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats, where the length of the tuple is `N+1`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. The function handles edge cases such as when the tuple has only one element, in which case an empty tuple is returned. No other edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code.
