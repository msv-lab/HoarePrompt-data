The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a tuple of integers or floats. The length of the tuple is `N+1`, where `N` is a positive integer.

The function returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the original tuple `numbers` shifted by one position. For example, if `numbers = (a, b, c, d)`, the returned tuple would be `(a*b, b*c, c*d)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats, and return a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple.
