Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats, where the length of the tuple is `N+1`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the current element and the next element in the original tuple. The function handles edge cases such as when the tuple has only one element, in which case an empty tuple is returned. No other edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code.**
