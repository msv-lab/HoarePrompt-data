Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative real numbers, and returns their product. There are no additional actions or edge cases beyond this basic functionality. The function simply multiplies the two input values and returns the result.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either `length` or `width` is exactly zero, the function will return zero, as the product of any number and zero is zero.
- If either `length` or `width` is a negative number, the function will raise a `TypeError` since the parameters are specified as non-negative real numbers. However, the annotations do not account for this restriction, so it is an important consideration.
