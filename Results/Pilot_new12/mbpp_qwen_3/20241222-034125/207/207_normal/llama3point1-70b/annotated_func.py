#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which are non-negative real numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative real numbers, and returns their product. There are no additional actions or edge cases beyond this basic functionality. The function simply multiplies the two input values and returns the result.
