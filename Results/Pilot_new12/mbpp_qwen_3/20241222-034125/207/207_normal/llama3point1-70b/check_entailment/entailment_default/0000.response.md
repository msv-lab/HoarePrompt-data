Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation of the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. Given the problem description to "Write a function to find the area of a rectangle," the function satisfies this requirement. The output hints confirm that the function simply multiplies the two input parameters and returns the result, which aligns with the problem description. There are no additional conditions or edge cases mentioned that would make the function incorrect under the assumption of valid inputs.
