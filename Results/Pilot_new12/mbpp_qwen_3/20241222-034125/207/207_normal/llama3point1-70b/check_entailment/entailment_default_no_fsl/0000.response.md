Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the correct formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs (non-negative real numbers). Since the hints indicate that there are no additional actions or edge cases beyond this basic functionality, and the code meets the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is True.
