Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are non-negative real numbers, and returns their product. This directly corresponds to calculating the area of a rectangle, as the area is found by multiplying the length by the width. The program does not perform any additional actions beyond this basic functionality, adhering strictly to the problem description provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
