Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. According to the problem description, the task is to write a function to find the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and width, which matches exactly what the function `func_1` does. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints beyond the inputs being non-negative real numbers (which are implied by the context), the provided function correctly implements the required functionality.
