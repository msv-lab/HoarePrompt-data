Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. Given the problem description to write a function that finds the area of a rectangle, this function satisfies the requirement for all potential cases where both length and width are positive numbers. There is no edge case mentioned in the problem description that this function does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
