Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the function to find the area of a rectangle. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are both non-negative floating-point numbers or integers, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. The provided assertions verify that the function works as expected for different valid inputs. Since the problem description only requires the function to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width, and the program strictly adheres to this requirement without performing any additional actions or handling invalid inputs, the program is correct.
