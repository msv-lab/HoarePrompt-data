Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The assertions in the code cover multiple scenarios (positive integers, positive integers with smaller dimensions), and there are no indications in the problem description that require handling specific edge cases like negative values, zero, or non-numeric inputs. Given the assumptions that the inputs are valid and will not cause errors, the function works correctly for every potential case described in the problem.
