Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width. The function `func_1` correctly implements this calculation by returning `length * width`.

The test cases provided (`assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, `assert func_1(10, 5) == 50`, `assert func_1(4, 2) == 8`) all use valid inputs (positive integers) and verify that the function returns the correct area for these inputs. Since the function always returns the product of the inputs, it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for the given inputs.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
