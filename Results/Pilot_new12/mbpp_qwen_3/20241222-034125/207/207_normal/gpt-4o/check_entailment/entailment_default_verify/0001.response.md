Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The provided test cases (assertions) pass with the expected results. The problem description specifies that the task is to write a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is exactly what `func_1` does. The output hints confirm that the function only multiplies the two parameters and handles them as non-negative numeric values, which is sufficient for the given problem description. No additional edge cases were mentioned that would invalidate the current assessment.
