Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The function handles the basic case where both length and width are positive integers or floating-point numbers. Given the problem description to find the area of a rectangle, the function satisfies the requirement. The assertions provided also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the problem description does not specify any additional edge cases such as negative values, zero values, or non-numeric inputs, and assuming valid inputs, the function is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem.
