Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and confirm that the function works as expected. The annotations support this by stating that the length and width are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers, and the function returns their product. There are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
