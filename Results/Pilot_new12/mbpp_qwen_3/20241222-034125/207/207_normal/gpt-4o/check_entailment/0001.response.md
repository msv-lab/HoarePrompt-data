Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle correctly by multiplying the length and width. The assertions given in the code also pass with the expected results. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is implemented accurately by the function, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases within the scope of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
