The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the product of `length` and `width`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative parameters `length` and `width`, and return their product.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `length` and `width`, both non-negative floating-point numbers or integers, and returns the product of `length` and `width`.**
