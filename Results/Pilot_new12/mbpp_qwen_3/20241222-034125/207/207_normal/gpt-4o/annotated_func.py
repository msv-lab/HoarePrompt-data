#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which are non-negative floating-point numbers or integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are both non-negative floating-point numbers or integers. It returns their product. There are no additional actions performed beyond multiplying the two parameters. The function does not handle any edge cases such as negative values, zero values, or non-numeric inputs. If `length` or `width` are not valid numbers, the function will raise a TypeError. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single value, which is the product of `length` and `width`.
