Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the ASCII value of a character. The `func_1` function accomplishes this by using the built-in `ord()` function, which returns the ASCII value of a given character. The provided test cases (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) verify that the function correctly computes the ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
