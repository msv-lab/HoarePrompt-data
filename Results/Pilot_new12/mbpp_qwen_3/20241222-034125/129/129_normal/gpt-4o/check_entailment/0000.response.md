Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord` function. The examples given (`'A' == 65`, `'R' == 82`, `'S' == 83`) all produce the expected results. Since the `ord` function works for all printable ASCII characters, and the examples cover a few different characters, we can infer that the function will work correctly for any single character input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
