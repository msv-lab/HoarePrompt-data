Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. The function is tested with three assertions that check if the ASCII values of 'A', 'R', and 'S' are correctly returned (65, 82, and 83, respectively). The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, mapping each character to its corresponding ASCII value without any additional actions or edge cases. Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program works correctly for the specified cases and would handle other valid inputs in the same manner.
