Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The assertions in the annotated version confirm that `func_1('A') == 65`, `func_1('R') == 82`, and `func_1('S') == 83`, which are all correct according to the ASCII table. Since the function and assertions cover a few valid cases and the problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character, the function meets the requirements. The annotated version also supports this by stating that the function correctly maps each character to its corresponding ordinal value without any additional actions or edge cases to consider. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
