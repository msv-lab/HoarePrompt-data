Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the ASCII value of a character, and it does exactly that by using the built-in `ord()` function. The provided assertions check that the function correctly returns the ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which are 65, 82, and 83 respectively. Since the function processes a single character string as expected and returns its corresponding ASCII value, it fulfills the problem description without any additional actions or edge cases that were not specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
