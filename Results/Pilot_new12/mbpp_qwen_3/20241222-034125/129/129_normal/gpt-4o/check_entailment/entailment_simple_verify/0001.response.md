Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The test cases provided in the form of assertions (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) are correct, and the annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, returning the ordinal value of the input character. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character, and the provided function fulfills this requirement without any apparent issues, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
