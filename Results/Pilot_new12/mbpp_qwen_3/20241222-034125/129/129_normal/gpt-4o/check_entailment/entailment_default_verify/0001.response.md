Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character, and the provided test cases assert that the function returns the correct values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. The output hints confirm that the function handles the input as a single character string and maps it to its corresponding ordinal value. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character and the function fulfills this requirement with the provided test cases, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
