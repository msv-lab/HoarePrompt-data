Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the ASCII value of a character, which it accomplishes using the built-in `ord` function. The provided assertions verify that the function works as intended for the given characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), and the output hints confirm that the function simply maps each character to its corresponding ordinal value. Since the input is guaranteed to be a single character string, there are no edge cases or additional actions required. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
