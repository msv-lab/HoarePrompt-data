Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases ('A', 'R', and 'S'). Since the input is guaranteed to be a single character string, there are no additional edge cases to consider. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case within the given constraints.
