Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character. The test cases assert that `func_1('A') == 65`, `func_1('R') == 82`, and `func_1('S') == 83`, which are all correct. Since the `ord()` function works for all printable ASCII characters, and the function and assertions cover a few valid cases, we can conclude that the function works as expected for the described problem. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
