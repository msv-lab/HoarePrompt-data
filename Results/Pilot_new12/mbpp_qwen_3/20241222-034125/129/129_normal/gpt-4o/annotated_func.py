#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ordinal value of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ordinal value using the `ord()` function. There are no additional actions or edge cases to consider beyond this. The function correctly maps each character to its corresponding ordinal value, which is an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character. Since the input is guaranteed to be a single character string, there are no special cases or missing functionalities to note.
