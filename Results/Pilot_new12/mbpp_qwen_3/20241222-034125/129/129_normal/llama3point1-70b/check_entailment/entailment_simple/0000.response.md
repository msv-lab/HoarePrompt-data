Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. This exactly matches the problem description which asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. Since the function correctly uses `ord()` to achieve this for any valid single character input, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
