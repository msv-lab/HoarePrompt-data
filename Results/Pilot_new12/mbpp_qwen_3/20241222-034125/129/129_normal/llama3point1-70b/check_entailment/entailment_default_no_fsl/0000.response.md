Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the given implementation satisfies this requirement. The output hints confirm that there are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. Since the function works as expected for the given problem description and there are no valid inputs that would cause it to fail, the correctness is **True**.
