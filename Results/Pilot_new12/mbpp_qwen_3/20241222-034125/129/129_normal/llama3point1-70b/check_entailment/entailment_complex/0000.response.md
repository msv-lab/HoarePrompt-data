Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the provided function accurately performs this task without any edge cases or missing functionalities, the program is correct.
