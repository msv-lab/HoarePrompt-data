Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII numeric value. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns the ASCII value of a character, and the provided function fulfills this requirement, the function is correct for all potential cases. The annotations support the correctness of the function without indicating any issues or edge cases that would necessitate a change in the original assessment.
