Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` is designed to take a single character string as input and return its ASCII value using the `ord` function. The annotation confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning the ASCII numeric value of the input character. Since the input is assumed to be a valid single character string, the function correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
