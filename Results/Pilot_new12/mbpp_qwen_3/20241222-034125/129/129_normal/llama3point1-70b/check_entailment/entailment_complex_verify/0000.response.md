Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord` function. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII numeric value. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotated version that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
