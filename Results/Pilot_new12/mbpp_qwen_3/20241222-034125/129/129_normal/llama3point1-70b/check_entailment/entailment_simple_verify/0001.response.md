Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotated version confirms that the function processes a single character string as expected, and the behavior aligns with the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential valid inputs.
