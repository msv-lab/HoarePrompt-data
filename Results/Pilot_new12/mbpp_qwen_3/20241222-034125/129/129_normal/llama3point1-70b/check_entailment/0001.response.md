Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns the ASCII value of a character and the provided function fulfills this requirement for any single character input, the function is correct for all potential cases.
