Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles a single character string and returns its ASCII numeric value accurately. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, and the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is correct.
