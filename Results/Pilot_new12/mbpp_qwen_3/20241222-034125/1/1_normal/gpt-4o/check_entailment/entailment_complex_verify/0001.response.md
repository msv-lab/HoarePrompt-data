Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the shared elements between two lists as tuples. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, and the function passes them. The function uses sets to find common elements and then converts the result into a sorted tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function performs the required operation correctly, and there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given problem description and assumptions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
