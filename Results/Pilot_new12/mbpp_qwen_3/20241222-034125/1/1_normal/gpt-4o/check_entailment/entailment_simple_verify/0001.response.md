Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the shared elements between two lists as tuples. The annotations confirm that the function first creates sets from the input lists, finds the intersection of these sets to get common elements, sorts them, and then returns them as a tuple. The provided test cases in the assertions validate the function's behavior under different scenarios, and the annotated version supports the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains accurate.
