Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the common elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function processes the inputs correctly, converting them to sets to find the intersection and then sorting and returning the result. The test cases provided also validate the function's correctness. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the current implementation fails to address, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
