Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements found in both lists. The function correctly implements this behavior through the following steps:

1. **Convert Lists to Sets**: It converts both input lists into sets using `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`. This step ensures that duplicate elements within each list are removed.

2. **Find Common Elements**: It uses the set intersection operator `&` to find elements that are common to both sets. This operation results in a set containing only the elements present in both `list1` and `list2`.

3. **Sort and Convert to Tuple**: The resulting set of common elements is sorted using `sorted()`, which orders the elements in ascending order. Finally, the sorted sequence is converted back to a tuple using `tuple()`.

Given the problem description, the function must find the shared elements from the two given lists and return them as a sorted tuple. The provided assertions in the code verify that the function works correctly for the given examples. Since the implementation matches the described functionality and handles all listed cases properly, the program is correct.
