Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the shared elements between two lists as tuples. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements, lists with no common elements, and lists where one or both lists are empty (which would result in an empty tuple). The function uses sets to efficiently find common elements and then returns them as a sorted tuple. Since the output hints confirm that the function handles all expected edge cases and performs the required operation correctly, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
