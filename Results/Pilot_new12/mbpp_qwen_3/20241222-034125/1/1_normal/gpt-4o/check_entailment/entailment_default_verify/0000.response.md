Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the common elements from two given lists in a sorted tuple form. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function handles duplicates and different orders of elements appropriately by using set operations to find the intersection, ensuring uniqueness and sorting of the results. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the output hints that the current implementation fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
