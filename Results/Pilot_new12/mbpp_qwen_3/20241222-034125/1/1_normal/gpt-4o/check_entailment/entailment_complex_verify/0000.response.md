Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the common elements from the two input lists as a sorted tuple. The annotations clarify that the function converts the input lists into sets to find the intersection, ensuring that the resulting elements are unique and sorted. The provided test cases also validate that the function behaves as expected. Since the function handles duplicates and different orders of elements correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that the current implementation fails to address, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
