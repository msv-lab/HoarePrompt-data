Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of common elements found in both lists. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a sorted tuple. This approach ensures that the returned elements are unique and in sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the provided test cases:
1. `func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))` returns `(4, 5)`
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7))` returns `(3, 4)`
3. `func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13))` returns `(13, 14)`

The function works correctly for these cases. Additionally, since the function uses set operations to find common elements, it will handle duplicates and different orders of elements correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the current implementation fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
