Correctness: **True**

**Explanation:**
The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists (`list1` and `list2`).

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The function converts both input lists into sets using `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`. Sets are used to eliminate duplicates and allow for efficient intersection operations.
   - The intersection of the two sets is computed using the `&` operator, resulting in a set of common elements.
   - These common elements are then converted back into a tuple and returned after sorting them with `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`.

3. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - The program handles cases where the input lists might be empty. In such cases, the intersection would result in an empty set, which is then converted to an empty tuple. This behavior aligns with the expected output for the problem description.

4. **Sorting and Returning**:
   - The use of `sorted()` ensures that the common elements are returned in sorted order, as the problem description mentions the function should return a tuple containing the sorted common elements.

Given that the program accurately implements the described functionality without any deviations or omissions, it is correct according to the problem description.
