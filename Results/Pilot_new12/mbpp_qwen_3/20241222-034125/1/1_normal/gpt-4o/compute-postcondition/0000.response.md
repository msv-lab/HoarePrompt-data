The code creates a set of common elements between `list1` and `list2`. The `common_elements` variable is assigned the result of the intersection of the two sets converted from `list1` and `list2`. The original lists `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`common_elements` is the set of elements present in both `list1` and `list2`, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged.**
