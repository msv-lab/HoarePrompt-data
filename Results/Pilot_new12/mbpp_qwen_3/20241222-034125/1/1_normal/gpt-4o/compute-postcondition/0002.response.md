The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the sorted elements present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a tuple with the sorted common elements between the two lists.
