Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements between the two lists. The function first converts both lists into sets to find the intersection, which consists of elements present in both lists. It then sorts these common elements and returns them as a tuple. Potential edge cases include when one or both of the input lists are empty, in which case the function will return an empty tuple. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly performs the required operation.**
