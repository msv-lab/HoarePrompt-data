The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and return a tuple containing the common elements found in both input tuples.
