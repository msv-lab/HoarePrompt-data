#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as parameters. It computes the intersection of these two tuples by converting them into sets, finding the common elements, and then converting the result back into a tuple. The function returns a tuple containing the common elements found in both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. If there are no common elements, an empty tuple is returned. Edge cases include when one or both of the input tuples are empty, in which case the function still correctly returns an empty tuple.
