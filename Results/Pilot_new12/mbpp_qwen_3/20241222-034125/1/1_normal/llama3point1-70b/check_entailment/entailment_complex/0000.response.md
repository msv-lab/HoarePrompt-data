Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as inputs, finds the intersection of these tuples (i.e., the elements that are common to both), and returns the result as a tuple. 

- The use of `set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)` ensures that only the common elements between the two tuples are identified, which aligns with the requirement to find shared elements.
- Converting the tuples to sets allows for efficient computation of the intersection.
- Converting the result back to a tuple ensures that the output is in the required format.
- The function handles edge cases such as when one or both of the input tuples are empty by returning an empty tuple, which is consistent with the problem description.

Since the function behaves as described and correctly implements the logic to find shared elements between two tuples, the program is correct.
