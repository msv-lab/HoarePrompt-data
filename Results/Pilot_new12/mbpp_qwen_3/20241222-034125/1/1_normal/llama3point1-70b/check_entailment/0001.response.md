Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two tuples and returns them as a tuple. Given the problem description to find the shared elements from the given two lists (tuples in Python), the function uses a set intersection operation (`&`) which accurately identifies common elements. Since the function works for any pair of tuples without any missing logic or edge cases that come to mind, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
