Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies shared elements between two tuples and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as empty tuples by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the problem description to find shared elements from two lists (tuples). Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
