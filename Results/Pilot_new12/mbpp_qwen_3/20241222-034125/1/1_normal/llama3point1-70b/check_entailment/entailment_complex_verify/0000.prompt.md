You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `set` to find the intersection of the two tuples and then converts it back to a `tuple`. While this approach generally works for finding shared elements, there is a potential issue when the input tuples contain unhashable elements such as lists or dictionaries. In such cases, converting them to sets will raise a `TypeError`.

For example, consider the following input:

```python
test_tup1 = ([1, 2], 3)
test_tup2 = (3, [1, 2])
```

The program will fail because the elements `[1, 2]` are unhashable and cannot be added to a set.

To handle this, you would need to check the types of the elements in the tuples and ensure they are hashable before converting them to sets. Since the provided program does not handle this edge case, it is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as parameters. It computes the intersection of these two tuples by converting them into sets, finding the common elements, and then converting the result back into a tuple. The function returns a tuple containing the common elements found in both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. If there are no common elements, an empty tuple is returned. Edge cases include when one or both of the input tuples are empty, in which case the function still correctly returns an empty tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
