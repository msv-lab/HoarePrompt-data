Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find shared elements from two given tuples. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as input and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements from both tuples. This is achieved by converting each tuple to a set using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`, finding the intersection of these sets using the `&` operator, and then converting the resulting set back to a tuple. Since the problem description asks for the shared elements from two lists (which are represented as tuples in Python), this implementation satisfies the requirement for all potential cases, assuming valid inputs as stated in the guidelines.
