Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two tuples and returns them as a tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function converts the input tuples to sets to find the intersection and then converts the result back to a tuple. This approach is correct for finding shared elements and handles edge cases such as empty tuples appropriately by returning an empty tuple. The function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
