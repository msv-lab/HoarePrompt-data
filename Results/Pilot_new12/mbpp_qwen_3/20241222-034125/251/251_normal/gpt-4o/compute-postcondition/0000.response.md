The code calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin (0,0) to the point `(x, y)` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This means that the value of `r` is derived from the values of `x` and `y`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)**
