Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates of a point. It calculates the distance `r` from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle `theta` in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. The function then returns these two values, `r` and `theta`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If both `x` and `y` are zero, `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` will still calculate correctly, resulting in `r = 0`.
2. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function correctly handles the quadrant of the point (x, y), ensuring that `theta` is calculated properly even when `x` is zero or negative. However, it's worth noting that `theta` is in the range \([-π, π]\), so if the point is directly on the negative y-axis, `theta` will be -π rather than π.**

The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the distance `r` and the angle `theta` for the given point (x, y).**
