The code `theta = math.atan2(y, x)` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian coordinate system. The function `math.atan2(y, x)` returns the arc tangent (measured in radians) of `y / x`, taking into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant.

In the initial state, `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and `r` is defined as \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). After executing the code, `theta` is assigned the value of the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`.

Therefore, the updated variables are:
- `x` remains the same
- `y` remains the same
- `r` remains the same (since it is defined independently of `theta`)
- `theta` is now the angle in radians corresponding to the point `(x, y)`

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\); `theta` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`**
