Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the distance `r` from the origin to the point using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the angle `theta` in radians between the positive x-axis and the point using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. The function returns these two values, `r` and `theta`.

The provided assertions test different sets of input values, and the results match the expected polar coordinates, confirming that the function works correctly for those cases. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases or additional requirements beyond converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, the program meets all the necessary conditions to be considered correct.
