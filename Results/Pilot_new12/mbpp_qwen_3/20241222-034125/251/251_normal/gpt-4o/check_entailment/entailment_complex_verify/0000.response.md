Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The annotations confirm that the function calculates the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using the formula `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which returns the correct angle in the range `(-π, π]`. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function for the given inputs. The annotated version supports the correctness by clearly explaining the state of the program at different points and confirming that the formulas used are accurate. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
