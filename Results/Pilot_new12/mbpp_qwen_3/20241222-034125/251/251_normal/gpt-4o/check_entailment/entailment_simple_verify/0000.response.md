Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The function calculates the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using the formula `theta = math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the correct angle in the range `(-π, π]`. The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. 

The annotated version supports this by clearly stating that `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and the function returns `r` which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and `theta` which is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. Given that the code performs these calculations accurately and the test cases validate this, the program meets the problem description.
