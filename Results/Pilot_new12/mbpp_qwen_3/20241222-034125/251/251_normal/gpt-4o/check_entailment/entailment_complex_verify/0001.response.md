Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)` using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \). The annotated version confirms that the function calculates the radius `r` and the angle `theta` as intended. The test cases provided also validate the correctness of the function for different scenarios. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment is correct.
