Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The function `func_1` calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle `θ` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which handles the correct quadrant determination for the angle.

The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints:
- For the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, although the code won't compute `θ` (since `atan2(0, 0)` is undefined), the problem description and the provided assertions do not include this specific edge case. The function will return `(0.0, 0.0)` in this scenario, which is technically correct as `r` is zero.
- The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including points in various quadrants and on the axes, which the code handles correctly.

Since the code works as expected for the given examples and there are no other edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description where the code fails, the program is correct.
