Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). The function `func_1` takes two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle `theta` in radians using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which returns the correct angle considering the signs of both `x` and `y`.

The function then returns a tuple containing `r` and `theta`. The provided test cases assert the correctness of the function for different sets of input values, confirming that the implementation satisfies the problem description. Since the program handles the conversion accurately and returns the expected results, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
