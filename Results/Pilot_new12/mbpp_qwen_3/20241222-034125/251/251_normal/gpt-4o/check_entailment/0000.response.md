Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The function calculates the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and the angle `theta` using the formula `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which returns the correct angle in the range `(-π, π]`. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the formulas used are accurate, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
