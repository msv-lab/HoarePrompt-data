Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It handles the calculation of the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle \( \theta \) using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which takes into account the correct quadrant for the angle. The code also handles the case where both \( x \) and \( y \) are zero, which would result in a radius of zero and an angle of 0 radians. Given the assertions and the problem description, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
