Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for the radius and \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \) for the angle. The output hints confirm that the function handles the general case where both \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, and the provided assertions verify its correctness for various inputs, including non-zero values. While the output hints mention potential edge cases such as when both \( x \) and \( y \) are zero, the original assessment correctly states that there do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Since we are assuming valid inputs, the function is correct according to the given criteria.
