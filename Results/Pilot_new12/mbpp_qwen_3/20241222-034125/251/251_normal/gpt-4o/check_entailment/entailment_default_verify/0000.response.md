Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for the radius and `math.atan2(y, x)` for the angle `theta`. The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts two real numbers and returns the radius and angle as expected. Although the output hints mention a potential edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero, this is handled correctly by `math.sqrt(0)`, which returns 0, and `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0, indicating the angle is undefined but still correctly computed as 0 radians (as per the behavior of `math.atan2`). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
