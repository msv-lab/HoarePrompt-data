Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The function uses the formulas `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` for the radius and `theta = atan2(y, x)` for the angle. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and yield the expected results. There does not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
