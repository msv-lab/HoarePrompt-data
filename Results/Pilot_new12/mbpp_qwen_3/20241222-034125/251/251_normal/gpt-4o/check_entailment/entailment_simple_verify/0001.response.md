Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle \( \theta \) using the formula \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \). The provided test cases also confirm that the function returns the expected results. Since the annotated version supports the correctness of the function and the test cases align with the problem description, the original assessment is maintained.
