The code `r = math.hypot(x, y)` calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y), which is represented by the variable `r`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y)**.
