`phi` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `r` remains the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y); `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y); `phi` is math.atan2(y, x)**
