The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function returns these two values, `r` and `phi`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function correctly computes both the distance and the angle for any real number inputs `x` and `y`.
