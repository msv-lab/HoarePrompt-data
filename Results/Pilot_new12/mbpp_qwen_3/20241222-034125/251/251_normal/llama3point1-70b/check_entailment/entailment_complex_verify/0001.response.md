Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. The `math.hypot(x, y)` function computes the Euclidean norm, which is the radial distance `r` in polar coordinates, and `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis. The annotated version confirms that the function returns the Euclidean distance `r` and the angle `phi` for any real number inputs `x` and `y`, without mentioning any edge cases that require special handling. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
