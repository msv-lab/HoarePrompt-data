Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. The `math.hypot(x, y)` function computes the Euclidean norm (hypotenuse), which is the radial distance `r` in polar coordinates. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function computes the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis, which is the correct way to determine the angle in polar coordinates. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or input that would cause this function to fail based on the standard behavior of these mathematical functions.
