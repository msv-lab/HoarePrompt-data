Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function returns these two values, `r` and `phi`.

- The function correctly uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to compute the Euclidean distance `r`.
- The function correctly uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle `phi`.

Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases that need special handling, and the provided function handles the general case of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, the program is correct.
