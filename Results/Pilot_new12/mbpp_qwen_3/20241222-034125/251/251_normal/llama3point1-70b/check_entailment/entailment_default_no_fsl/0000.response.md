Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)` using the formulas `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and `phi = atan2(y, x)`. The function handles all potential cases as `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` are well-defined for all real number inputs `x` and `y`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that require special handling. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case.
