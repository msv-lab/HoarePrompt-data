Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†) using `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius \( r \) and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle \( \phi \). The annotated version of the code supports this by explaining that `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `phi` is the angle which is calculated by `math.atan2(y, x)`. Given that the problem description asks for a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and the code and annotations clearly show this functionality, the original assessment is accurate.
