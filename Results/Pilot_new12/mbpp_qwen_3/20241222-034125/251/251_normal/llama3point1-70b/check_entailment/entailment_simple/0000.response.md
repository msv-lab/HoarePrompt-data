Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates. It does this by:

1. Importing the `math` module, which contains the necessary functions (`hypot` and `atan2`) for performing the conversion.
2. Defining a function `func_1(x, y)` that takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input, which represent the rectangular coordinates.
3. Calculating the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using `math.hypot(x, y)`. This function computes \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), which is the radius in polar coordinates.
4. Calculating the angle `phi` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This function correctly handles the quadrant of the angle.
5. Returning both `r` and `phi` as the result.

Since the program correctly performs the required conversion and does not have any conditions that would fail to meet the problem description under valid inputs, it is correct according to the given problem description.
