Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \phi)\). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radial distance \(r\) from the origin to the point \((x, y)\), and `math.atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle \(\phi\) with respect to the positive x-axis. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that need special handling. The function works for any real number inputs \(x\) and \(y\), and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
