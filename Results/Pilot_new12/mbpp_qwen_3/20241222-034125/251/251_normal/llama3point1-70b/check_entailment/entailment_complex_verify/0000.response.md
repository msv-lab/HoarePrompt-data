Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The annotations indicate that the function calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point (x, y) using `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle `phi` with respect to the positive x-axis using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The annotations also mention that there are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling, implying that the function handles all valid real number inputs correctly. Since the original assessment concluded that the function is correct and the annotations support this conclusion, the original assessment remains accurate.
