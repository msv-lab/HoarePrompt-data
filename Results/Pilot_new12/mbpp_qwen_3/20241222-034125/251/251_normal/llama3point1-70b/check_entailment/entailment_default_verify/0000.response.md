Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) using the appropriate mathematical functions `math.hypot` and `math.atan2`. The output hints confirm that the function handles valid inputs correctly and computes both the radius `r` and the angle `φ` accurately. Since the problem description asks to write a function for this conversion and there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that the function does not handle, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
