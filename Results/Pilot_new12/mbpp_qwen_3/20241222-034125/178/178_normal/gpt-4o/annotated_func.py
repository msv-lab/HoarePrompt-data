#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result which is the value of total_sum * len(numbers) where total_sum is the sum of the elements in rounded_numbers and rounded_numbers is a list of rounded values of the numbers in numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats), rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the original list, and returns the resulting value. The function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, but the function works correctly for empty lists, as the sum of an empty list is 0, and the result will be 0 regardless of the length.
