Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats), rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the original list, and returns the resulting value. The function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, but the function works correctly for empty lists, as the sum of an empty list is 0, and the result will be 0 regardless of the length.**

This summary covers the functionality based on the actual code and ensures that all potential cases, including handling an empty list, are addressed.
