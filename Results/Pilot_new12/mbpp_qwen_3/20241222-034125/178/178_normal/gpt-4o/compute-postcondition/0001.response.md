`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`. The elements in `rounded_numbers` are the rounded values of the corresponding elements in `numbers`. However, the specific values of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `total_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the numbers in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`**
