The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats). After processing the input, the function returns the value of `total_sum * len(numbers)`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` and `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the numbers in `numbers`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers, round each number in the list, calculate the sum of the rounded numbers, multiply it by the length of the original list, and return the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, rounds each number in the list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, multiplies it by the length of the original list, and returns the result.**
