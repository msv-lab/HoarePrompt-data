Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (both integers and floats) as input.
2. **Rounding Numbers**: It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
4. **Result Calculation**: It multiplies the sum by the length of the original list.
5. **Return Value**: The function returns the final calculated value.

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including lists with positive and negative numbers, as well as lists with mixed data types (though the function only processes the numerical values).

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the program correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
