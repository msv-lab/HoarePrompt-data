Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles both positive and negative numbers, floating-point numbers, and even empty lists by returning 0. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the problem description and the assertions provided in the code validate its correctness. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
