Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer, sums these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. The function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers. The output hints and the provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly for various scenarios, including edge cases like empty lists (the sum of an empty list is 0, and multiplying by the length also results in 0). Since the function does not fail for any of the provided test cases and follows the problem description accurately, the program is correct.
