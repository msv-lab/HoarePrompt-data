Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with positive and negative floating-point numbers and integers. The annotated version clearly describes the steps taken by the function and supports the correctness of the implementation. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations validate its correctness, the original assessment is valid.
