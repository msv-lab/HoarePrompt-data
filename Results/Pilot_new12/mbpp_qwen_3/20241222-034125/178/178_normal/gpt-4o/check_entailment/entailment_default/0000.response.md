Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the original list. The function works correctly for all the provided test cases and handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers. Additionally, the function returns the correct result even when the list is empty, as the sum of an empty list is 0, and multiplying by the length of the list (which is also 0) results in 0. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case within the given constraints.
