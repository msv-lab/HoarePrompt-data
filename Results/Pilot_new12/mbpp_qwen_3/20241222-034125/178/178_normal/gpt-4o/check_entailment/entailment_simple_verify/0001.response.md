Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with positive and negative floating-point numbers, integers, and a mix of both. Given the logic implemented and the successful assertions, the function meets the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is justified.
