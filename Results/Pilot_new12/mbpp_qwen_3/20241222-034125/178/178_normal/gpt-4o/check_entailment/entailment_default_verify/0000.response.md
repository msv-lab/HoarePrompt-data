Final: **True**

Reasoning: The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers, and works correctly for empty lists. The provided assertions match the described functionality of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
