Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` rounds each number in the given list and then calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, multiplying this sum by the length of the list. The provided assertions match the expected behavior of the function, and the annotations confirm that the function works as intended for the given problem description. The function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers, and there are no issues with handling empty lists or other edge cases based on the provided information. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
