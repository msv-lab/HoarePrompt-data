The code snippet creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in the `numbers` list. Since the exact values of `numbers` are not specified, we'll keep them as they are but note that each element in `numbers` will be replaced by its rounded value in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`.**
