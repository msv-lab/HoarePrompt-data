Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of floating-point or integer numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. This process covers all potential inputs, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with very large or small numbers, and lists containing both positive and negative values. The function does not perform any operations outside of the provided code and adheres strictly to the described steps.**
