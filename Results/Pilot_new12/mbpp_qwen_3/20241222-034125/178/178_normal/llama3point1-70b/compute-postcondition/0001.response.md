`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`. The values of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
