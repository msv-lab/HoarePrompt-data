Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Accepts a List of Numbers**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of floating-point or integer numbers.

2. **Rounding Each Number**: It creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded version of the corresponding element in the input list using a list comprehension. The rounding is done using the built-in `round()` function.

3. **Calculating the Sum**: It calculates the sum of the elements in the `rounded_numbers` list using the `sum()` function.

4. **Multiplying by Length**: It multiplies the sum by the length of the original `numbers` list (`len(numbers)`).

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, it returns the result of the multiplication.

The program adheres to the specified steps without any additional or missing operations. It handles various types of input (positive, negative, large, small, and even empty lists), although it assumes the input is valid as per the given instructions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
