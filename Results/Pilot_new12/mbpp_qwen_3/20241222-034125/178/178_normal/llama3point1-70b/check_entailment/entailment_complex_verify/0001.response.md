Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the input list and then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, finally multiplying the sum by the length of the list. This aligns with the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function handles various cases, including empty lists and lists with positive, negative, and very large or small numbers. The function does not perform any operations outside of the provided code and adheres strictly to the described steps. Therefore, the program is correct.
