Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function according to the problem description. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the original list. The output hints confirm that the function adheres to the specified steps and handles all potential inputs, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with very large or small numbers, and lists containing both positive and negative values. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
