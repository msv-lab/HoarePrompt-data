Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly performs the required operations. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. The annotated version confirms that the function handles all potential inputs, including edge cases such as empty lists, very large or small numbers, and lists containing both positive and negative values. Since the code aligns perfectly with the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
