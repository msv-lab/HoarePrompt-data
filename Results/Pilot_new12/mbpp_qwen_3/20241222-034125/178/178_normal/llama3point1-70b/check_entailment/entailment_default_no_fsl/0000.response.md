Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the original list, and returns the result. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential inputs, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with very large or small numbers, and lists containing both positive and negative values. Since the code strictly follows the problem description and handles all mentioned cases, the program is correct.
