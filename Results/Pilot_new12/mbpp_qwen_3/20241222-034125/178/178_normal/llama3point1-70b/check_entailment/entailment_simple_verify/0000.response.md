Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list and calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, starting from the initial state where `numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers, through the rounding process, sum calculation, and finally returning the result. There are no missing logic or edge cases indicated in the annotations that suggest the function is not meeting the problem description.
