Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including empty lists and lists with very large or small numbers, without requiring any additional checks. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
