Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the input list using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential cases, including empty lists, lists with very large or small numbers, and lists containing both positive and negative values. There are no issues with the logic or functionality of the provided code that would contradict the original assessment. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
