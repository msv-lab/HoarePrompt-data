Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the input list and then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, finally multiplying the sum by the length of the list. This aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. Since the function handles both positive and negative numbers and works correctly for lists of any length (including empty lists), it meets the requirements without any issues. Therefore, the program is correct.
