Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. This precisely matches the problem description of rounding every number in a given list and printing the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The annotations do not indicate any deviations from this behavior, and the original assessment is supported by the provided annotated version. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
