Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing an XOR operation on the two numbers and then checking if the result is a power of 2. The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic using the expression `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` to determine if `xor_result` is a power of 2. The assertions provided cover various cases, including when the numbers differ at exactly one bit position and when they do not. The function handles these cases appropriately, and the edge cases mentioned in the output hints are also covered. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
