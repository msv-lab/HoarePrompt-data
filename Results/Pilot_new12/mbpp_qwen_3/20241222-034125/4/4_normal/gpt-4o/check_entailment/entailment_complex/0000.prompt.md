You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #`The program returns True if xor_result is a power of 2, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their XOR, and checks if the result is a power of 2. If the result is a power of 2, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Edge Cases:
- If both `a` and `b` are zero (`a = 0` and `b = 0`), the XOR result will be `0`, which is not a power of 2, so the function returns `False`.
- If either `a` or `b` is zero and the other is a power of 2, the XOR result will be the non-zero value, which is a power of 2, so the function returns `True`.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function checks if `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` to determine if `xor_result` is a power of 2. This is correct, but it should be noted that this condition alone is sufficient to determine if `xor_result` is a power of 2, so the additional check `xor_result != 0` is redundant.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
