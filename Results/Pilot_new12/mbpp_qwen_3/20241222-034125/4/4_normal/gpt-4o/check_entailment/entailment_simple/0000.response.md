Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **XOR Operation**: 
   - The XOR operation (`^`) between two numbers `a` and `b` produces a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different, and 0 if they are the same.
   - For example:
     - `13 (1101)_2` and `9 (1001)_2` -> `13 ^ 9 = 0100 (4)_2`
     - `15 (1111)_2` and `8 (1000)_2` -> `15 ^ 8 = 0111 (7)_2`

2. **Power of Two Check**:
   - The function then checks if the result of the XOR operation (`xor_result`) is a power of two.
   - A number is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one bit set to 1.
   - To check this, the function uses the expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`.
     - This works because subtracting 1 from a power of two flips all the bits after the single set bit, making the AND operation result zero.
     - For example:
       - `4 (100)_2` -> `4 - 1 = 3 (011)_2` -> `4 & 3 = 0`
       - `7 (111)_2` -> `7 - 1 = 6 (110)_2` -> `7 & 6 = 6` (not zero)

3. **Assertions Verification**:
   - The provided assertions cover various cases:
     - `func_1(13, 9)` should be `True` because `13 ^ 9 = 4`, which is a power of two.
     - `func_1(15, 8)` should be `False` because `15 ^ 8 = 7`, which is not a power of two.
     - `func_1(2, 4)` should be `False` because `2 ^ 4 = 6`, which is not a power of two.
     - `func_1(2, 3)` should be `True` because `2 ^ 3 = 1`, which is a power of two.
     - `func_1(5, 1)` should be `True` because `5 ^ 1 = 4`, which is a power of two.
     - `func_1(1, 5)` should be `True` because `1 ^ 5 = 4`, which is a power of two.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the assertions cover all necessary scenarios, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
