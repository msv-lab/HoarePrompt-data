Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function computes the XOR of the two numbers and then checks if the result is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This condition is sufficient to determine if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1, which is equivalent to the numbers differing at exactly one bit position.

Given the problem description and the test cases provided, the function works correctly for all the cases mentioned, including edge cases like when both numbers are zero. The additional check `xor_result != 0` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the function. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
