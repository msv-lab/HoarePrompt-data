Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if the XOR result is a power of 2, indicating exactly one bit is set to 1. All provided test cases validate this behavior. The function handles valid non-negative integer inputs as expected and meets the problem description without any issues. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
