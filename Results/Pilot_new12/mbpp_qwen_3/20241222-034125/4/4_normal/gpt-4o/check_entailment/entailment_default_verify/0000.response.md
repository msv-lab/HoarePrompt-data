Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and then checking if the result is a power of 2. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including the edge cases where both numbers are zero and where one number is zero and the other is a power of 2. The function behaves as expected in all these cases. The output hints also confirm that the function checks if the XOR result is a power of 2, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
