Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether two non-negative integers `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **XOR Calculation**: The function first computes the XOR of `a` and `b` using `xor_result = a ^ b`. The XOR operation results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different, and 0 if they are the same.

2. **Power of 2 Check**: The function then checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, `1 (binary: 0001)`, `2 (binary: 0010)`, `4 (binary: 0100)`, etc., all satisfy this condition. The expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1)` will be zero if `xor_result` is a power of 2 because subtracting 1 from a power of 2 flips all the bits after the single 1 bit (which makes them all 1s) and the bitwise AND with the original number results in zero.

3. **Non-Zero Check**: Although the annotation mentions the additional check `xor_result != 0`, this condition is redundant because the XOR of two numbers differing at exactly one bit will never be zero. If the XOR were zero, it would mean that `a` and `b` have the same bits in all positions, which contradicts the requirement of differing at exactly one bit.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are zero, the XOR result is `0`, which is not a power of 2, so the function returns `False`.
   - If either `a` or `b` is zero and the other is a power of 2, the XOR result will be the non-zero value, which is a power of 2, so the function returns `True`.

5. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test various cases, including differing at one bit, differing at more than one bit, and being the same (zero result). The function passes these tests, confirming its correctness.

Since the function accurately checks whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by ensuring the XOR result is a power of 2 and handles all edge cases as described, the program is correct according to the problem description.
