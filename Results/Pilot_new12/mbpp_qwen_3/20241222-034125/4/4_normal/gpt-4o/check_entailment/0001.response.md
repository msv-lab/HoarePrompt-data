Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used is sound:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, the result will have exactly one '1' bit.
2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if the XOR result has exactly one '1' bit. This works because subtracting 1 from a number with a single '1' bit in its binary representation flips all the bits following that '1' bit (including the '1' bit itself), and then the AND operation results in zero.

Given the test cases provided, the function passes all the assertions, and the logic appears to cover the necessary conditions. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make this function incorrect based on the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
