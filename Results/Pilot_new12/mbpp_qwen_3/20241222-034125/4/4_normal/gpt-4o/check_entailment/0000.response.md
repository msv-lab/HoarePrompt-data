Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers. If the result has exactly one bit set to 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

The function first calculates the XOR result using `a ^ b`. Then it checks two conditions:
1. The XOR result should not be zero (`xor_result != 0`), which ensures that there is at least one differing bit.
2. The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1. This works because subtracting 1 from a number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit (including the rightmost set bit itself), and the bitwise AND of the original number and the number with its rightmost set bit cleared results in zero if there is only one set bit.

All the provided test cases confirm that the function works as intended. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would make the function return an incorrect result based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
