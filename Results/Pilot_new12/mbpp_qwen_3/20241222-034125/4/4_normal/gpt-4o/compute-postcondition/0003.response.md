Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their XOR, and checks if the result is a power of 2. If the result is a power of 2, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Edge Cases:
- If both `a` and `b` are zero (`a = 0` and `b = 0`), the XOR result will be `0`, which is not a power of 2, so the function returns `False`.
- If either `a` or `b` is zero and the other is a power of 2, the XOR result will be the non-zero value, which is a power of 2, so the function returns `True`.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the function checks if `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` to determine if `xor_result` is a power of 2. This is correct, but it should be noted that this condition alone is sufficient to determine if `xor_result` is a power of 2, so the additional check `xor_result != 0` is redundant.**

This ensures that the function correctly identifies whether the XOR of two non-negative integers is a power of 2, handling all edge cases and performing only necessary operations.**
