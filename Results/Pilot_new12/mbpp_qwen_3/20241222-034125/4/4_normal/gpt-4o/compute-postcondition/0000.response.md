`xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`. The caret (^) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, the value of `xor_result` will also be a non-negative integer resulting from the XOR operation.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `xor_result` is a non-negative integer equal to `a ^ b`**
