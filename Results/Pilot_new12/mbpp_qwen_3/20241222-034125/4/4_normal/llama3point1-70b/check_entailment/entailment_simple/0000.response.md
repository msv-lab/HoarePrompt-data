Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. Here's why:

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. In binary representation, this operation results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` are different, and 0 if they are the same.

2. **Counting '1' Bits**: The function uses the `bin()` function to convert the result of the XOR operation into its binary string representation. The `.count('1')` method counts the number of '1' bits in this binary string.

3. **Condition Check**: The function returns `True` if the count of '1' bits is exactly 1, indicating that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given these points, the function accurately fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
