Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers. The result is then converted to a binary string, and the number of '1's is counted using the `count` method. If the count is exactly 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This approach works correctly for all potential cases, as it accurately determines whether the two numbers have exactly one differing bit. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
