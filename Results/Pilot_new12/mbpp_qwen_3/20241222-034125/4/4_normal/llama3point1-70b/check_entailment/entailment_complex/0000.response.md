Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, computes their bitwise XOR, and then checks if the result has exactly one '1' bit. This is achieved using the `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1` expression, which returns `True` if the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of the XOR result is exactly one, and `False` otherwise.

The program handles all valid cases according to the problem description. It correctly identifies when the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position and returns the appropriate boolean value. The edge cases mentioned in the comments (such as when both numbers are zero) are implicitly handled because the XOR of two zeros results in zero, which has no '1' bits, thus returning `False`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description for all valid inputs, the correctness is **True**.
