Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1' bits in the result. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1' bit, which aligns with the problem description. Although the annotated version mentions potential edge cases, the function does not handle them explicitly, but the original problem description does not specify how to handle these cases. Therefore, based on the given information, the function meets the problem description and is correct.
