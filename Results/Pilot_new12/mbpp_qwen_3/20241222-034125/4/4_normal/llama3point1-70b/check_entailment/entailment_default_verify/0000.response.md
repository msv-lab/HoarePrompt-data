Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment correctly describes the function's logic and expected behavior, it fails to consider edge cases where the inputs are zero. The function `func_1` does not handle scenarios where both inputs are zero, which should be considered a special case. When both `num1` and `num2` are zero, their bitwise XOR is zero, and the function will return `False`, even though they "differ" at zero positions (which is technically correct but might be misleading depending on the problem's context). To accurately determine whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the function should explicitly handle this edge case. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate, and the final assessment is **False**.
