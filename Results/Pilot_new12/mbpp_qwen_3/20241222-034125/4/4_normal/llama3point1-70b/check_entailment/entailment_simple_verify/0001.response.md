Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation (`^`). The bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` sets the bits to 1 where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. By converting the result to a binary string and counting the number of '1's, the function determines if there is exactly one differing bit. The function returns `True` if and only if this count is exactly 1, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected under the given conditions.
