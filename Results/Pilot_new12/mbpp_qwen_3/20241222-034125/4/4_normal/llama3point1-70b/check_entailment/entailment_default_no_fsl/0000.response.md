Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the edge case where both `num1` and `num2` are zero. In this scenario, the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` would also be zero, which has no '1' bits. Therefore, the function would return `False`, even though the two numbers do not differ at exactly one bit position (since they are identical). This contradicts the problem description, which states that the function should return `True` if the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Thus, the code is not correct for every potential case.
