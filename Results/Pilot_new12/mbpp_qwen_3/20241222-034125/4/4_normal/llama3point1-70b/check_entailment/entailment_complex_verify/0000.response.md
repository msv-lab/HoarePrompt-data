Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position. The function performs a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers, converts the result to a binary string, and counts the number of '1' bits. If the count is exactly one, it returns `True`, indicating that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected under the given conditions. While the annotated version mentions potential edge cases (e.g., when either or both of the inputs are zero), the original problem description does not explicitly require handling these edge cases, and the function correctly identifies such scenarios as failing the condition (i.e., returning `False`). Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
