You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are non-negative integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1' bit, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `num1` and `num2`. It computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`, then counts the number of '1' bits in the result. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2` produces a result with precisely one '1' bit. Potential edge cases include when either or both of the inputs are zero, which would not result in a single '1' bit in the XOR result unless the other input is also zero but differs in exactly one bit position. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, so the function will return `False` in such scenarios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
