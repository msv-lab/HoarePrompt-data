You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers. The result is then converted to a binary string, and the number of '1's is counted using the `count` method. If the count is exactly 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This approach works correctly for all potential cases, as it accurately determines whether the two numbers have exactly one differing bit. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `num1` and `num2`. It computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`, then counts the number of '1' bits in the result. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2` produces a result with precisely one '1' bit. Potential edge cases include when either or both of the inputs are zero, which would not result in a single '1' bit in the XOR result unless the other input is also zero but differs in exactly one bit position. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, so the function will return `False` in such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
