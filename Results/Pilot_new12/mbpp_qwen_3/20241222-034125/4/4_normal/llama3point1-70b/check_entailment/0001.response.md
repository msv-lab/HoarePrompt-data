Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This is achieved by using the XOR operation (`^`) between the two numbers, which sets the bits to 1 where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. Converting the result to a binary string and counting the number of '1's gives the number of differing bits. The function returns `True` if and only if this count is exactly 1, which satisfies the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs where this logic would fail based on the given problem statement.
