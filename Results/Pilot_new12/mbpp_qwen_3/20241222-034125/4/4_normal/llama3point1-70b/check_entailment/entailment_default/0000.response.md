Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs a bitwise XOR operation on them, and then counts the number of '1' bits in the result using the `bin()` function followed by `.count('1')`. If the count is exactly one, it returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. For all potential cases where the input is valid and non-negative integers, the function works as expected. The output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly for all such cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
