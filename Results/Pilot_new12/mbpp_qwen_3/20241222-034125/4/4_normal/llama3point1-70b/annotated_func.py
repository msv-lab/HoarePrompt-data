#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are non-negative integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1' bit, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `num1` and `num2`. It computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`, then counts the number of '1' bits in the result. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function checks whether the bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2` produces a result with precisely one '1' bit. Potential edge cases include when either or both of the inputs are zero, which would not result in a single '1' bit in the XOR result unless the other input is also zero but differs in exactly one bit position. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly, so the function will return `False` in such scenarios.
