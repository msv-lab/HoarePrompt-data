The code `frequency[digit] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary by 1. However, the value of `digit` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that the value associated with `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `digit_str` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `digit` is increased by 1.**
