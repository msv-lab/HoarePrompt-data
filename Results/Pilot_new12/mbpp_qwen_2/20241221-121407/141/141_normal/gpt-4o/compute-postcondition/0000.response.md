`n` is converted to a string and stored in the variable `digit_str`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`**
