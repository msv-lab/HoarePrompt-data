Postcondition: ***`digit_str` is an empty string, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `frequency` contains at least one key-value pair. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `digit_str`, `n`, `frequency`, and `count` remains less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.***
