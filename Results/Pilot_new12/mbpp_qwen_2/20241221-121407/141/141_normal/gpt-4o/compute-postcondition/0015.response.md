Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string with the first character removed, and `frequency` is a dictionary that has been updated with the count of the first character of `digit_str`. Specifically, if `digit` (the first character of `digit_str`) was already in `frequency`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1.***
