The code increments the value associated with the key `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary by 1. Since the `digit` is already present as a key in the `frequency` dictionary, the value corresponding to this key will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and `digit_str`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with the value of the key `digit` increased by 1.**
