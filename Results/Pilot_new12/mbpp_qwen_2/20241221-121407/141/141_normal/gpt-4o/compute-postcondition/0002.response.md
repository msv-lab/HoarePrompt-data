According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must contain at least one character because the loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `frequency` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

Before the loop starts, `digit_str` should be checked to ensure it contains at least one character. If `digit_str` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

1. `n` is a non-negative integer (this remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop execution directly).
2. `digit_str` must be a non-empty string (it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute).
3. `frequency` is an empty dictionary `{}` (this remains unchanged).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is an empty dictionary {}**
