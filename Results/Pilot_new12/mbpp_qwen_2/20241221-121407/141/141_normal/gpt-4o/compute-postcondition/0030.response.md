Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input. It first converts `n` to a string and counts the frequency of each digit in `n`. After counting the frequencies, it checks each digit's frequency against the digit itself. If for any digit, its frequency is greater than the digit itself, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function covers all possible cases for the input `n`, returning `False` if any digit's frequency exceeds the digit itself, and `True` only if no such digit exists.**

This summary accurately reflects the actual functionality of the function based on the provided code, including the potential edge cases and ensuring that the annotations are aligned with the code's behavior.
