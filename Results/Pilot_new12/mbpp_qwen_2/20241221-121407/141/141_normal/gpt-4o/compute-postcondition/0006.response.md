The code snippet increments the count of the digit in the `frequency` dictionary. Initially, `digit` is not in the `frequency` dictionary, so the line `frequency[digit] = 1` adds the key `digit` with the value `1`. The values of `n`, `digit_str`, and `frequency` (except for the new entry) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with one entry `{digit: 1}`, `digit` is not in the `frequency` dictionary before the code was run**
