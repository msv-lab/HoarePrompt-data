According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string `digit_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must still be non-empty. If `digit_str` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` is a non-empty string.
2. For the loop to execute again, `digit_str` must still contain at least one character.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `digit_str` remains a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, and `frequency` is a dictionary**
