The code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency`. This does not affect the value of `n` or `digit_str`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`; `frequency` is an empty dictionary {}**
