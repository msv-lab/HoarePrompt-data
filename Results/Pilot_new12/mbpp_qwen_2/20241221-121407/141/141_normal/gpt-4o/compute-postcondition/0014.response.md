The code updates the `frequency` dictionary by setting the value of `frequency[digit]` to 1. The `digit` here refers to the last character of `digit_str` since the first character of `digit_str` has been removed. The initial state is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, and `frequency` is a dictionary with counts of previously processed digits.

The impact of the code is that the frequency of the last character in `digit_str` (which is now the first character of `digit_str`) is set to 1 in the `frequency` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string with the first character removed, `frequency` is a dictionary that has been updated with the count of the previously processed digit, and `frequency[digit]` is 1, where `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`.**
