Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `digit_str` is an empty string.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each item `(digit, count)` in the dictionary `frequency`.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `count <= int(digit)` must hold true.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `digit_str` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted, so it is still an empty string.
   - `n` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted, so it is still a non-negative integer.
   - `frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next key-value pair `(digit, count)` from the dictionary `frequency` must be processed.
   - The new `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `digit_str` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair.
   - `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`.

Given that the loop continues based on the current key-value pair `(digit, count)` and the next key-value pair `(new_digit, new_count)` needs to satisfy the condition `new_count <= int(new_digit)`, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `digit_str` is an empty string.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`.

Since the exact values of `digit` and `count` are not specified, we can only describe the general conditions that must hold true for the next iteration.

State: **`digit_str` is an empty string, `n` is a non-negative integer, `frequency` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `count` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`.**
