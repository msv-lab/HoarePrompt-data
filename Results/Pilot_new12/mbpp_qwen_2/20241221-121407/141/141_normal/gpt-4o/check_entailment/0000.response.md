Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and then verifies the condition. Based on the provided assertions and the logic of the function, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
