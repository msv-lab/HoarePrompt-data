Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and verifies the condition. The provided assertions also support the correctness of the function. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, and there are no discrepancies or issues identified that would lead to a different assessment. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
