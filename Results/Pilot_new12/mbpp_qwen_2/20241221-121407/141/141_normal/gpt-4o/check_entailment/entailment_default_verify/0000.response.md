Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and then checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. The provided output hints and the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected and handles all given cases correctly. Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic aligns with the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
