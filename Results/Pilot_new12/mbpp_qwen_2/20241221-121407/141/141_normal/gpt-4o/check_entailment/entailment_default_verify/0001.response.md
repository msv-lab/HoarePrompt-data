Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The provided output hints confirm that the function converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and verifies if the frequency of any digit exceeds the digit itself. The function handles all the test cases and edge cases correctly, as evidenced by the provided assertions and the explanation. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
