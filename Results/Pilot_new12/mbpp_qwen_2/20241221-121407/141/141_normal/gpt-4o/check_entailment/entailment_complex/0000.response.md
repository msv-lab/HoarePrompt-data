Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single non-negative integer `n` as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Digit Frequency Calculation**: The program converts the integer `n` into a string (`digit_str`) and then iterates through each character (digit) in this string to calculate the frequency of each digit. This part ensures that the frequency of each digit is counted correctly.

3. **Frequency Check**: After calculating the frequency of each digit, the program checks if the frequency of any digit is greater than the digit itself. If it finds any such digit, it immediately returns `False`. If all digits pass this check, it returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles all edge cases where the frequency of a digit does not exceed the digit itself, including single-digit numbers and repeated digits.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the program correctly validates whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself for all possible inputs (non-negative integers). Therefore, the program is correct.
