Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and then counts the frequency of each digit. It then checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. The code handles all potential cases as described in the output hints and problem description. There are no examples or hints provided that indicate any issues with the implementation. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case.
