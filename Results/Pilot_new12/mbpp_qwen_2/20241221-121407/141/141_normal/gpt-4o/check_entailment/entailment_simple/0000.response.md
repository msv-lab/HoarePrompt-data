Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description Recap**: The function `func_1` should take an integer `n` as input and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function converts the integer `n` to a string (`digit_str`) to facilitate easy iteration over each digit.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `frequency` to keep track of the count of each digit.
   - A loop iterates through each character in `digit_str`, updating the frequency of each digit found.
   - After constructing the frequency dictionary, another loop checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (converted back to an integer).
     - If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function immediately returns `False`.
     - If all checks pass, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, etc.), where the frequency of the digit is inherently less than or equal to itself.
   - For multi-digit numbers, the logic ensures that each digit's frequency does not exceed its value.

4. **Assertions Validated**:
   - `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to the digit itself.
   - `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the digit '5' appears once, which is greater than the digit '5' itself.
   - `func_1(321)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (3, 2, 1) is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Given these points, the program correctly adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, thus the correctness is **True**.
