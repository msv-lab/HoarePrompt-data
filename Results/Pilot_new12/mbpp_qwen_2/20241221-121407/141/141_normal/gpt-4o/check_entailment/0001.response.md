Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this:

1. For `n = 1234`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1: 1 (<= 1)
   - 2: 1 (<= 2)
   - 3: 1 (<= 3)
   - 4: 1 (<= 4)
   The function returns `True`.

2. For `n = 51241`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1: 2 (> 1)
   - 2: 1 (<= 2)
   - 5: 1 (<= 5)
   The function returns `False` because the digit '1' appears twice.

3. For `n = 321`, the digit frequencies are:
   - 1: 1 (<= 1)
   - 2: 1 (<= 2)
   - 3: 1 (<= 3)
   The function returns `True`.

The function handles the examples provided correctly. To ensure the function works for all potential cases, we can consider additional examples:

- For `n = 9876543210`, all digits are valid since their frequencies are all less than or equal to the digit itself.
- For `n = 1111111111`, the digit '1' appears 10 times, which is greater than the digit itself, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- For `n = 0`, the digit '0' appears once, which is valid.

Since the function correctly handles all the examples and potential edge cases, the correctness is `True`.
