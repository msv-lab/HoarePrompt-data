State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` must be the first character in `str_n`** 

### Explanation:
1. The loop iterates over each character in `str_n`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `str_n` must contain at least one character because if `str_n` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `digit` will take the value of the first character in `str_n` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `str_n` has at least one character, and `digit` should be set to the first character in `str_n` to begin the loop iteration.
