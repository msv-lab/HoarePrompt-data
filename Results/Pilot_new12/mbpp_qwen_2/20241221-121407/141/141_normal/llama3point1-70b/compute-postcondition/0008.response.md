Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
  - `n` is a non-negative integer.
  - `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.
  - The count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.
  - If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for digit in str_n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in `str_n`.
2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.
   - The count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

### What Needs to Change:
- After the previous iteration, we need to check if the loop can continue to the next character in `str_n`.
- If the current character is `digit`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` should be incremented.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that the count of `digit` should still be less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

### Adjusted States:
- The `digit` variable will take the next character from `str_n`.
- We need to increment the count of `digit` in `str_n` and check if it still satisfies the condition.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same as it is not being modified by the loop.
- `str_n` remains the same as it is not being modified by the loop.
- The count of `digit` in `str_n` will be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that the new count of `digit` should be less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit` + 1**.

So, the final state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit` + 1**.
