Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of that digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If this condition holds for all digits, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly, and there is no additional action performed outside the loop.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is `0`, the function will return `True` since there are no digits to check.
- If `n` is a single-digit number, the function will return `True` because the count of the digit is equal to the digit itself.
- If `n` is `111`, the function will return `False` because the count of each digit (1) is greater than the digit itself.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no explicit return statements other than `return False` within the loop. This implies that if the loop completes without returning `False`, the function should return `True` implicitly. However, the code as written does not include this implicit return. To clarify, the function should include an implicit return `True` after the loop if no `False` is returned during the iteration.
