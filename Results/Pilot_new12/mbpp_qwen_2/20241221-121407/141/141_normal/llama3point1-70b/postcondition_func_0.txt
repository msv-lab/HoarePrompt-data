The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of that digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If this condition holds for all digits, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly, and there is no additional action performed outside the loop.
