Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks if the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through each digit in the string representation of the input integer `n`, counting the occurrences of each digit, and comparing these counts to the digit values. Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would make the program incorrect, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains accurate.
