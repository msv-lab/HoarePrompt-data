Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's analyze this:

- The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
- It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`.
- For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the digit itself.
- If it finds any digit that violates this condition, it returns `False`.
- If no such digit is found, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement for all potential cases. Here are a few test cases to illustrate:

- For `n = 321`, the digit counts are `3:1`, `2:1`, `1:1`. All conditions `1 <= 1`, `1 <= 1`, `1 <= 1` hold true, so the function returns `True`.
- For `n = 32001`, the digit counts are `3:1`, `2:1`, `0:2`, `1:1`. All conditions `1 <= 1`, `1 <= 1`, `2 <= 0` (which is false), and `1 <= 1` hold true for the valid digits, but the condition for `0` is checked, and it returns `False`.
- For `n = 7331`, the digit counts are `7:1`, `3:2`, `1:1`. All conditions `1 <= 1`, `2 <= 3`, `1 <= 1` hold true, so the function returns `True`.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and no counterexample was found, the function is correct.
