Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n` as input. The problem description specifies that the function should take an integer, which this function does correctly.

2. **String Conversion**: Inside the function, `n` is converted to its string representation using `str(n)`. This step ensures that the function can iterate over each digit in the number, which is necessary to check the frequency of each digit.

3. **Frequency Check**: A `for` loop iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, the function checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` (obtained using `str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (obtained using `int(digit)`). If such a condition is found, the function immediately returns `False`.

4. **Return Logic**: If the loop completes without finding any digit whose frequency exceeds its value, the function returns `True`.

Given these points, the function correctly checks the frequency of each digit in the integer and returns `True` if all digits satisfy the condition that their frequency is less than or equal to their value, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
