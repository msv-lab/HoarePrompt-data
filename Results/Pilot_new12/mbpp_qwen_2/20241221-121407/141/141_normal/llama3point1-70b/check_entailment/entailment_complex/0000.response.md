Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string `str_n`, and iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If it finds any digit whose count exceeds its value, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such digit, the function implicitly returns `True`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it follows the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. **Conversion**: It converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n` to facilitate digit-wise operations.
3. **Iteration and Check**: For each digit in `str_n`, it checks if the count of that digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit.
4. **Immediate Return**: If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False` immediately.
5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function implicitly returns `True`.

Since the program correctly performs these steps, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
