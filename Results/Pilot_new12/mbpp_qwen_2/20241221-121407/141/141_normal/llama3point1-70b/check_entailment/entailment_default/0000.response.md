Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and then iterates through each digit. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit itself. If this condition is violated for any digit, the function returns `False`. If the condition holds for all digits, the function returns `True`.

The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. It correctly checks the frequency of each digit and compares it with the digit's value. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the output hints that suggest the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
