Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code iterates through each digit in the string representation of the input integer `n` and checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If for any digit, the count exceeds the digit value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This approach correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for every potential case, as long as the input is a valid non-negative integer. The code handles all digits and does not miss any cases based on the problem description and the provided hints.
