Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer and checking the digit frequencies without handling explicit edge cases, which aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. No counterexamples or additional edge cases were identified that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
