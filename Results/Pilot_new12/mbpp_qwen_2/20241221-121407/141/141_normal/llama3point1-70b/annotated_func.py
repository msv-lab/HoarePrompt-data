#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`. If for every digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit, the function returns nothing (None). Otherwise, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of that digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If this condition holds for all digits, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly, and there is no additional action performed outside the loop.
