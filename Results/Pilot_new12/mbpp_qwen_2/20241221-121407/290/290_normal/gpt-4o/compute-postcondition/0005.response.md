Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters contains the character 'z'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks if 'z' is present in the middle part of the string (from index 1 to the second last index). If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases where the character 'z' might or might not be present in the specified substring.**

Edge cases:
- If the string `s` is empty (`""`), the function should return `False` since there is no middle part to check.
- If the string `s` has only one character (`"a"`), the function should also return `False` because the substring from index 1 to the second last index is empty.
- If the string `s` has two characters (`"ab"`), the function should return `False` for the same reason.

Missing functionality:
- The provided code does not handle edge cases where the string length is less than 3. Therefore, it implicitly returns `False` for such cases, which is correct based on the problem statement. However, explicitly handling these cases in the documentation would provide clarity.
