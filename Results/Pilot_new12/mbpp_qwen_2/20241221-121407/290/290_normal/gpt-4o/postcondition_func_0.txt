The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters contains the character 'z'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks if 'z' is present in the middle part of the string (from index 1 to the second last index). If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases where the character 'z' might or might not be present in the specified substring.
