Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not check for the presence of 'z' within the string excluding the first and last characters correctly. The issue arises because the function does not handle cases where 'z' is present at the beginning or end of the string. For instance, `func_1('zpythonz')` should return `False` according to the problem description, but the current implementation would incorrectly return `True`. This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
