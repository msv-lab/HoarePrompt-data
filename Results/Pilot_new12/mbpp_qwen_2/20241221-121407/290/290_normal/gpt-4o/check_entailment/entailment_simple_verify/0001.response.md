Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` only checks if 'z' is present in the substring of the string `s` from index 1 to the second last index. However, the problem description requires that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word, meaning 'z' can appear anywhere in the middle of the string except at the beginning and end. The provided test cases `func_1('zpythonz')` should return `False`, but the current implementation returns `True`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
