Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks for the presence of 'z' within the substring of the string `s` excluding the first and last characters. However, the problem description explicitly states that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the requirement that 'z' must not appear at the beginning or end of the string. For example, `func_1('zpythonz')` should return `False`, but the current implementation returns `True`. This indicates that the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
