Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if the string `s` contains the character 'z' within the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as an argument.
   - It uses the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` to check if the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` from index 1 to the second last index (`s[1:-1]`).
   - If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`.
   - If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This test case checks that the function returns `True` when 'z' is present in the middle of the string, which is correctly handled by the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])`.
   - `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when 'z' is at the start or end of the string, which is correctly handled because the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` fails.
   - `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: This test case checks that the function returns `False` when 'z' is not present in the middle of the string, which is correctly handled because the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` fails.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as strings with fewer than three characters, where the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` would not apply (and thus return `False`), which aligns with the problem description.

Since the program correctly checks for the presence of 'z' within the specified substring and handles all the provided test cases accurately, the program is correct according to the problem description.
