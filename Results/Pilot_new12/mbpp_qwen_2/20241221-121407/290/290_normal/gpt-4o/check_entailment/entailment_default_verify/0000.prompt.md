You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]` of the input string `s`. However, this approach fails to handle cases where 'z' is at the second last position of the string. For example, if the input string is `'pythonz.'`, the program will incorrectly return `False` because 'z' is at the second last position but not included in the check. 

To correctly implement the requirement, the condition should include checking the second last character directly:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1] or s[-2] == 'z':
        return True
    return False
```

This ensures that the function correctly identifies the presence of 'z' at positions other than the start and end of the string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters contains the character 'z'. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function checks if 'z' is present in the middle part of the string (from index 1 to the second last index). If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases where the character 'z' might or might not be present in the specified substring.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
