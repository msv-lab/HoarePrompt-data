Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether a string contains the character 'z' anywhere within its interior, excluding the first and last characters. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string `s` as an argument.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])`: This checks if the substring `s[1:-1]` (which excludes the first and last characters of the string) contains the character 'z'.
   - If the condition is true, the function returns `True`, indicating that 'z' is present inside the string but not at the start or end.
   - If the condition is false, the function returns `False`, indicating that 'z' is either not present or is at the start or end of the string.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The substring `'pythonzabc.'[1:-1]` is `'ythonzac'`, which contains 'z'. Hence, the function returns `True`.
   - `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The substring `'zxyabc.'[1:-1]` is `'xyabc'`, which does not contain 'z'. Hence, the function returns `False`.
   - `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: The substring `'  lang  .'[1:-1]` is `' lang '`, which does not contain 'z'. Hence, the function returns `False`.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and all test cases pass, the program is correct.
