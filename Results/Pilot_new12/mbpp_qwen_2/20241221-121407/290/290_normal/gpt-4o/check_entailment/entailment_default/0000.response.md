Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' at any position except the start and end of the word. It does this by checking if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string. The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The substring `'pythonabc.'[1:-1]` contains 'z'.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The substring `'zxyabc.'[1:-1]` does not contain 'z'.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False`: The substring `'  lang  .'[1:-1]` does not contain 'z'.

Since the code matches the problem description and all given test cases, the program is correct.
