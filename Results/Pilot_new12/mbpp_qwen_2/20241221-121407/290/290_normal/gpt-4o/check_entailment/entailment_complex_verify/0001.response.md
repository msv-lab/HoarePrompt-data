Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function should check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. However, the annotated version and the original assessment highlight that the current implementation of `func_1` only checks for 'z' within the substring from index 1 to the second last index, which means it can still return `True` if 'z' is at the very beginning or the very end of the string. For example, `func_1('zpythonz')` should return `False` because 'z' is at both the start and the end of the string. The annotated version confirms that the function does not handle these edge cases correctly, leading to the original assessment being accurate.
