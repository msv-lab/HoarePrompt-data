Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the string might contain 'z' only at the start or end of the word. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` if 'z' is found at the start or end of the word. However, the current implementation only checks the substring from index 1 to the second last index, which means it will miss cases where 'z' is at the start or end of the word.

For example, the following test case would fail:
- `func_1('zoom')` should return `False`, but the current implementation will return `True` because 'z' is found in the substring 'oo'.

To fix this, the condition should check the entire string and ensure 'z' is not at the start or end:
```python
def func_1(s):
    if s.startswith('z') or s.endswith('z'):
        return False
    return 'z' in s[1:-1]
```

This updated function ensures that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word and checks the rest of the string for 'z'.
