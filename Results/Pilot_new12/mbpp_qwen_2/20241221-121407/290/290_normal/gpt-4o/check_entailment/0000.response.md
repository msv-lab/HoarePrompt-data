Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]` of the input string `s`. However, this approach fails to handle cases where 'z' is at the second last position of the string. For example, if the input string is `'pythonz.'`, the program will incorrectly return `False` because 'z' is at the second last position but not included in the check. 

To correctly implement the requirement, the condition should include checking the second last character directly:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1] or s[-2] == 'z':
        return True
    return False
```

This ensures that the function correctly identifies the presence of 'z' at positions other than the start and end of the string.
