Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means it does not account for the case where 'z' is at the second last position of the string. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return `False` for inputs like `'pythonz.'`, as pointed out in the original assessment. The annotated version confirms that the function only checks the middle part of the string, missing the check for the second last character. Thus, the original assessment is correct, and no further refinement is needed.
