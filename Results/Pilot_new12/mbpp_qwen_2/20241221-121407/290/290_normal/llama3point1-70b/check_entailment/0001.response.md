Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' in the middle of a word (excluding the first and last characters). The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word. For each word, it checks if the length is greater than 1 and if the letter 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters. This logic accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the function works as expected for all inputs described in the problem.
