Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function splits the input string into words and checks if any word contains the letter 'z' within its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters). The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `True` if any such word is found and `None` otherwise. Since the function operates as intended and correctly implements the specified logic, the original assessment is accurate.
