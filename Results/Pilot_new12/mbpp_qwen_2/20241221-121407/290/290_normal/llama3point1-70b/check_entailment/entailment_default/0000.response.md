Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It splits the input string into words and then checks each word to see if it contains the letter 'z' in any position except the first and last characters. The condition `if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:` ensures that the word has more than one character and that 'z' is present in the middle part of the word. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. Given the output hints, the code accurately reflects the problem description for every potential case.
