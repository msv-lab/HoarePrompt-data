Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if any word in the input string `s` (after splitting by spaces) has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' within the word, excluding the first and last characters. The function returns `True` if such a word is found, and `False` otherwise. The annotated comments align with the functionality described in the problem statement and the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
