Correctness: False

Explanation: The program does not return `False` when no word in the string contains 'z' within the word, excluding the first and last characters. Instead, it returns `False` only after checking all words. However, the problem description requires the function to return `None` in such cases, not `False`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
