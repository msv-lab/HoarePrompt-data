Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program returns `None` instead of `False` when no word in the string `s` meets the specified condition. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` in such cases. The annotation states that the function returns `None`, which means the program does not meet the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is not accurate.
