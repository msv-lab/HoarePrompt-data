Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string `s` as input, which matches the expected input.
2. **Splitting the String**: The string `s` is split into words using `s.split()`, which creates a list of substrings based on spaces.
3. **Checking Each Word**: For each word in the list:
   - It checks if the word has more than one character (`len(word) > 1`).
   - It then checks if the substring of the word (excluding the first and last characters) contains the letter 'z' (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).
4. **Returning True**: If any word satisfies the above conditions, the function immediately returns `True`.
5. **Returning False**: If no word satisfies the conditions after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The comments also accurately describe the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns `True` if any word in the string `s` (after splitting by spaces) has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' within the word, excluding the first and last characters. Since the implementation aligns with the problem description and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
