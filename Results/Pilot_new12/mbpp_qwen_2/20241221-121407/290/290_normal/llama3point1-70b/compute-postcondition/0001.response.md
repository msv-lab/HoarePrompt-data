Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves `word` (which comes from iterating over `words`) and implicitly uses `words` as the collection to iterate over.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `words` must contain at least one element. If `words` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `words` is a list of substrings from the original string `s`.
   - `s` is a string.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `words` is a list derived from `s`, we need to ensure that `words` contains at least one substring. This means `s` must be non-empty (because if `s` is an empty string, `words` will also be empty).

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - We need to ensure that `s` is not an empty string to guarantee that `words` contains at least one substring.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string**.
