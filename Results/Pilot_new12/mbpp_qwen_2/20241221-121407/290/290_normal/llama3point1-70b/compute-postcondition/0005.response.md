According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `words`. For the loop to execute again, `words` must contain at least one more element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string
- The length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`

For the loop to execute one more time, `words` must have at least one more element, and the state of `s` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop variable `word`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, and the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`, `words` must have at least one more element**
