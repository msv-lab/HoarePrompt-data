Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string with a length less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`.
   - `words` must have at least one more element.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for word in words:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `words` to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since we are moving to the start of the next iteration, `words` must still have at least one more element to ensure the loop can continue.
   - The condition for the function to return `True` involves checking if the length of `word` is greater than 1 and if 'z' is in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `word`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, this specific condition does not need to be satisfied immediately; it only needs to ensure there are more elements in `words`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `s` remains unchanged as it was already determined based on its initial value.
   - `words` must have at least two more elements (one more for the current iteration and another for the next iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`s` is a non-empty string with a length less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`. `words` must have at least two more elements.**

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`. `words` must have at least two more elements.**
