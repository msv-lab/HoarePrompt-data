Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with a length less than or equal to 1, or 'z' is not in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `s`. `words` must have at least one more element. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is in the substring from the second character to the second last character of `word`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns None.***
