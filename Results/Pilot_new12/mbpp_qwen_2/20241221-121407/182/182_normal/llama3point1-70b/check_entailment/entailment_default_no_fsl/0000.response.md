Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension iterates over each string in the tuple and appends the last character of each string to a new list, which is then returned. This functionality works for all potential cases, including empty strings, where the last character would be an empty string. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
