Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and collects these characters into a new list. This functionality holds true for all strings in the tuple, including cases where a string might be empty (`""`). The annotation specifies that in such cases, the returned list will contain an empty string for that position, which is consistent with the intended behavior described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
