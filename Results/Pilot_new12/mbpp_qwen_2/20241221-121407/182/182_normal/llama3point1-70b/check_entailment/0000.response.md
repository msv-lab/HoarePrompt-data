Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. This is evident from the list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`, which iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and extracts the last character of each string. Since the function behaves as expected for any input tuple containing strings, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this function would fail to handle, the program is correct.
