Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character `s[-1]`. This meets the requirement to extract only the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. Since the program handles all potential cases (as per the assumption that the input will be valid), it correctly fulfills the problem description.
