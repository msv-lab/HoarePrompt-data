Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple of strings. The output hints confirm that the function processes each string in the tuple and returns a list containing the last character of each string, even if a string is empty. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided code does not indicate any errors or missing functionalities, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
