Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This works for all potential cases, including strings that are empty (`""`), as the code will simply append an empty string to the resulting list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, and there are no apparent edge cases that the code is not handling correctly. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
