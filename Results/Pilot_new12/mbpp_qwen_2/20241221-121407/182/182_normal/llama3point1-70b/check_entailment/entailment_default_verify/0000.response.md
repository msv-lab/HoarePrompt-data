Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and extracts the last character of each string. The output hints confirm that the function processes each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and collects these characters into a new list, which is then returned. This functionality holds true for all strings in the tuple, including cases where a string might be empty (`""`). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
