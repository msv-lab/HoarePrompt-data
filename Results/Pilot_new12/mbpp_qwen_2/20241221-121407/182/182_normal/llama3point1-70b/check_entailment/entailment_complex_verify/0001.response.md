Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and collects these characters into a new list, which is then returned. This functionality aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no discrepancies between the program's behavior and the problem requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
