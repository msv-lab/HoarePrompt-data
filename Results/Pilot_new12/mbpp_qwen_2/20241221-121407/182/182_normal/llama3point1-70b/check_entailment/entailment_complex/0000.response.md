Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. The program correctly uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input tuple and extract the last character using the slice notation `s[-1]`. This approach ensures that the function works for all strings, including empty strings, which would result in an empty string being added to the output list. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
