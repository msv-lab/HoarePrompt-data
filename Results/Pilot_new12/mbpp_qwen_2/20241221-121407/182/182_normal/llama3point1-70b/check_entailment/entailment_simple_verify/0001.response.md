Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. This directly matches the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, extracting the rear index (last) element of each string in the given tuple. Since the function works correctly for any valid tuple of strings, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
