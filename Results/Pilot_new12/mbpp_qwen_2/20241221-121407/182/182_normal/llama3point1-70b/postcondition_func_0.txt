The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `strings` (a tuple of strings) and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The function processes each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and collects these characters into a new list which is then returned. This functionality holds true for all strings in the tuple, including cases where a string might be empty (`""`). In such cases, the returned list will contain an empty string for that position. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
