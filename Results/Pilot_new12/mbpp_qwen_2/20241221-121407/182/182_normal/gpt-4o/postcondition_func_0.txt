The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the last character of the respective string in the input tuple. The function handles tuples of varying lengths and strings of different lengths. If a string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string. If the input tuple is empty, the function returns an empty list.
