Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear (last) index element of each string in the given tuple. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. This solution works for tuples of varying lengths and handles strings of different lengths appropriately. The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples, and there are no hints suggesting that the function fails for any potential case. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
