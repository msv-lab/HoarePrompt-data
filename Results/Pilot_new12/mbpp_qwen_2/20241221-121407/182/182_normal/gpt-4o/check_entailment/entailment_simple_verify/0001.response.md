Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple, as demonstrated by the test cases. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each string in the tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters. There are no issues or edge cases identified that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
