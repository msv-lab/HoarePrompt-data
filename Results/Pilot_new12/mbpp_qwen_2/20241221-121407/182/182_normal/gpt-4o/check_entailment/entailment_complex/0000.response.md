Correctness: **True**

**Explanation:**
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple. This matches the problem description exactly:

- The function name and its parameters match the problem description.
- The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple.
- The function handles tuples of various lengths and strings of different lengths as required.
- The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for multiple test cases.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case of valid input, the correctness is **True**.
