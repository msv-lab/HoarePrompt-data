Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. Based on the provided test cases and the logic of the function, it appears to handle the task as described for any input tuple of strings. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation that would cause it to fail for any input.
