Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input, which contains strings. The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character of each string, which is then returned as a list. This matches the problem description exactly, as it requires the function to extract the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected, further supporting the original assessment.
