Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and appends the last character of each string to the resulting list. This logic matches the problem description and works for all the provided test cases and any other potential cases where the input is a tuple of strings.
