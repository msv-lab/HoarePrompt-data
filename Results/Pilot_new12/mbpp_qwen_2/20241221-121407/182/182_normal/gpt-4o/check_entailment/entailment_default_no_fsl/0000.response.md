Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly extracts the rear (last) index element from each string in the given tuple. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and returns a list of the last characters. This approach works for all described cases, including tuples with strings of different lengths and even empty strings. The examples given in the output hints and the assertions in the code demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the provided inputs. There are no edge cases mentioned in the hints or the problem description that this code fails to handle.
