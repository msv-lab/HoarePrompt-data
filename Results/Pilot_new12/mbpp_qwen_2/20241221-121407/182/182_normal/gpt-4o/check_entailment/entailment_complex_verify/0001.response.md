Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The annotated version supports this by explaining that the function iterates over each string in the tuple using a list comprehension and returns a list of the last characters. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
