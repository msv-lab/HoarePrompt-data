Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to extract the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The output hints confirm this behavior, indicating that the function handles tuples of varying lengths and strings of different lengths, including handling empty strings within the tuple. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints align with its expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
