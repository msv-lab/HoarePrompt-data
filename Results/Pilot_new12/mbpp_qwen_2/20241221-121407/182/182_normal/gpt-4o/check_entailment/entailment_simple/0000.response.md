Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This matches the problem description exactly. The use of a list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` ensures that each string in the input tuple is accessed and its last character (`s[-1]`) is added to the resulting list. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
