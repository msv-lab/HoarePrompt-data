Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version provides a clear explanation of how the function operates, confirming that it correctly extracts the last character from each string in the input tuple. The function `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string in the tuple and collects the last character of each string into a new list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
