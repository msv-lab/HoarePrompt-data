Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element (last character) of each string in the given tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of varying lengths and strings of different lengths, including handling empty strings and returning an empty list for an empty input tuple. The program meets the problem description and there is no indication from the provided information that the program has any issues. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
