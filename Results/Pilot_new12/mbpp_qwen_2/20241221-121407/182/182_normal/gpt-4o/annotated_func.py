#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing strings.
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing strings. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the last character of the respective string in the input tuple. The function handles tuples of varying lengths and strings of different lengths. If a string in the tuple is empty, the corresponding element in the returned list will also be an empty string. If the input tuple is empty, the function returns an empty list.
