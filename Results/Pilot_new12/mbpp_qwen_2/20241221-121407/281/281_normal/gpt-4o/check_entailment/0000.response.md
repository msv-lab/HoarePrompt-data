Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a list. The list comprehension checks each number in the input list to see if it is divisible by 2 (`num % 2 == 0`), which is the correct condition for identifying even numbers. All provided test cases are handled correctly:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`.
- `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`.

Given that the function works as expected for the provided examples and the logic appears sound, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
