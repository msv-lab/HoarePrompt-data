Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters and returns even numbers from a list of integers. The annotations support this by stating that the function takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The provided test cases in the annotated version also confirm that the function behaves as expected. No edge cases or incorrect behaviors were identified, and the function appears to be correct for all potential cases given the assumption of valid input.
