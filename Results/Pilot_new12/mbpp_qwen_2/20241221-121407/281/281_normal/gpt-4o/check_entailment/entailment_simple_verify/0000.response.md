Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code analysis. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers using a list comprehension that checks for even numbers (`num % 2 == 0`). The provided assertions in the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since the code logic is sound and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the program meets the problem description. The annotations further support this by clearly describing the state and behavior of the program at different stages. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
