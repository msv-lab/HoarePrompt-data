Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers by checking if `num % 2 == 0`. Based on the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]`
2. `assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]`
3. `assert func_1([8, 12, 15, 19]) == [8, 12]`

All these test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected. Additionally, this function should work for any list of integers, as long as the input is a list of integers. Since no edge cases or incorrect behaviors were found, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
