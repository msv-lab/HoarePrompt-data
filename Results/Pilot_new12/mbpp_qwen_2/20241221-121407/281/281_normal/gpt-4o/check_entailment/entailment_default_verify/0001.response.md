Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly filters and returns even numbers from a list of integers. The output hints confirm that the function operates as intended, filtering out odd numbers and returning only even numbers. The provided test cases and the explanation in the original assessment support this. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the output hints that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
