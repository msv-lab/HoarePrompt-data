Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out all odd numbers, ensuring that only even numbers are included in the returned list. The provided test cases also correctly validate the function's behavior with different inputs, confirming that it consistently returns the expected list of even numbers. Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
