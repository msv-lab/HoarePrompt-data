Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The implementation uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers, specifically including only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (even numbers). 

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs, returning the expected list of even numbers. Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases (such as empty lists or non-integer values), and we are assuming valid input, the function adheres to the requirements stated. Therefore, the program is correct.
