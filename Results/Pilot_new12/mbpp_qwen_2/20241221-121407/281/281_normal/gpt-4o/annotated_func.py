#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even numbers from the original `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers and includes only those that are divisible by 2 (even numbers). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, such as an empty list or non-integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives a list of even numbers from the original list.
