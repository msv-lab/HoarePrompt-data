Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code, and the logic correctly filters out odd numbers, ensuring that only even numbers remain in the returned list.**

- The function iterates through each number in the input list `numbers`.
- It checks if a number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
- If the number is even, it includes it in the new list being constructed.
- The function finally returns the list of even numbers.

Since the provided code is straightforward and correct, no additional edge cases or missing functionality need to be addressed.
