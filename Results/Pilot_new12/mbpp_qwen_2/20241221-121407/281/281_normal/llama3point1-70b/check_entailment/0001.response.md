Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and includes only those numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). Given the problem description, this function should work for all potential cases without any issues. Therefore, the program is correct.
