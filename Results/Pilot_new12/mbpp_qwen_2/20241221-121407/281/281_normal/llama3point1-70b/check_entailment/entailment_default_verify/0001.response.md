Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find even numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Since the problem description matches the functionality of the code and there are no issues identified in the provided information, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
