Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The logic `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` filters out all odd numbers, ensuring that only even numbers remain in the returned list. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code that would cause the program to fail, and the code works as expected for all potential cases within the given constraints.
