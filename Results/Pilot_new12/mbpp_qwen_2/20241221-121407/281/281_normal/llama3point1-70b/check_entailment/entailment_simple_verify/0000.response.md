Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The annotated version supports this by indicating that `numbers` is a list of integers before the function call, and the function returns a list of even numbers from the original list. The logic `num % 2 == 0` correctly identifies even numbers, and the program handles all valid inputs as per the given assumption. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
