Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers using a list comprehension. It checks each number in the list to see if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`) and includes it in the result if true. This logic works for all potential cases without any edge cases being missed. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every case.
