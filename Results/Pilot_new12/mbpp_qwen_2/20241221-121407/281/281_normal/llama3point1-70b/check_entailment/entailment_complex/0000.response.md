Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension used in the function filters out all the odd numbers and keeps only the even ones, which aligns with the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. Since the problem description specifies finding even numbers from a list of integers, and the function does exactly that without any additional conditions or edge cases that would deviate from this requirement, the program is correct.
