Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. Given the problem description to find even numbers from a list of numbers, the function meets this requirement. The logic `if num % 2 == 0` ensures that only even numbers are included in the returned list. Since there are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code, and the logic appears to handle the expected functionality correctly, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
