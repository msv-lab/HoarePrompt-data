Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension `return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` effectively filters out odd numbers, ensuring that only even numbers remain in the returned list. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds even numbers from a list of numbers, and the provided code satisfies this requirement without any issues or missing edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
