Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should find even numbers from a list of numbers. The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`, checks if the number is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`), and includes it in the resulting list if it is even. Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness is True.
