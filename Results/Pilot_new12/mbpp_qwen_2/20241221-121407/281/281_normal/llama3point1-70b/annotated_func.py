#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even numbers from the original list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code, and the logic correctly filters out odd numbers, ensuring that only even numbers remain in the returned list.
