The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. If all elements match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes handling cases where the list is empty, in which case it also returns `False` since there are no elements to compare. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
