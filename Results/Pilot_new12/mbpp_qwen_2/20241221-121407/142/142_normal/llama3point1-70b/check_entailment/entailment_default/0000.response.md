Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst, element)` checks if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function to iterate over each item in the list and verify if the condition `item == element` holds true for all items. If all items match, `all()` returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach handles all potential cases, including an empty list, where it would return `False` since there are no elements to compare. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
