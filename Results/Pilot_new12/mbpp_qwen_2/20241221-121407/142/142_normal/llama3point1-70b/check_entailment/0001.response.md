Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all()` function combined with a generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` will return `True` only if every item in the list `lst` is equal to `element`. This matches the problem description exactly, and there are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which this function would fail based on the given problem statement.
