Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs. It uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. 

- If all items in the list are indeed equal to the given element, `all()` returns `True`.
- If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, `all()` returns `False`.

This behavior precisely matches the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
