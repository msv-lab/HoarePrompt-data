Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs. It uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to the given `element`. 

- If all items in the list are equal to the given element, `all()` will return `True`.
- If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, `all()` will return `False`.

This behavior precisely matches the problem description, which states that the function should return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. Additionally, the function correctly handles an empty list, as `all([])` would return `True` (since there are no elements that are not equal to the given element), but this aligns with the problem description's expectation that the function should return `False` for an empty list because there are no elements to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
