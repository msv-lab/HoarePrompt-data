Final: **True**

Reasoning: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all()` function combined with a generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` will return `True` only if every item in the list `lst` is equal to `element`. This matches the problem description exactly. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns `True` if all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
