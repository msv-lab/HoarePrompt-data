Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, including handling cases where the list is empty, returning `False` because there are no elements to compare. The function uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression, which iterates through the list and verifies if each item matches the given element. This approach ensures that the function will return `True` only if every item in the list is equal to the specified element, aligning perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
