Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The annotation states that the function returns `True` if all elements match and `False` otherwise, including the case where the list is empty. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires checking if all items in the list are equal to the given element. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid and supported by the annotated version.
