Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function `func_1` checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The use of the `all()` function combined with a generator expression ensures that the function returns `True` only if every item in the list is equal to the specified element. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. The annotations also mention that the function handles cases where the list is empty, returning `False` in such cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotations.
