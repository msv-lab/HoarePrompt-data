Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function uses the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression to compare each item in the list with the given element. If all items match, `all()` returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case of an empty list by returning `False`, as there are no elements to compare. Given the problem description and the output hints, there are no missing functionalities or edge cases that the code is not handling.
