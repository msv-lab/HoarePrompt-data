Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The annotations clearly state that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the specified element and `False` otherwise. This behavior perfectly aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
