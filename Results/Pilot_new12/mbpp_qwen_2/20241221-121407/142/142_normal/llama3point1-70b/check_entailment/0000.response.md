Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. It uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to iterate through the list and verify if each item matches the given element. This approach ensures that the function will return `True` only if every item in the list is equal to the specified element, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Since the function behaves as expected for any given list and element, there are no cases found where the program does not work as intended.
