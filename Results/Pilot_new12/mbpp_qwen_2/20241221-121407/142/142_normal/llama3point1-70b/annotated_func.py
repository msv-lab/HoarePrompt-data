#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value to compare against all items in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. If all elements match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes handling cases where the list is empty, in which case it also returns `False` since there are no elements to compare. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
