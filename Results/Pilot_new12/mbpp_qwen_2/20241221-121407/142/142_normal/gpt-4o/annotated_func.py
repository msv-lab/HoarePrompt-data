#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is any value.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, `item` is the last element in the list (if the list is not empty), or `item` is undefined (if the list is empty)
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an element `element`. It iterates through each item in the list `lst`. If any item in the list is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the function checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` if at least one element in the list is not equal to `element`, and returns `True` if all elements are equal to `element`. An edge case is when the list is empty; in this case, the function also returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to `element`.
