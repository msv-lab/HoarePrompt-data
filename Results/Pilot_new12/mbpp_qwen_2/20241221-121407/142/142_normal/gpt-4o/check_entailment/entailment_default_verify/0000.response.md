Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, and the function behaves as expected in those cases. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function correctly identifies when all elements in the list are equal to the given element and when at least one element differs. The original assessment is supported by the code and the test cases.
