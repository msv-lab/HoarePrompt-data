Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) and check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function iterates through each item in the list using a `for` loop.
   - For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to the given element.
   - If any item is found to be not equal to the given element, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to the given element, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the function will also return `True` because there are no items that are not equal to the given element. This is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions check various cases:
     - When the list contains different elements, it should return `False`.
     - When the list contains the same element repeated, it should return `True`.
     - When the list is empty, it should return `True`.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all potential valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
