Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The logic within the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If all items are equal to the given element, it returns `True`. 

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. The first test case uses a list with different elements and a non-matching element, which correctly returns `False`.
2. The second test case uses a list with different elements and a non-matching element, which also correctly returns `False`.
3. The third test case uses a list with all matching elements, which correctly returns `True`.

Since the function works as expected for the provided cases and the logic appears to handle all potential edge cases (such as an empty list, a list with one element, etc.), the program is correct.
