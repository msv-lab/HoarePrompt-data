Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The logic within the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If all items are equal to the given element, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as intended. Specifically:
- When the loop finds an item that is not equal to the given element, the function correctly returns `False`.
- When the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to the given element, the function correctly returns `True`.
- The function also handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `True`, as there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.

Given that the provided test cases cover various scenarios and the annotated version supports the correctness of the function, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
