Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. 

The annotated version clearly shows that the function checks each item in the list against the given element and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the comparison. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and demonstrate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
