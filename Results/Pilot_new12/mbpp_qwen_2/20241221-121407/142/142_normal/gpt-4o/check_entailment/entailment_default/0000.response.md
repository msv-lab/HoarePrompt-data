Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the functionality described in the problem statement accurately. The function `func_1` iterates through each item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to the given `element`. If any item is not equal to the `element`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to the `element`, the function returns `True`. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including an empty list, which would result in `True` since there are no items that are not equal to the `element`. All provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected. Therefore, the code correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
