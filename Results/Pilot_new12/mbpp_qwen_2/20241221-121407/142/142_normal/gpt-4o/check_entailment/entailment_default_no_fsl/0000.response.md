Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` as per the problem description. It iterates through each item in the list and checks if any item is not equal to the given element. If it finds any item that is not equal to the element, it immediately returns `False`. If no such item is found, it returns `True`. The code handles the case where the list is empty, which would also result in `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the element. All provided assertions pass, and the code logic matches the described functionality.
