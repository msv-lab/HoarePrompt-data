Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The provided output hints also confirm this, stating that the function returns `False` if at least one element in the list is not equal to the element and returns `True` if all elements are equal to the element. Additionally, the function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `True`, which aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the program is correct.
