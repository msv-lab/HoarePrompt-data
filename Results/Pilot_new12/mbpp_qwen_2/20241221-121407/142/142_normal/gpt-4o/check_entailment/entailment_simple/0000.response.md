Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) as inputs and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `element` (any value).
   - The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, so there is no need to handle cases where the input is not a list or is empty. This assumption aligns with the provided assertions.

2. **Loop through the List**:
   - A `for` loop iterates over each item in the list `lst`.
   - For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to the given `element`.

3. **Return Condition**:
   - If any item in the list is found to be different from the given `element`, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatch (i.e., all items are equal to the given `element`), the function returns `True`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover various cases:
     - `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False`: All items in the list are not equal to 'blue'.
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`: All items in the list are not equal to 7.
     - `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`: All items in the list are equal to 'green'.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and the provided test cases validate this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
