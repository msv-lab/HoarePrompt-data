Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. 

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list with no matching elements (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']`, 'blue') and correctly returns `False`.
- The second assertion tests a list with no matching elements ([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) and correctly returns `False`.
- The third assertion tests a list with all matching elements (['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') and correctly returns `True`.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic is sound, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
