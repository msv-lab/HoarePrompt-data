Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The logic within the function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If all items are equal to the given element, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. It correctly describes the state of the program before and after the execution of the for loop. Specifically, after the for loop, the state of the program is accurately described as `lst` being a list where all elements are equal to `element`, and `item` being the last element in the list (if the list is not empty), or `item` being undefined (if the list is empty). This aligns with the function's behavior of returning `True` only if all elements match the given element.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
