You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is any value.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, `item` is the last element in the list (if the list is not empty), or `item` is undefined (if the list is empty)
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an element `element`. It iterates through each item in the list `lst`. If any item in the list is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the function checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` if at least one element in the list is not equal to `element`, and returns `True` if all elements are equal to `element`. An edge case is when the list is empty; in this case, the function also returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to `element`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
