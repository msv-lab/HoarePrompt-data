Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The logic in the function ensures that if any item in the list is not equal to the given element, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such item, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and confirm the function's correctness. The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness by explaining the states of the program and how the function behaves. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
