You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any such item, it returns `True`. 

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- The first assertion tests a list with no matching elements (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']`, 'blue') and correctly returns `False`.
- The second assertion tests a list with no matching elements ([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) and correctly returns `False`.
- The third assertion tests a list with all matching elements (['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') and correctly returns `True`.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic is sound, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an element `element`. It iterates through each item in the list `lst`. If any item in the list is not equal to `element`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any item that is not equal to `element`, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the function checks whether all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` if at least one element in the list is not equal to `element`, and returns `True` if all elements are equal to `element`. An edge case is when the list is empty; in this case, the function also returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to `element`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
