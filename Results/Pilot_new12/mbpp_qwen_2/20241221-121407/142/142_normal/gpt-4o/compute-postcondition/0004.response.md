According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list with at least one element, and `item` is the first element in the list, which is equal to `element`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `lst` must still have at least one element (since it is stated that `lst` has at least one element at the start).
- `item` will be the next element in the list.

Since we are at the start of the next iteration, `item` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least one element, `item` is the second element in the list**
