Output State: **`lst` is a list where all elements are equal to `element`, `item` is the last element in the list (if the list is not empty), or `item` is undefined (if the list is empty)**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `lst` is a list of elements, and `element` is any value.
- **Loop Code:** The loop iterates over each item in the list `lst`. For each item, it checks if the item is not equal to `element`. If it finds an item that is not equal to `element`, it immediately returns `False`.
- **After the Loop Executes 1 Time:**
  - `lst` must have at least one element.
  - `item` is the first element in the list.
  - `item` is equal to `element`.

- **After the Loop Executes 2 Times:**
  - `lst` must have at least two elements.
  - `item` is the second element in the list.
  - If `item` is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`.

- **After the Loop Executes 3 Times:**
  - `lst` must have at least three elements.
  - `item` is the third element in the list.
  - If `item` is not equal to `element`, the function returns `False`.

From these observations, we can conclude that for the loop to finish executing, every element in the list `lst` must be equal to `element`. If even one element is not equal to `element`, the function will return `False` at the first instance where this condition is met.

If the loop completes without finding any elements that do not match `element`, it means all elements in the list are equal to `element`. In this case, `item` would be the last element in the list (or undefined if the list is empty).
