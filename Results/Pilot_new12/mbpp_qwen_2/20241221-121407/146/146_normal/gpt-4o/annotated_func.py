#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of this list. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` references any one of them.
    return max_len, max_list
    #`The program returns max_len which is the length of the list with the maximum length in `list_of_lists`, and max_list which references any one of the lists with that maximum length`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists, and returns two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references one of the lists with the maximum length. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the greatest length. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` will reference any one of those lists. The function handles the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty, in which case `max_len` would be 0 and `max_list` would be an empty list.
