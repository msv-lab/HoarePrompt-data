The code assigns `lst` to `max_list`. This means that `max_list` now references the same list that `lst` references, while the lengths of the lists in `list_of_lists` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`**
