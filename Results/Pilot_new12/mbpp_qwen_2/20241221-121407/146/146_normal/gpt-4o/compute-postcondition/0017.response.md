The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the list with the maximum length in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references any one of the lists with that maximum length.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists, and returns `max_len`, the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references one of the lists with the maximum length.**
