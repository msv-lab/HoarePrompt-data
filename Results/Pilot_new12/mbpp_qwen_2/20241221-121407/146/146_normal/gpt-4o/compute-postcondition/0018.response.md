Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists, and returns two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references one of the lists with the maximum length. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the greatest length. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` will reference any one of those lists. The function handles the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty, in which case `max_len` would be 0 and `max_list` would be an empty list.**
