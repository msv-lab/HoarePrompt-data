The code assigns the length of `lst` to the variable `max_len`. Since `lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, the value of `max_len` will be the length of this list. The reference to `max_list` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `max_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`**
