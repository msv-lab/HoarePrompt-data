The code assigns the current list `lst` to the variable `max_list`. This means that `max_list` now references the same list that `lst` references, and the length of `max_list` is the same as the length of `lst`. The `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`, and `max_len` is the length of the current list `lst`.**
