The code `max_len = len(lst)` updates the value of `max_len` to the length of the list `lst`. The initial value of `max_len` is greater than the length of the current list `lst`, but now it is updated to the actual length of `lst`. The other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list, `max_list` is the current list `lst`, and `max_len` is the length of the current list `lst`.**
