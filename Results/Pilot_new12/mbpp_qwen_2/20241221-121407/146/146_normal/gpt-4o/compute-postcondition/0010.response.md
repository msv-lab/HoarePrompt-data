Postcondition: ***`lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of this list. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_list` references `lst` and `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst`. Otherwise, `max_list` and `max_len` remain unchanged.***
