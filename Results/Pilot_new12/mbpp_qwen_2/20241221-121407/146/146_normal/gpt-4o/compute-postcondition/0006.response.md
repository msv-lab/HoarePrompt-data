Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list. After executing the if-else block, `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of this list. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` references any one of them.***
