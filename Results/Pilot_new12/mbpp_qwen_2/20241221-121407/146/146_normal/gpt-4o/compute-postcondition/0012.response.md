The code sets `max_len` to the length of `lst`. Before the execution, `lst` references a list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length. After executing the code, `max_len` will be updated to the length of `lst`, but `lst` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` references the next list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`.**
