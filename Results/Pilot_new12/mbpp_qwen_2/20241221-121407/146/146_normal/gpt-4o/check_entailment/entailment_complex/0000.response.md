Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input and returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references one of the lists with the maximum length.

2. **Handling Multiple Lists with Maximum Length**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through each list in `list_of_lists`. It keeps track of the maximum length found so far and updates the `max_len` and `max_list` variables accordingly. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` will reference any one of these lists, which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty. In this scenario, both `max_len` and `max_list` will be set to an empty list (since no list exists to update them).

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the comments confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, ensuring that it consistently returns the correct maximum length and one of the lists with that maximum length.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all specified edge cases, it meets the problem description perfectly. Therefore, the correctness is True.
