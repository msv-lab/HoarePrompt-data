Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns both the length of this maximum list and the list itself as a tuple.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists.
   - It initializes two variables, `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
   - A `for` loop iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if its length is greater than `max_len`.
     - If so, it updates `max_len` to the current list's length and sets `max_list` to the current list.
   - After the loop, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions check different cases:
     - One with multiple lists of different lengths.
     - One with multiple lists having the same maximum length.
     - One with a list of a single element.
   - These cases cover various scenarios, ensuring that the function behaves correctly across different inputs.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The function always returns the length of the longest list and any one of the lists with that maximum length.
   - It handles cases where there might be multiple lists with the same maximum length by updating `max_list` in each iteration, ensuring that it captures the most recent list with the maximum length.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, making the correctness **True**.
