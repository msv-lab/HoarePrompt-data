Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates through each list in the input, keeps track of the maximum length found so far, and updates the corresponding list when a longer list is found. The assertions provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
