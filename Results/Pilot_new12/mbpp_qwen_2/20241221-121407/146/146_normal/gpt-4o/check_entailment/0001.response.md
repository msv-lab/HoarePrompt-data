Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length in a list of lists and returns both the length and the list itself. The function iterates through each list in the input, updates the maximum length and corresponding list whenever a longer list is found, and finally returns the correct result as demonstrated by the test cases. Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.
