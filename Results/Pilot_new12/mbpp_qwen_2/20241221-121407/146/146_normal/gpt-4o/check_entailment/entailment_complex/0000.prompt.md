You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])
assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])
assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_list` references the list in `list_of_lists` with the maximum length, and `max_len` is the length of this list. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` references any one of them.
    return max_len, max_list
    #`The program returns max_len which is the length of the list with the maximum length in `list_of_lists`, and max_list which references any one of the lists with that maximum length`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists, and returns two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which references one of the lists with the maximum length. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists` to find the list with the greatest length. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, `max_list` will reference any one of those lists. The function handles the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty, in which case `max_len` would be 0 and `max_list` would be an empty list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
