Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each list in the input `list_of_lists` to find the list with the maximum length. It correctly updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever it finds a longer list. The function handles the case where the input list might be empty, returning `(0, [])` in such a scenario. Given the assertions and the problem description, the code seems to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
