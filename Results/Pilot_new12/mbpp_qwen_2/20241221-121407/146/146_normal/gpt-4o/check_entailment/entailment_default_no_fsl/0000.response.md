Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It initializes `max_len` and `max_list` to keep track of the maximum length found and the corresponding list, respectively. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`, updates `max_len` and `max_list` whenever a longer list is found, and handles the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including lists of varying lengths and an empty list scenario, confirming that the function works correctly for all tested cases. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the code appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
