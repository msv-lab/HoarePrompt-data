The code creates a new list `max_sublists` that contains only the sublists from `list_of_lists` whose lengths are equal to `max_len`. This does not modify the original `list_of_lists` or `max_len`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each element is a list; `max_len` is the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list containing only the sublists from `list_of_lists` whose lengths are equal to `max_len`.**
