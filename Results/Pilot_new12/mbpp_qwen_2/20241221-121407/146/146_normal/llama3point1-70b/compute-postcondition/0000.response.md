The code calculates the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists` and assigns this value to `max_len`. However, the actual lengths of the sublists in `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. The value of `max_len` is determined but no new variables are introduced or existing variables are altered beyond this calculation.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list; `max_len` is the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`**
