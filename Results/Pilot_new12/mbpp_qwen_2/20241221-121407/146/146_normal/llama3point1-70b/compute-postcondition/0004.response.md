Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length among all sublists within `list_of_lists`. Then, it identifies and returns the first sublist from the list of sublists whose lengths are equal to this maximum length, along with the value of `max_len`, which represents the maximum length found.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `StopIteration` error when attempting to calculate `max_len` because there are no sublists to iterate over. To handle this case, the function should check if `list_of_lists` is empty before proceeding with the calculation.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function returns the first one it encounters. There is no additional logic to handle ties or to return all such sublists.

**Summary of Actions:**
- Calculate `max_len` as the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
- Identify and return the first sublist from the list of sublists whose lengths are equal to `max_len`.
- Return `max_len` and the identified sublist.

**Final State:**
- The function returns two values: `max_len` (the maximum length among all sublists) and `max_sublists[0]` (the first sublist with the maximum length).
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function raises a `StopIteration` error.
