Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length. However, the problem description asks for a list of all sublists of maximum length, not just the first one. For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [1, 2]]`. All sublists have the same length (2), so the expected output should be `[ [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [1, 2] ]`, but the function will only return `[1, 2]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
