Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program returns only the first sublist of maximum length, but the problem description asks for a list containing the maximum length and the corresponding sublist(s). For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]`. The output should be `[3, [3, 4, 5]]`, but the program will return `[3, 5]` instead. This means the program does not handle cases where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length correctly.
