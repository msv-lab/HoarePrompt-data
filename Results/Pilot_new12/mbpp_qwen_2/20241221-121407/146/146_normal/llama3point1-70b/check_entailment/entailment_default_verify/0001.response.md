Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks for a list of all sublists of maximum length, but the function returns only the first sublist of maximum length. This can be seen from the output hints, which state that the function returns the first sublist with the maximum length, not all such sublists. Therefore, the program does not fully satisfy the requirements specified in the problem description.
