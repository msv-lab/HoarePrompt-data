Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not return a list of all sublists with the maximum length as required by the problem description. Instead, it only returns the first sublist with the maximum length. For example, if there are two sublists with the same maximum length, the function will only return one of them, which is not the intended behavior. To fix this, the function should return all sublists with the maximum length.
