Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` is still returning only the first sublist of maximum length instead of a list of all such sublists. The annotation indicates that `max_sublists[0]` is being returned, which means only the first sublist meeting the criteria is being included in the result. This contradicts the problem description, which requires the function to return a list of all sublists of maximum length. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
