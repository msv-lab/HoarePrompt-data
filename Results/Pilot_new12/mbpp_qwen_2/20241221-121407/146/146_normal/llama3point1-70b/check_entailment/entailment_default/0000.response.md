Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, whereas the problem description asks for a list of all sublists with the maximum length. For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10]]`. The maximum length is 3, and there are two sublists with this length: `[6, 7, 8]` and `[9, 10]`. The function should return a list containing both of these sublists, but instead, it only returns `[9, 10]`.

To fix this, the function should modify the line:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```
to:
```python
return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

This change ensures that all sublists with the maximum length are returned, as required by the problem description.
