Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` returns only the first sublist of maximum length, not a list of all such sublists. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists of maximum length. The annotated version does not provide any indication that the function meets this requirement. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the given problem description.
