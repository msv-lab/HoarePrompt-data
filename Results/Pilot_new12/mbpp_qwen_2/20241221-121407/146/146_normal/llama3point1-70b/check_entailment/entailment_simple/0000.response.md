Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it returns both the maximum length (`max_len`) and the first sublist of the maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). According to the problem description, the function should only return the list of sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one.

To make the program correct, it should return `max_sublists`, which contains all sublists that have the maximum length. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```

This version ensures that all sublists with the maximum length are returned, as required by the problem description.
