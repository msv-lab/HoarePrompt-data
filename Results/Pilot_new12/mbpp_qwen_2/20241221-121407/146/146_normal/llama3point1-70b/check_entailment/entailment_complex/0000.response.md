Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description completely. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. However, the program currently returns only the first sublist with the maximum length:

```python
return max_len, max_sublists[0]
```

To make the program correct, it should return all sublists that have the maximum length. Here's how the corrected version would look:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```

With this correction, the function will return both the maximum length and all sublists that have this maximum length, thereby adhering to the problem description.
