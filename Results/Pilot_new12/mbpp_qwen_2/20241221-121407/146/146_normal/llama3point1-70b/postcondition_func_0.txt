The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length among all sublists within `list_of_lists`. Then, it identifies and returns the first sublist from the list of sublists whose lengths are equal to this maximum length, along with the value of `max_len`, which represents the maximum length found.
