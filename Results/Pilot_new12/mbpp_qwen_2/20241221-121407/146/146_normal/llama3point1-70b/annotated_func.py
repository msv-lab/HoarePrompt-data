#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #`max_len` which is the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists` and `max_sublists[0]` which is the first sublist from the list of sublists whose lengths are equal to `max_len`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It calculates the maximum length among all sublists within `list_of_lists`. Then, it identifies and returns the first sublist from the list of sublists whose lengths are equal to this maximum length, along with the value of `max_len`, which represents the maximum length found.
