Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the three input lists. 

Here's why it is correct:
- The function accepts three lists as parameters, which aligns with the problem statement requiring three lists.
- It uses the `sorted()` function to sort the combined list resulting from `list1 + list2 + list3`.
- The combined list includes all elements from the three input lists, ensuring that the final output contains every element present in the input lists.
- The sorting ensures that the returned list is sorted, which is also required by the problem statement.

Since the program performs all the necessary steps to meet the problem description accurately, the correctness is **True**.
