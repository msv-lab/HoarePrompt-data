Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single list which is then sorted using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases where the input is valid (i.e., the inputs are indeed lists). The function handles merging and sorting correctly without any missing logic or edge cases that could cause it to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
