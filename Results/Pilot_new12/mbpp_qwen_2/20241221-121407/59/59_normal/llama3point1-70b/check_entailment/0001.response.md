Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This approach correctly merges and sorts the lists for any given input. Since the built-in `sorted` function works with any iterable and produces a sorted list, this function will handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, there is no case where this program would fail to meet the requirements.
