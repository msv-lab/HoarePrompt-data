Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single list and sorts the combined list in ascending order using the `sorted` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with duplicate integers. Since the `sorted` function works correctly with any iterable, the function will handle all inputs as required by the problem description. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
