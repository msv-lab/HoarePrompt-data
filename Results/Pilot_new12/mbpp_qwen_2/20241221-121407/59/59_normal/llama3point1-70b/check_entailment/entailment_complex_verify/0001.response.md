Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as inputs, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using Python's built-in `sorted` function. The annotated version correctly describes the behavior of the function, including handling potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing duplicate integers. The `sorted` function will handle all these cases correctly. Since the function meets the problem description of merging three lists into a single sorted list, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
