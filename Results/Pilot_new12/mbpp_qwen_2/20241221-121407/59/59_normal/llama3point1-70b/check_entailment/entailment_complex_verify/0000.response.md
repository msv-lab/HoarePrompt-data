Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code `func_1(list1, list2, list3)` accomplishes this by concatenating the three input lists using the `+` operator and then applying the `sorted()` function to sort the resulting list. The annotated version correctly describes the behavior of the function, indicating that it combines the lists and sorts them in ascending order. Since the `sorted()` function handles both empty lists and duplicate integers correctly, and the problem description does not specify additional requirements or constraints, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
