Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts three parameters (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`), each of which is expected to be a list of integers. The function combines these three lists into a single list using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists. Then, it sorts the combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. The sorted list is returned as the output.

The problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The annotated program accomplishes this by first combining the lists and then sorting them, which exactly fulfills the requirement. Additionally, the function handles potential edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing duplicate integers correctly because the `sorted()` function can handle these scenarios without issues. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
