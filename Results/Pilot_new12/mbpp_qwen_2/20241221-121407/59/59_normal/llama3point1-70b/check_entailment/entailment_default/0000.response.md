Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function. The output hints confirm that the function combines and sorts the lists as described. There are no edge cases mentioned that the current implementation fails to handle, and the provided code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
