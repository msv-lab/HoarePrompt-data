Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input, merges them into a single list, and then sorts the combined list in ascending order using Python's built-in `sorted` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles merging and sorting correctly, even in edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing duplicate integers. Since the problem description asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list, and the provided implementation satisfies this requirement without any logical errors or omissions, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
