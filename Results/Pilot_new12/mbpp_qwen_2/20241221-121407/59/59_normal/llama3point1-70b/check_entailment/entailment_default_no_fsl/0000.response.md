Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(list1, list2, list3)` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it in ascending order. This exactly matches the problem description. The `sorted()` function will handle any edge cases such as empty lists or lists with duplicate integers correctly. Since the code behaves as expected for merging and sorting the lists, and there are no potential cases mentioned in the hints that the code fails to handle, the program is correct.
