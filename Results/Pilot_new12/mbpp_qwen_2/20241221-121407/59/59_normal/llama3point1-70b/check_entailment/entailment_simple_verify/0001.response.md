Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single list and then sorts it. The annotation confirms that the function returns a sorted list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined. Since the built-in `sorted` function works with any iterable and the operation is performed correctly, the function meets the problem description. The annotated version supports this correctness, as it accurately describes the state and behavior of the program at different points. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
