Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input and merges them into a single list which is then sorted. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected, combining and sorting the elements of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Since the inputs are assumed to be valid lists of integers, the function will always produce a correctly sorted merged list, thus meeting the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
