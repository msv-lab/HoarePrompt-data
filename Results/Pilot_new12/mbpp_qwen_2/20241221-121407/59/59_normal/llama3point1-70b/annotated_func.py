#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, each being a list of integers. It combines these lists into a single list, then sorts the combined list in ascending order. The function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists containing duplicate integers, which will be handled correctly by the `sorted()` function. There is no missing functionality as the provided code accurately describes the behavior of the function.
