Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, each being a list of integers. It combines these lists into a single list, then sorts the combined list in ascending order. The function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists containing duplicate integers, which will be handled correctly by the `sorted()` function. There is no missing functionality as the provided code accurately describes the behavior of the function.**

The function does not modify the original lists; it creates and returns a new sorted list. If any of the input lists are empty, the resulting list will only contain elements from the non-empty lists. The function ensures that all integers from the input lists are included in the returned list without regard to their original order within the input lists.
