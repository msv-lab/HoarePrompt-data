Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function handles all integer values correctly and ensures that the final output is always a sorted list, regardless of the input lists' contents or their lengths. The provided test cases also demonstrate that the function works as intended, merging and sorting the lists properly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
