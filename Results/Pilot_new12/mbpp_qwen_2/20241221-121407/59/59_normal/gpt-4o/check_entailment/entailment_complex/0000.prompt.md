You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110], [19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154], [24, 26, 54, 48]) == [4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]) == [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12]
assert func_1([18, 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1], [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 25, 58], [12, 74, 9, 50, 61, 41]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 12, 14, 14, 18, 22, 25, 25, 35, 41, 50, 58, 61, 65, 74, 75, 85]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #`The program returns sorted_list which is the sorted version of the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these three lists into a single list, sorts the concatenated list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function handles all integer values correctly and ensures that the final output is always a sorted list regardless of the input lists' contents or their lengths. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists containing duplicate values, but the function will still concatenate and sort them appropriately.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
