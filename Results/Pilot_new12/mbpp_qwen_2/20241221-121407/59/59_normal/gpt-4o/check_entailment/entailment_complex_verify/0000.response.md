Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the annotated version, and the original assessment, the program `func_1` appears to meet the requirements. The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by first combining them using the `+` operator and then sorting the result using the `sorted` function. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. The annotations confirm that the function concatenates and sorts the lists as intended, handling all integer values correctly and ensuring the final output is always a sorted list. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
