Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. This approach ensures that the final list is sorted.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists of varying lengths. The function handles these cases correctly and returns the expected results. Since the function meets the requirements for the given test cases and there are no apparent edge cases that the code fails to handle, the program is correct.
