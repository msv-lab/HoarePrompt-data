Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function concatenates the three input lists into a single list, sorts it, and returns the sorted list. Based on the problem description, the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list, and the provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function handles all integer values correctly and ensures that the final output is always a sorted list regardless of the input lists' contents or their lengths. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that the function does not handle, and the examples provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
