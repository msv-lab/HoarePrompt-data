Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, sorts the resulting combined list using the `sorted()` function, and returns the sorted list. The code handles all integer values correctly and ensures that the final output is always a sorted list regardless of the input lists' contents or their lengths. The output hints also confirm that the function handles potential edge cases like empty lists or lists containing duplicate values appropriately. Given the problem description and the examples provided, the code appears to meet all requirements for every potential case.
