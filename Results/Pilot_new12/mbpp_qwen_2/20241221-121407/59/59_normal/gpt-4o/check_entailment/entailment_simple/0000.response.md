Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as inputs, merges them into a single list using the `+` operator, sorts the resulting combined list using the `sorted()` function, and returns the sorted list. 

This approach ensures that all elements from the three input lists are included in the final output list, and the elements are sorted in ascending order. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function correctly merges and sorts the lists as expected. Since the problem description specifies no additional constraints (like handling invalid inputs or specific edge cases), and the program handles the merging and sorting as required, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
