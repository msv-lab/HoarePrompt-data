Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list as demonstrated by the provided test cases. The annotated version further clarifies the steps of the function, confirming that it first combines the three input lists and then sorts the combined list. The results of the assertions match the expected outputs, validating the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
