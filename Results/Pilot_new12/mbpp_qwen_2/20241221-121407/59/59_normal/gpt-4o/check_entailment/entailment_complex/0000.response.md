Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single sorted list. The function concatenates the three lists into one (`combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3`), then sorts the concatenated list in ascending order (`sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)`), and finally returns the sorted list. 

This approach ensures that the output is always a sorted list regardless of the contents or lengths of the input lists. The function handles all integer values correctly and manages potential edge cases like empty lists or duplicates by simply including them in the concatenation process and sorting them.

Given the problem description requires merging three lists into a single sorted list, the implementation of `func_1` fully meets this requirement without any exceptions. Thus, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
