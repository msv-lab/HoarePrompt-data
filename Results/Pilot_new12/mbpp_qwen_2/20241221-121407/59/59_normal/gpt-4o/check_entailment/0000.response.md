Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. The approach taken in the function is to first combine the three input lists using the `+` operator, and then sort the combined list using the `sorted` function. This method ensures that the resulting list is sorted because the `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order.

Given the examples provided:

1. Merging and sorting `[25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110]`, `[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154]`, and `[24, 26, 54, 48]` results in `[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]`.
2. Merging and sorting `[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]`, `[2, 5, 7, 11]`, and `[1, 4, 7, 8, 12]` results in `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.
3. Merging and sorting `[18, 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1]`, `[25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 25, 58]`, and `[12, 74, 9, 50, 61, 41]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 12, 14, 14, 18, 22, 25, 25, 35, 41, 50, 58, 61, 65, 74, 75, 85]`.

In each case, the program correctly merges and sorts the lists as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
