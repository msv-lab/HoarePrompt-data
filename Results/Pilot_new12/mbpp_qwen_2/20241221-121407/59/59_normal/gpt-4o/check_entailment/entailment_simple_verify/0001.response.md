Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, indicating that `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are concatenated and then sorted before being returned. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes them correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
