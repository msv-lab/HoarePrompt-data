#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #`The program returns sorted_list which is the sorted version of the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers. It concatenates these three lists into a single list, sorts the concatenated list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function handles all integer values correctly and ensures that the final output is always a sorted list regardless of the input lists' contents or their lengths. Potential edge cases include empty lists or lists containing duplicate values, but the function will still concatenate and sort them appropriately.
