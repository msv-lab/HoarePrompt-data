Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version supports this by stating that the program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer `n` when converted to a string. Since the problem description asks for a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, and the provided code meets this requirement without any edge cases or potential failures under the given assumptions, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
