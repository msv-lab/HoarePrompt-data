Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to take a non-negative integer and return the sum of its digits. The provided code converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the code or hints that would indicate the function is incorrect for valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the function being correct is accurate.
