Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the provided program `func_1` computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The program converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach works for all non-negative integers, including the edge case where the integer is 0. The output hints further confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0. Since there are no other edge cases or potential scenarios where this code would fail based on the given problem description, the original assessment is accurate.
