Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that the function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. The function handles the case where the input integer `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios where this code would fail based on the given problem description and the annotated version. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
