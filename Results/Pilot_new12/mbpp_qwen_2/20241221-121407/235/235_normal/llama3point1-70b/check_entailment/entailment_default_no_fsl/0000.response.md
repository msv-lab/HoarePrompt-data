Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iteration over each digit, conversion of each digit back to an integer, and summation. The function correctly returns 0 when `n` is 0. Given the problem description and the output hints, there are no cases where this function would fail to meet the requirements, assuming valid input as specified.
