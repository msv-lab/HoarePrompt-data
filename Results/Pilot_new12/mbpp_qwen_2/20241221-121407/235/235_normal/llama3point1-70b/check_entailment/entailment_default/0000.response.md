Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, as the sum of its digits is 0. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that require special handling beyond the inherent properties of integer and string operations in Python. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints.
