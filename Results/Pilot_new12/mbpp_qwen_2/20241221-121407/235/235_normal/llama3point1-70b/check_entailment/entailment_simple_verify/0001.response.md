Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach correctly computes the sum of the digits of the given non-negative integer for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The annotations align with the original assessment, indicating that the function behaves as intended and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
