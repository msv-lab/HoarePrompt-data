Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly converts a non-negative integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. The annotations confirm that the function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, which is the correct sum of its digits. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the annotations that suggest the function behaves incorrectly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
