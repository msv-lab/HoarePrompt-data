Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that `n` is a non-negative integer. The function `func_1` accepts `n` as an argument, and there are no checks to validate whether `n` is indeed a non-negative integer. However, the problem description allows us to assume the input is valid, so this is not a concern.

2. **Conversion to String**: The integer `n` is converted to a string using `str(n)`. This conversion ensures that each digit can be accessed individually.

3. **Iteration and Summation**: The string representation of `n` is iterated over, with each character (which represents a digit) being converted back to an integer using `int(digit)`. These integers are then summed up using the `sum()` function.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0. When `n` is 0, converting it to a string results in "0", and the sum of the digits is 0. 

5. **No Unnecessary Edge Cases**: The problem description does not mention any specific edge cases that need special handling. The current implementation inherently covers all necessary cases without requiring additional logic.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
