Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description specifies that `n` should be a non-negative integer. The annotated program does not explicitly validate this condition, but it assumes the input is valid, which aligns with the problem description. Given this assumption, the program works correctly.

2. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This step ensures that each digit of the number can be accessed individually.

3. **Summing Digits**: The program uses a generator expression `int(digit) for digit in str(n)` to convert each character (digit) in the string back to an integer and sums them up using the `sum()` function.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed sum of the digits, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Since the program correctly performs all the steps needed to achieve the specified functionality without any additional conditions or errors, it meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
