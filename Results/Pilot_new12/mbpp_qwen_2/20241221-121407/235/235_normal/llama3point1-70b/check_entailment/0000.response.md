Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach works for all non-negative integers. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios where this code would fail based on the given problem description.
