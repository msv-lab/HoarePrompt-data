Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation, converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. The function handles the case where `n` is 0, returning 0 as the sum of its digits. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need special handling beyond the inherent properties of integer and string operations in Python.**
