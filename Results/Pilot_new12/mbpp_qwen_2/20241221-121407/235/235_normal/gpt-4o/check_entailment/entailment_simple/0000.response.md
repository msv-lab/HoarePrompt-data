Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature and Problem Description Match**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `n`, which is a non-negative integer (as stated in the problem description).
   
2. **Logic Correctness**: 
   - The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
   - It uses a `while` loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`:
     - In each iteration, `n % 10` gives the last digit of `n`, and this digit is added to `total`.
     - `n //= 10` removes the last digit from `n`.
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - After the loop, `total` contains the sum of all the digits of the original number `n`.

3. **Assertions Validation**:
   - The assertions provided validate different cases:
     - `func_1(345) == 12`: The sum of digits of 345 is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
     - `func_1(12) == 3`: The sum of digits of 12 is 1 + 2 = 3.
     - `func_1(97) == 16`: The sum of digits of 97 is 9 + 7 = 16.
   - These assertions confirm that the function works as expected for multiple inputs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem description assumes valid input (non-negative integer), and the program handles this correctly without any additional error checks for negative numbers or non-integer inputs.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
