Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations support this by stating that the function iterates through each digit of the input number, adding them to `total`, and then returns the sum of these digits. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) all pass, confirming the correctness of the function. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
