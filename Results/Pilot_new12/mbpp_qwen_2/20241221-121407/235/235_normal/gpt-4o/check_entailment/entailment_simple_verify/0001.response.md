Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each digit of the input number `n`, adding it to the `total` variable, and eventually returns the sum of these digits. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Since the function handles any non-negative integer as expected and there are no issues with the logic or edge cases highlighted by the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.
