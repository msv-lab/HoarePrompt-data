Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The examples given (345 -> 12, 12 -> 3, 97 -> 16) are correct, and the logic inside the function is sound. It uses a loop to extract each digit from the number by taking the modulus with 10 and integer division by 10 to progressively reduce the number until all digits have been processed. This approach works for any non-negative integer, including edge cases like 0, which returns 0 as expected. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
