Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The examples given (`func_1(345) == 12`, `func_1(12) == 3`, `func_1(97) == 16`) all demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function uses a loop to iterate through each digit of the number and adds them to the `total`, it will correctly handle any non-negative integer. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the given implementation.
