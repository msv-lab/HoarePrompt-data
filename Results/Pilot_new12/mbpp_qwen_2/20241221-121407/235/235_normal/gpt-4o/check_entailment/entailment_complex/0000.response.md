Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of the digits of a given non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits.
2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration of the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to `total`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division `n //= 10`.
   - Once `n` becomes 0, the loop exits, and the function returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the original `n`.

Given the assertions:
- `func_1(345) == 12`: The digits of 345 are 3, 4, and 5. Their sum is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
- `func_1(12) == 3`: The digits of 12 are 1 and 2. Their sum is 1 + 2 = 3.
- `func_1(97) == 16`: The digits of 97 are 9 and 7. Their sum is 9 + 7 = 16.

These results align with the problem description and demonstrate that the function works as intended for various inputs. Since the function handles non-negative integers and correctly computes the sum of their digits, the program is correct.
