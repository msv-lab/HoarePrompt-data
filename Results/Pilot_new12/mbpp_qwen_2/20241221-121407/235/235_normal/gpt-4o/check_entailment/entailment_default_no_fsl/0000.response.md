Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The code uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and adds it to `total`, then removes the last digit from `n` using integer division `n //= 10`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point `total` holds the sum of the digits. The assertions in the code cover several valid cases (345, 12, and 97), and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for these cases. Since the code handles all the provided examples correctly and the logic seems sound for any non-negative integer, the program is correct.
