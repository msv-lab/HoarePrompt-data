Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version supports this by showing that for each iteration of the loop, the modulus operation extracts the last digit of `n`, adds it to `total`, and then integer division by 10 reduces `n` to remove the last digit. Once `n` becomes 0, `total` holds the sum of all digits of the original number. The examples given (345 -> 12, 12 -> 3, 97 -> 16) are correct and demonstrate the function's proper operation for various inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness.
