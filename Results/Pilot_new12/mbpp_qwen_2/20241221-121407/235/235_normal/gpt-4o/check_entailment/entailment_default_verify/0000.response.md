Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided output hints and the program's logic align with this description. The function iteratively extracts each digit using `n % 10` and reduces the number using `n //= 10`, accumulating the sum in `total`. The output hints confirm that after processing all digits, `total` holds the sum of the digits of the original number. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness without any contradictions, the original assessment remains accurate.
