Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, and it meets this requirement based on the provided examples and the logic within the function. The annotated version further confirms this by showing that the function processes the input correctly, extracting each digit and summing them up, and returns the expected result. The function handles various inputs as demonstrated by the assertions, and the logic is sound. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
