Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through each digit of the non-negative integer `n` by using the modulo operator (`%`) to get the last digit and integer division (`//`) to remove the last digit. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The function sums these digits and returns the total, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. There are no examples provided in the hints that indicate the code fails for any potential case. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
