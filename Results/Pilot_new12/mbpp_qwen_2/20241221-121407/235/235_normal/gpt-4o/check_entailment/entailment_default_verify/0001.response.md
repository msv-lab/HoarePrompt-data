Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each digit of the input number, adds them to the `total`, and returns the sum. The examples given in the original assessment (`func_1(345) == 12`, `func_1(12) == 3`, `func_1(97) == 16`) are consistent with the functionality described. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the provided code that would contradict the original assessment.
