Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. After the loop, `n` becomes 0, and `total` contains the sum of the digits of the original `n`. The function then returns the value of `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the original `n`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0, the function will immediately return 0 because the loop will not execute, and `total` will remain 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided annotation and return postconditions state that the function returns 0, but the actual function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `n`. The annotation and return postconditions are incorrect in this case. The correct postcondition should be: The function returns the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.
