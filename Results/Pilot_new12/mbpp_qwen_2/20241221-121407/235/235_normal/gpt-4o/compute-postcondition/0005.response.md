The code `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the last digit of `n` (which is `n % 10`) to the current value of `total`. 

From the initial state, `total` is `n % 10`, and `n` is `n // 10`. After executing the code, the new value of `total` will be the sum of its original value (`n % 10`) and the last digit of the updated `n` (which is `(n // 10) % 10`). 

Therefore, the new value of `total` is:
\[ \text{total} = (n \% 10) + ((n // 10) \% 10) \]

The state of `n` changes to `n // 10` because the last digit (which is `n % 10`) has been added to `total`.

Output State: **`total` is `(n \% 10) + ((n // 10) \% 10)`, `n` is `n // 10`**
