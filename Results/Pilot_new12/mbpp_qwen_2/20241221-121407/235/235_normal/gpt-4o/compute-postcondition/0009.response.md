The value of `n` is divided by 10 using integer division, which means the last digit of `n` is removed. The variable `total` remains unchanged from its initial state. 

Given the initial state: `total` is `T + (n % 10)`, `n` is an input integer.

After executing `n //= 10`, the last digit of `n` is removed, and the updated value of `n` is the integer part of `n` without its last digit. The value of `total` remains `T + (n % 10)` because no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`total` is `T + (n % 10)`, `n` is the integer part of the input integer without its last digit**
