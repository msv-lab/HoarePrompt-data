The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Initially, `n` is `n // 10`, which means `n` has already been divided by 10 in the initial state.

Let's denote the initial value of `n` as `n0`. So, initially:
- `total` is `(n0 % 10) + ((n0 // 10) % 10)`
- `n` is `n0 // 10`

After executing `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` becomes `n0 // 10 // 10`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `total` remains the same because the calculation for `total` does not depend on the current value of `n`.
- `n` is now `n0 // 10 // 10`.

Output State: **`total` is `(n0 % 10) + ((n0 // 10) % 10)`, `n` is `n0 // 10 // 10`**
