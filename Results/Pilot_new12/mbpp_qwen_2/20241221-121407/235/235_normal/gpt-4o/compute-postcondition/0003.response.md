`n` is divided by 10 using floor division (`//=`), which updates the value of `n` to its integer part after dividing by 10. The initial state of `total` is `n % 10`, which remains unchanged because the code does not modify `total`. The value of `n` after the operation is `n // 10`.

Output State: **`total` is `n % 10`; `n` is `n // 10`**
