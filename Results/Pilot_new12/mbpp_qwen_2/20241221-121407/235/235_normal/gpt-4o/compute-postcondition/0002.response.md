The code `total += n % 10` takes the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and adds it to `total`. Given that `n` must be greater than 0 and `total` is initially 0, the new value of `total` will be the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `n`, the only change is to `total`, which now holds the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `total` is `n % 10`**
