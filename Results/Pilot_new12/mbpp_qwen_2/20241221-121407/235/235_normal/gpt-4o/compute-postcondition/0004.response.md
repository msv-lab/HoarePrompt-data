Let's analyze the given state and the while loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `total` is `n % 10`
  - `n` is `n // 10`

- **While Loop**:
  ```python
  while n > 0:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**:
   - `total` is set to the last digit of `n` (i.e., `n % 10`).
   - `n` is updated to remove its last digit (i.e., `n // 10`).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop condition is `n > 0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check Current Value of `n`**:
   - According to the state, `n` has already been updated to `n // 10`.
   - Therefore, `n` in this state is the integer obtained by removing the last digit from the original `n`.

4. **Determine Next State**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - Hence, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 before the next iteration starts.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 before the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is `n % 10`, `n` is `n // 10`, and `n` must be greater than 0**
