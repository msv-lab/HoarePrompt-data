`total` is updated by adding `n % 10` to its current value. However, the initial value of `total` is not specified. Let's denote the initial value of `total` as `T`. After the operation, `total` becomes `T + (n % 10)`. The value of `n` is not changed, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`total` is `T + (n % 10)`, `n` is an input integer**
