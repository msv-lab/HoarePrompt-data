The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` of any type, and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. It achieves this by using the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. This functionality covers all potential cases where `elem` can either be present in `tup`, absent from `tup`, or `tup` can be an empty tuple. If `elem` is not found in `tup`, the function returns 0. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function also returns 0.
