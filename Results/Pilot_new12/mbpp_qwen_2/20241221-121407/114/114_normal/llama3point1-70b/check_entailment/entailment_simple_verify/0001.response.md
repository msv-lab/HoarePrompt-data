Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. The annotations confirm that the function returns the count of the specified element in the given tuple. Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
