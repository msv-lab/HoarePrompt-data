Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The hints confirm that this method works for all potential cases:

- If `elem` is present in `tup`, it returns the number of occurrences.
- If `elem` is not found in `tup`, it returns 0.
- If `tup` is an empty tuple, it returns 0.

Since the function behaves as expected for all mentioned cases and there are no edge cases or examples provided that would make the program incorrect, the code is correct according to the problem description.
