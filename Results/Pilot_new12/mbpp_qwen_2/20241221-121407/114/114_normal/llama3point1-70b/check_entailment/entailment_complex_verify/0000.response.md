Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The annotations confirm that the function handles all possible cases, including when the element is not found (returning 0) and when the tuple is empty (also returning 0). The annotated version supports the correctness of the program, and there is no evidence from the annotations or the problem description that suggests any issues with the implementation.
