Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. The output hints further confirm that the function handles all potential cases, including when the element is not found (returning 0) and when the tuple is empty (also returning 0). Given the problem description and the provided code, there is no indication that the program fails to meet the requirements or exhibits any unexpected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
