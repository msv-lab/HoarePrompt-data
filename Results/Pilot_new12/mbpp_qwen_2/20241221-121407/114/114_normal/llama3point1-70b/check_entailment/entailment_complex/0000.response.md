Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` of any type and returns the count of `elem` in `tup` using the built-in `count` method of tuples. This method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the element in the tuple. 

The problem description specifies that the function should take a tuple and an element and count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The annotated program satisfies this requirement by using the `count` method, which is designed precisely for this purpose. It handles all potential cases mentioned in the description:
- When `elem` is present in `tup`, the method returns its count.
- When `elem` is not found in `tup`, the method returns 0.
- When `tup` is an empty tuple, the method also returns 0.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid cases, the correctness is **True**.
