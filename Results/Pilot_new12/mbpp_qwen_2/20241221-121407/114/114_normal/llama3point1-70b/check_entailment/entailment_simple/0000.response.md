Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. The function then returns this count. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should take a tuple and an element and count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
