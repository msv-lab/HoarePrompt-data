Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to return the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The output hints mention that this functionality covers all potential cases, including when `elem` is not found in `tup` (returning 0) and when `tup` is an empty tuple (also returning 0). Since the function behaves as described and handles all mentioned cases, the code is correct according to the problem description.
