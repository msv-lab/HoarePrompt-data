Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1(tup, elem)` uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The output hints confirm that this functionality covers all potential cases, including when `elem` is not found in `tup`, when `tup` is an empty tuple, and when `elem` can be of any type. Since the function meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
