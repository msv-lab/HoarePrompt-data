Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. This method will handle all cases where the element exists in the tuple, including cases where the element appears multiple times, and also correctly handles the case where the element does not appear in the tuple, returning 0 in such cases. Since the program works as expected for all described scenarios, the correctness is **True**.
