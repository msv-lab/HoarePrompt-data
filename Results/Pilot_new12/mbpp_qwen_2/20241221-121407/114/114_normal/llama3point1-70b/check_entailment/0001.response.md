Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This function will work for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as empty tuples, tuples with no occurrences of the element, and tuples with multiple occurrences of the element. Since the function meets the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is True.
