Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The annotations clarify that the function handles all potential cases, including when `elem` is not found in `tup` (returning 0) and when `tup` is an empty tuple (also returning 0). Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment is maintained.
