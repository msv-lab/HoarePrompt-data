#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be any type that is comparable with the elements in the tuple.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of how many times `element` appears in tuple `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. It performs this operation by calling the built-in `count` method of tuples, which counts the occurrences of the specified element. The function handles the case where the element is present multiple times within the tuple, returning the exact count. If the element is not found in the tuple, it returns 0. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling, as the `count` method already takes care of such scenarios.
