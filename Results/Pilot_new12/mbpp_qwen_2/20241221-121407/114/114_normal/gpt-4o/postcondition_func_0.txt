The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. It performs this operation by calling the built-in `count` method of tuples, which counts the occurrences of the specified element. The function handles the case where the element is present multiple times within the tuple, returning the exact count. If the element is not found in the tuple, it returns 0. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling, as the `count` method already takes care of such scenarios.
