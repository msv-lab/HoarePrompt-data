Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. However, this approach only works correctly if the tuple does not contain duplicate elements. In the provided test cases, the tuple contains duplicate elements (e.g., `10`, `8`, `5`, `2`, etc.). 

The issue arises when the tuple has duplicate elements and the element being searched for is one of those duplicates. For instance, if the tuple was `(10, 10, 10, 10)` and the element was `10`, the function would correctly return `4`. However, if the tuple was `(10, 10, 8, 8, 5, 5)`, and the element was `10`, the function would still return `3` because it would not account for the additional occurrences of `10` in the tuple.

To ensure the program works correctly for all potential cases, especially when the tuple contains duplicate elements, the function should iterate through the tuple and manually count the occurrences of the element. Here is an alternative implementation:

```python
def func_1(tup, element):
    count = 0
    for item in tup:
        if item == element:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This version explicitly counts the occurrences of the element, ensuring correct behavior regardless of whether the tuple contains duplicate elements or not.
