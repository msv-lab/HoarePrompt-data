Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (including a non-existent element, an element that appears multiple times, and an element that appears more than once). Since the function works as expected for these cases and the `count` method handles all possible elements within a tuple, the function is correct for every potential case.
