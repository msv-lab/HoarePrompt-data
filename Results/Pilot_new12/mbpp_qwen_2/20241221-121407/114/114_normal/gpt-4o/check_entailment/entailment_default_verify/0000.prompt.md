You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. However, this approach only works correctly if the tuple does not contain duplicate elements. In the provided test cases, the tuple contains duplicate elements (e.g., `10`, `8`, `5`, `2`, etc.). 

The issue arises when the tuple has duplicate elements and the element being searched for is one of those duplicates. For instance, if the tuple was `(10, 10, 10, 10)` and the element was `10`, the function would correctly return `4`. However, if the tuple was `(10, 10, 8, 8, 5, 5)`, and the element was `10`, the function would still return `3` because it would not account for the additional occurrences of `10` in the tuple.

To ensure the program works correctly for all potential cases, especially when the tuple contains duplicate elements, the function should iterate through the tuple and manually count the occurrences of the element. Here is an alternative implementation:

```python
def func_1(tup, element):
    count = 0
    for item in tup:
        if item == element:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This version explicitly counts the occurrences of the element, ensuring correct behavior regardless of whether the tuple contains duplicate elements or not.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. It performs this operation by calling the built-in `count` method of tuples, which counts the occurrences of the specified element. The function handles the case where the element is present multiple times within the tuple, returning the exact count. If the element is not found in the tuple, it returns 0. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need special handling, as the `count` method already takes care of such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
