Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function handles the cases where the element appears multiple times, is not found in the tuple, and covers the expected functionality without requiring any additional handling. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness for the given scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
