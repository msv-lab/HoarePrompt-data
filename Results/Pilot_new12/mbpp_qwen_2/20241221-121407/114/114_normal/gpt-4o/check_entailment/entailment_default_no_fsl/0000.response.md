Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `element` and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The assertions provided cover different scenarios, including cases where the element is present multiple times and where it is not found in the tuple, returning 0. The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for these cases. Since the function handles all the given examples correctly and the problem description matches the implementation, the code is correct for every potential case.
