Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. This is achieved by using the built-in `count` method of tuples, which counts the occurrences of the specified element. 

The function works as follows:
1. It accepts two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `element` (of any type).
2. It uses the `count` method of the tuple `tup` to count how many times `element` appears in `tup`.
3. It returns this count.

The assertions provided in the comments test different scenarios:
- When the element (4) is not present in the tuple, it correctly returns 0.
- When the element (10) is present multiple times, it correctly returns 3.
- When the element (8) is present multiple times, it correctly returns 4.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided assertions cover various cases, the function is correct.
