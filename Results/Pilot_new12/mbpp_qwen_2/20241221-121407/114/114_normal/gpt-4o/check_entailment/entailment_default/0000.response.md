Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element. The provided assertions cover various cases, including when the element is present multiple times, and when it is not present in the tuple. The function works correctly for all the given test cases and there are no edge cases mentioned that need special handling. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
