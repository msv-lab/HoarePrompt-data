Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and it returns the count of how many times `element` appears in `tup`. This is exactly what the problem description states. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which is the correct approach to solve this problem. The provided test cases also validate that the function works as expected for different inputs, further confirming its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
