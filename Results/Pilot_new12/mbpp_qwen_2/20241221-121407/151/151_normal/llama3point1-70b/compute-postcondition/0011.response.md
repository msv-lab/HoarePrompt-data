To determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Analysis:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is described as `flat_list` being extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` is a list. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `flat_list`.
- The for loop iterates over `nested_list`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `flat_list` contains the elements added from `func_1(i)` or directly appended based on the nature of `i` (whether it is a list or not).

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `nested_list`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `i` from `nested_list` must be processed.
   - Depending on whether `i` is a list or not, either its elements are added to `flat_list` via `func_1(i)`, or `i` itself is appended.

### Adjusted States:
- **`nested_list`:** The first element (based on the current iteration count) needs to be removed since the loop will process this element next.
- **`i`:** This will be the next element in `nested_list`, which could be a list or a non-list value.
- **`flat_list`:** It will be adjusted based on the nature of `i`. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` will be extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, `i` itself will be appended to `flat_list`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the following adjustments are needed:
- `nested_list` will be reduced by one element.
- `i` will be the next element from `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` will be updated based on the processing of `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` will be adjusted based on the nature of `i` (if `i` is a list, extend by elements from `func_1(i)`; otherwise, append `i`).**
