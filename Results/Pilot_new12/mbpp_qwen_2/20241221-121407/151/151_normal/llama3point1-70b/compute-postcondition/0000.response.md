The code initializes an empty list called `flat_list`. This does not affect the `nested_list` variable or its content. Therefore, the only change is that `flat_list` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
