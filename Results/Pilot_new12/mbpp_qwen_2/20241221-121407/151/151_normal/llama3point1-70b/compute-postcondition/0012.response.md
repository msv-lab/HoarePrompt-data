The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the elements returned from `func_1(i)`. The value of `i` is taken from the first element of `nested_list`. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list`, and `nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is defined. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, so we denote it as `i`.

After the execution of `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))`, `flat_list` will be extended with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. The `i` and `nested_list` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` is extended with elements from `func_1(i)`**
