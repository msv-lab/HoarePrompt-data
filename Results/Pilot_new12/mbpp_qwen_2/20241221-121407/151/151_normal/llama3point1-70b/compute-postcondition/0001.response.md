According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nested_list`. The loop will execute if `nested_list` contains at least one element. 

Before the loop starts, `flat_list` is an empty list, and `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level). For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must have at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `nested_list` has at least one element.

State: **`nested_list` must have at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list**
