The given code snippet `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` extends the `flat_list` list by appending the results of `func_1(i)` to it. However, without knowing the exact values or the definitions of `flat_list` and `func_1(i)`, we can only state that `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. 

Given this, the Output State is:
**`flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`**.

If more specific information about `flat_list` and `func_1(i)` was provided, we could give a more detailed output state.
