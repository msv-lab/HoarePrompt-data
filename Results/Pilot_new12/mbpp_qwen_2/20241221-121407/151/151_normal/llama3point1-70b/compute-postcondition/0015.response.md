Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all elements are at the top level.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`.
- If an element is a list, `func_1(i)` is called to flatten that list and extend `flat_list` with its elements.
- If an element is not a list, it is simply appended to `flat_list`.

After all iterations of the loop, `flat_list` will contain all the elements from `nested_list`, including those from any nested lists, at the top level. This means `flat_list` is the fully flattened version of `nested_list`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `nested_list` is empty), both `nested_list` and `flat_list` will remain empty.
