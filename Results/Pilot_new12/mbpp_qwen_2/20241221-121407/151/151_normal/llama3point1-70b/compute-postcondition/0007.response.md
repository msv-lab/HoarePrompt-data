Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `nested_list` must have at least one element.
   - If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
   - Otherwise, `flat_list` is a list containing the first element of `nested_list`, and all remaining elements in `nested_list` are not lists.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`.

3. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must still have at least one element after the current iteration.

4. **First Element Check**: 
   - If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)` for the first element.
   - Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list` and all remaining elements in `nested_list` are not lists.

5. **Next Iteration**: To ensure the loop continues, we need to adjust the state such that:
   - `nested_list` must still have at least one element.
   - The first element of `nested_list` should be checked again to determine how `flat_list` is updated.

Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, we assume that the first element of `nested_list` is still a valid element to be processed. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

### Adjusted State for Next Iteration:
- `nested_list` must have at least one element.
- The first element of `nested_list` will be checked again to update `flat_list`.

**State:**
**`nested_list` must have at least one element, and the first element of `nested_list` will be checked again to update `flat_list`.**
