The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` extends the `flat_list` with the elements returned by the function `func_1(i)`. Since `i` is a list from `nested_list`, `func_1(i)` is called with `i` as its argument. However, the exact nature and values returned by `func_1` are not specified. Given this, we know that `flat_list` will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)` appended to it.

Since the initial state is that `flat_list` is an empty list and the current element `i` from `nested_list` is a list, after executing the code, `flat_list` will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, and the state of `nested_list` and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least one element, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, `i` is a list from `nested_list`**
