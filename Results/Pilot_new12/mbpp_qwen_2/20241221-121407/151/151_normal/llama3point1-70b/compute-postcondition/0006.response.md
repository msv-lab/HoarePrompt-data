Postcondition: **`nested_list` must have at least one element. If the first element of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` is a list containing the first element of `nested_list`, and all remaining elements in `nested_list` are not lists.**
