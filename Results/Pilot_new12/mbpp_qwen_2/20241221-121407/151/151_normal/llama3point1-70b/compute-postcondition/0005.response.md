`flat_list` is an empty list and `nested_list` has at least one element. The code appends the first element of `nested_list` to `flat_list`. After appending, the length of `flat_list` becomes 1, and it contains the first element of `nested_list`. The rest of the elements in `nested_list` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least one element, `flat_list` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `nested_list`, and each element in `nested_list` is not a list.**
