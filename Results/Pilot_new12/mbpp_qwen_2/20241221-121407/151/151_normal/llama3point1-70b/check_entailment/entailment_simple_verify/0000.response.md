Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The annotated version confirms that for each element in `nested_list`, if it is a list, the function calls itself to flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to `flat_list`. This process continues until all elements are at the top level, ensuring that the function returns a fully flattened list. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the function handles nested structures correctly without any issues. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
