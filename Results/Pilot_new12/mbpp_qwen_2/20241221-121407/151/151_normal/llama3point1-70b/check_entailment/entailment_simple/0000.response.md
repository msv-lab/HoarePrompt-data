Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version of that list, meaning it converts all nested lists into a single, flat list with no sublists remaining.

- **Base Case Handling:** The function checks each element `i` in the input `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it recursively calls `func_1(i)` and extends the `flat_list` with the result of this recursive call. This ensures that all nested lists are processed.
- **Leaf Node Handling:** If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.
- **Recursion Termination:** The recursion will eventually terminate when all elements are either directly added to `flat_list` (if they are not lists) or processed by further recursive calls (if they are lists).

Given these steps, the function correctly handles all cases where the input is a nested list structure and produces the expected flattened output. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
