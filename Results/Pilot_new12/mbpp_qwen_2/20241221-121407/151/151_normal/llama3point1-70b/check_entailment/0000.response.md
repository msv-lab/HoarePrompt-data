Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element in the list. If an element is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nested structure, are included in the final flattened list. There doesn't appear to be any scenario where this function would fail based on the given problem description.
