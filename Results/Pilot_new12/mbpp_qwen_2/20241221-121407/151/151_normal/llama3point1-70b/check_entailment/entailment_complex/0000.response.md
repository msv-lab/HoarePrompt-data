Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other nested lists. This matches the requirement specified in the problem description.

2. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to handle any level of nesting. For each element in `nested_list`, it checks whether the element is a list. If it is, the function calls itself with this sublist and extends `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to `flat_list`. This ensures that all elements are eventually added to `flat_list` at the top level.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - An empty `nested_list` will result in an empty `flat_list` being returned, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - A `nested_list` that contains no nested lists will be returned as is, as it is already flat.
   - A `nested_list` that contains only integers will also be returned as is, as there are no sublists to flatten.

4. **No Modification of Original List**: The function creates a new list (`flat_list`) and returns it without modifying the original `nested_list`. This aligns with the problem description.

Since the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
