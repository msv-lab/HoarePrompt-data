You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element of the input list, and if the element is itself a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist. Otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach handles all cases correctly, including nested lists of arbitrary depth. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that this function would fail to handle properly. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level).
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list` where all elements are at the top level.
    return flat_list
    #`The program returns the flattened version of nested_list stored in flat_list`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested list structure into a single-level list called `flat_list`. The function returns this flattened list. This process handles all levels of nesting within the input list. The function does not modify the original `nested_list`; instead, it creates and returns a new list. Potential edge cases include an empty `nested_list`, a `nested_list` that contains no nested lists, or a `nested_list` that contains only integers. The function will handle these cases by simply returning an unmodified `nested_list` if it is already flat or empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
