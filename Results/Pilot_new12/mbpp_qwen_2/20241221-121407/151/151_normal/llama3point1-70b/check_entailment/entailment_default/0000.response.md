Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a single-level list. The function `func_1` recursively processes each element of the nested list. If an element is a list, it calls itself to further flatten that sublist. If the element is not a list, it appends it directly to the `flat_list`. The function handles all levels of nesting and potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list that contains no nested lists, ensuring it works correctly for every potential case described in the problem. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description.
