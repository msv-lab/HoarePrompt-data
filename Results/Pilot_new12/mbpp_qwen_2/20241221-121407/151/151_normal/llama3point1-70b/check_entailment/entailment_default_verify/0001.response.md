Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly handles the task of flattening a nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The output hints confirm that the function correctly flattens lists of various depths and structures, including handling edge cases such as an empty list or a list that is already flat. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints align with its functionality, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
