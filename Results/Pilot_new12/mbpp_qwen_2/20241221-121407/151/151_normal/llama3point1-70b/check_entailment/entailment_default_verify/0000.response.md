Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including empty lists, nested lists containing only integers, and multiple levels of nesting. Since the function correctly flattens the nested list without modifying the original input, and it aligns with the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
