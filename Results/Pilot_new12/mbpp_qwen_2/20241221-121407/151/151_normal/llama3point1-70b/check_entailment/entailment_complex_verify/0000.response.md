Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function handles all elements, whether they are integers or lists, by either appending them directly to `flat_list` or recursively calling itself to further flatten nested lists. The annotated version also mentions potential edge cases such as an empty `nested_list`, a `nested_list` that contains no nested lists, or a `nested_list` that contains only integers, and notes that the function will handle these cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is supported by both the code and the annotations.
