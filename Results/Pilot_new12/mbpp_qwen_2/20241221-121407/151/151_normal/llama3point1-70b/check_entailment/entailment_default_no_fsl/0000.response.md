Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a single-level list. It handles all levels of nesting, as indicated in the problem description. The code recursively processes each element in the nested list. If an element is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist; otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nested structure, are included in the final flat list. The code also handles edge cases such as an empty `nested_list`, a `nested_list` that contains no nested lists, or a `nested_list` that contains only integers, as described in the problem description.
