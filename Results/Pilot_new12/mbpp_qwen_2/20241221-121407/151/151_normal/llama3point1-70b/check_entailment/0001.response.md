Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element of the input list, and if the element is itself a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist. Otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach handles all cases correctly, including nested lists of arbitrary depth. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that this function would fail to handle properly. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
