The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the result of `func_1(item)`. However, the specific value of `item` and the exact behavior of `func_1` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `flat_list` has been extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`**
