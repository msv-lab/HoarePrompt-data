The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` impacts the `flat_list` by extending it with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Since the current item being processed is a list, `func_1(item)` will return a list of elements from `item`.

The initial state is that `nested_list` contains at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, and the current item being processed is a list. After executing the code, `flat_list` will be extended with the elements from `func_1(item)`.

Since `func_1(item)` returns a list, let's denote this list as `new_elements`. Therefore, `flat_list` will be updated to include these new elements.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` is now a list containing the elements from `func_1(item)` and was previously empty; the current item being processed is a list.**
