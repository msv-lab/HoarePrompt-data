The code initializes an empty list named `flat_list`. This does not affect the `nested_list` variable or its contents. Therefore, the `nested_list` remains unchanged, and only `flat_list` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list**
