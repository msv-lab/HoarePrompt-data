Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `nested_list` contains at least one element.
   - `flat_list` is updated to include all elements from `nested_list` processed by `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list, or to include `item` directly if `item` is not a list.

2. **Analyze the For Loop**: The for loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, there must be at least one element remaining in `nested_list` to process.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop processes one element per iteration, after one iteration, there will be one less element in `nested_list`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `nested_list` should contain at least one element (one less than it had at the end of the previous iteration).

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state for the start of the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element, and `flat_list` is updated to include all elements from `nested_list` processed by `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list, or to include `item` directly if `item` is not a list.**

Note: The exact contents of `nested_list` and `flat_list` will change with each iteration, but the condition that `nested_list` must contain at least one element remains the same for the loop to continue.
