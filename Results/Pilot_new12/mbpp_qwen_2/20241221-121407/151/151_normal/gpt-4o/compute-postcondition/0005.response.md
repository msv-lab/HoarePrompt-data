`flat_list` appends `item` to its end. The value of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Since `item` is appended to `flat_list`, the updated state of `flat_list` includes the newly added `item`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` contains an additional item from `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element; `flat_list` contains an additional item from `nested_list`**
