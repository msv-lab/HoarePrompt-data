State before the loop starts: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `item` and the structure of `nested_list`. The loop will iterate over each item in `nested_list`. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as `nested_list` contains at least one element.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `nested_list` must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is at least one item to iterate over in the loop.
- `flat_list` remains empty since the problem statement mentions it is initially empty and does not change this condition for the loop to execute.

So, the final state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list**
