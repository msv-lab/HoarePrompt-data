To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the loop:

1. **Initial Condition**: The `nested_list` must contain at least one element.
2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - For each `item` in `nested_list`:
     - If the `item` is a list, `flat_list` gets extended by `func_1(item)`.
     - Otherwise, `flat_list` gets an additional item from `nested_list`.

Given these points, we need to consider what happens at the end of the previous iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check Initial Condition**: Since the loop continues as long as `nested_list` contains at least one element, we know that `nested_list` has at least one element before starting the loop.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume `nested_list` had at least one element at the start.
   - During the previous iteration, we processed one item from `nested_list`.
   - There are two possibilities based on the type of `item`:
     - If `item` was a list, `func_1(item)` was added to `flat_list`, but the `item` itself was removed from `nested_list`.
     - If `item` was not a list, it was directly added to `flat_list`, and then the `item` was removed from `nested_list`.

3. **For the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, `nested_list` must still contain at least one element.
   - Therefore, after processing one item (which could either be a list or a non-list), `nested_list` should still have at least one element left.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration, `nested_list` must still contain at least one element, and the `item` being processed could be either a list or a non-list element, but the critical condition is that `nested_list` should not be empty.

So, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`nested_list` must contain at least one element.**
