`flat_list` appends the value of `item`. Since the exact value of `item` is not specified in the initial state, it will simply be appended as is. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` contains at least one element, `flat_list` is updated to include all elements from `nested_list` processed by `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list, or to include `item` directly if `item` is not a list; `flat_list` includes the appended `item`.
