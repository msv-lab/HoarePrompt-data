`flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` contains at least one element, `flat_list` will include all elements from `nested_list` processed by `func_1(item)`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element; `flat_list` includes all elements from `nested_list` processed by `func_1(item)`**
