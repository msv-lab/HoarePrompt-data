The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or other lists nested to any level. It recursively processes `nested_list` to flatten it into a single list `flat_list` containing all integers found within `nested_list`. If an element in `nested_list` is itself a list, `func_1` calls itself on that sublist to further flatten it. If an element is an integer, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. The function ensures that all integers from `nested_list` are included in `flat_list`, regardless of their original nesting level. The function does not modify `nested_list`; instead, it creates and returns `flat_list`. Potential edge cases include empty `nested_list` or `nested_list` containing only integers, in which case `flat_list` will be the same as `nested_list`. The function handles any depth of nesting and includes all integers, even if they are deeply nested.
